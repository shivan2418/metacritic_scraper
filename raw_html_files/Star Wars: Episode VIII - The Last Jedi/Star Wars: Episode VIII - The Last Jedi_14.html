Did no one tell them that Star Wars was popular because people liked it as it was, that people liked the story, characters, and even the serious tone? Is it necessary to turn everything into a superhero movie full of bad jokes? Well, I'm sad for two reasons, first and foremost, I no longer look forward to see any future Star Wars movies, what made them special is not there anymore, and secondly, why all blockbusters have to be carbon copies nowadays? Where did imagination and originality go?? I can't believe that with all the money they have, they cannot do better. Clearly they aim for children and teenagers that will fangirl at the possible love lines. But even the children get tired at some point when you only offer cheap copy-paste.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Judging this purely as a movie and not 'a star wars movie' it is still awful. The plot was incoherent and uninteresting, the characters were two-dimensional and uninteresting (in spite of some good acting). I could not care less about any of the new characters (noting that by contrast I was very entertained by Rogue One). The writer/director has very effectively killed off any curiosity I had about the SW universe or the characters within it. As any SciFi fan knows, creating a rich framework/setting for the story is essential, you need to feel as though you are looking through a window into something much bigger and more interesting - this movie fails utterly in this regard. There is now no reason to be curious about any of the characters or the larger SW universe (which now has no continuity and makes little sense).<br/><br/>Yes, the visuals and sound were great in TLJ, but you need so much more to make a movie entertaining. As someone who is not a big SW fan this was just a bad movie. The interesting thing is that so many people seem to really like this film despite all of the major flaws in plot, script, humor and character development. Forget whether or not this was 'good fan service' purely as a movie it really stinks!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The first time I watched this movie I felt confused and started picking it apart. I thought there were gaping holes and unexplained or unnecessary plot devices, but instead of settling on that I went back for repeat viewings. Once the shock of everything that happens was no longer a factor, I started to notice the nuances of the story. This movie doesn't beat you over the head with its ideas, but all the bits I thought had holes turned out to have been in front of my nose the whole time. Every question I had about why a character did what the did was there for me, in a part of the film.<br/><br/>This film will divide the fans from the fanatics, and that's okay. In any case, drop your preconceived notions and expectations, and let the story take you in. See it a few times to get all the bits you didn't get the first time. You'll be glad you did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The director of The Last Jedi had to take a pretty horrible start to the trilogy and try to make it fresh and interesting for this movie. While he does succeed at shaking things up, this movie is very jarring to watch. New ideas are introduced and then thrown away. There were two MAJOR questions brought up in the Force Awakens that are literally answered with bad jokes in this movie. As if to say **** you to the fan theorists out there. One of the new characters is completely useless, Finn is reduced to a secondary character with no purpose at all. And don't get me started on the subplots... the subplots are insanely frustrating to watch. They have no purpose, no real outcome and much of the movie is illogical. The only redeeming story lines are Rey and Kylo's relationship as well as Luke's introduction into his beliefs of the force. Other than that, the movie is paced and edited badly and there are MANY plotholes.<br/><br/>All that being said, the movie has some amazing visuals and cinematography. It probably has one of the best scenes in Star Wars history, and the ending is surprisingly cool and fun to watch. If you want to see some new ideas in the Star Wars universe, you got it, but dont be fooled. This film has some major issues (again mainly with pace and editing), but its better than the Force Awakens... by a longshot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The most common description of The Last Jedi by paying customers, as opposed to paid reviewers, is that The Last Jedi is "a dumpster fire of a movie". This is an insult to dumpster fires across the galaxy. The lack of continuity, tonal inconsistency, ham-fisted social messaging and rickety story architecture mean The Last Jedi feels like group-work project by a handful of the more promising film studies students at a top notch third tier university.

What were they thinking. Well here are the things I didn't like.<br/>The movie did not know when to end! I swear the final action was in the  3rd act then it just ended like we survived luke died let's go to are base. But when Luke died they were just like yeah I felt him die whatever, they did not even cry one  tear. They did end with a lightsaber fight, but when Luke was cut in half by Kylo ren his body doesn't fall off it's just a holograph. How Luke actually dies is by killing himself. He jumped off the mountain. Why would he do that? The reason why Ben solo go's to the dark side is plain stupid. Luke tries to kill him cause he saw evil in him, but Kylo just tries to kill Luke then kills every student jeez. It was blatantly obvious rey was going to be the last Jedi. They don't do any twists and they act like rey is definitely going to be the last Jedi when they could make her act like a brat. The story is obvious. It's obvious Ben solo would kill snoak cause he wants to be in charge. This movie just sucks The things I liked. The characters where consistent the parts with Finn and rose are good Poe Dameron was good and the acting was fine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's a good movie - just not necessarily a good Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not a bot. Nor do I hate diversity - I loved it in this film and TFA. I am, however, a "fanboy", but not a misogynist racist neo-Nazi like some of the critics out there would have you believe.<br/><br/>This film has been discussed ad infinitum all over the Internet, so let's get straight to it:<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/>Plenty to like about this film. George Lucas was right that it was "beautifully filmed" - breathtaking vistas, Crait, Holdo's lightspeed jump - the excellent filmography continues from Rogue One. The acting was good too - Mark Hamill gives the performance of his career (even if his Luke wasn't true to character) and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver have improved tons from TFA. I loved Yoda - puppet Yoda being silly was still in character, in my opinion, and his lines make sense. I have no problem believing that the most powerful Jedi ever can call down lightning even as a Force ghost. Also Luke Force-projecting at the end wasn't new - Yoda did it first in the animated Star Wars Rebels. And even though I have complaints about Luke, that final duel was badass.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/>Let's do a little thought experiment. Go rewatch the throne room scene in Return of the Jedi. Watch Luke slice Vader's hand off and then catch himself. See him throw his lightsaber away and tell the Emperor "I am a Jedi, like my father before me". He refused to kill the second most evil man in the galaxy - and that faith turns Vader back to the light side. Now watch TLJ. Can you really believe that this same Luke would raise a lightsaber against his sleeping nephew, Leia's son? Now you have the reason most fans are disappointed about Luke's portrayal - TLJ Luke isn't Luke. He would maybe mope about for a while, but there's no way in Jabba's arse that he wouldn't come back to help Leia. Rey and R2 knew it too - they used Leia to try and persuade Luke, and the Luke of the original trilogy put his family and friends over everything else. Him dying at the end, while poignant, also could have been better written - I felt an iconic character like Luke Skywalker deserved better overall.<br/><br/>Wasted villains are a cardinal sin to me. Snoke was wasted - I understand he had to die, but that could have been done so much better. Completely unrealistic how he is built up to be such a powerful Force user and doesn't see the betrayal coming even though he is LITERALLY READING KYLO'S MIND AT THE TIME. Phasma appears on screen, is badass - then dies unceremoniously after forgetting how to use a gun on Finn. Hux, once actually menacing and ambitious in TFA, is reduced to Monty Python levels of comedy here. And the entire First Order appears incompetent - how did they even conquer the galaxy between TFA and this film? At least Lucas did proper worldbuilding in his prequels.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT:<br/>Perhaps the most chilling thing about The Last Jedi is how well Disney can control the media narrative. Film critics are a finicky bunch - it's suspicious how they have all unanimously lined up to sing praises about The Last Jedi. This has not gone unnoticed - commenters at The Guardian have asked why their usually picky film critics left glowing reviews without any faults, the Angry Joe Show recanted their criticism after posting a 2-million-view video ranting about TLJ's problems, and for every article correctly pointing out that TLJ is underperforming for a Star Wars movie, there are 10 more saying how it's raking in billions at the box office and how it's God's gift to cinema, etc etc. Even The Phantom Menace got some good reviews initially - so when ALL the critics line up in one choir to praise a film to the heavens, you know something fishy's going on.<br/><br/>In the end, it's our right to like or dislike a film - and just because some people dislike this one doesn't mean we should be ridiculed or talked down to, especially not when we've supported the franchise for decades.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The first time was a lot to take in and my expectations (one of the important themes in the movie) seemed to have not been met initially. With a closer eye and a little more attention, in the end the movie really did meet all my expectations, just not how I envisioned them. The movie masterfully manages to balance humor and fun with failure and disappointment, summarizing it all beautifully with the scene between Yoda and Luke. Afterwards things start turning around as characters begin to look past themselves and their failures to come to terms with where they are now, what about themselves must change or be left behind, and what must be done to both atone and move forward. Unbelievable movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The story suck there are so many plot holes that I stopped counting, every single scene brings some inconsistancies that could potentially kill the film. The acting is good I guess, but the characters have 0 charisma, most of them are useless anyway. The pace is terrible, there is no link between scenes, everything is either too long or too short : the beginning take 1.5 hours is so boring and the end is a 1 hour long endless fight with no passion. Yes your read it well there is no "middle" between beginning and end in this film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

We all know that Carrie Fisher died last year, and so I assumed this one scene would be here end. But no... How? It is not explained and that is horrible. It feels so misplaced and awkward, it hurts. So she still lives in this movie, and on the other hand she is dead and nobody knows what will be with her in the next movie. This makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>Lukes appearance in this movie should have been cut out. The way he is portrayed here makes absolutely no sense to his character at all. This movie is so full of "what the... why?" that it hurts. So I hope Episode 9 starts with Rey waking up, realizing she had a really intense dream and then the story kinda progresses.<br/><br/>But like this? No. There was a building up - a tension in this movie where I really thought ok, she will become a sith and Kylo will become a jedi again. But no. And the end of.. Snoke? We don't even know who he is, and apparently he is dead now? or isn't he?<br/><br/>This movie just makes no sense.

Wake up.  A human writer in 2016 wrote this film, just because it is written this way does not change Luke Skywalkers legacy forever.  Its called "a movie" lol...people are acting as if Luke Skywalker is a real person lol...this is one of the funniest reaction in movie history.  Anyway, this was a great Star Wars film, better than the last one that felt like a complete rehash and copy of every other Star Wars film, and I even liked it a little bit better than TFA.  People have complained mostly about their beloved Luke Skywalker and an idealized storyline for him that probably did not come "true"  (don't meet your hero's) and other more minor things such as the humor, and lack of in depth explanation on some of the characters.  Well the film is 2 1/2 hours I don't think there would be much more time to explain any other characters backstories.  That could be a movie unto itself.  It works for this film.   The humor is a little different than other Star Wars films, instead of Han Solo type sarcasm, there is a more subtle, off-beat, dead-pan humor through-out which I really enjoyed and mostly worked fine.   It also focuses a lot on "the force" and uses CGI to show what some of the thought processess of using the force might be like which they of course did not have in 1977 or even 2000.  Again...it really worked well and was an interesting take on the subject matter.  As is the case with 1980's the Empire Strikes Back...the 2nd one is my favorite in the trilogy and Last Jedi is my favorite Star Wars film of the last decade or more.  Unless you project non-sensical images of what a character SHOULD be or SHOULD do and act as if this is life and death and a real person lol...you should enjoy this movie if you reasonably like Star War's films to any degree.  9/10 and up there with the better Star Wars films and possibly the best of the new ones.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

On the surface it has many elements natural to the series, and many that bear a striking resemblance to its predecessors, but that’s not why it fails.  It fails because it’s nonsensical, lackadaisical, and heretical. Firstly the good: I don’t agree with the approach they took with Luke (just like I didn’t with Han in TFA), but I didn’t find his part difficult to accept. Reading between the lines and looking back and older movies makes his actions believable enough if you will it so. He doesn’t get bested by Rey; he abandoned the force and has no drive to live. Strangely enough some of the jokes were funny (success rate was under 50%, excluding Hux-related jokes which were 0%). Now that the good is out of the way, let’s look at this movie’s 3 main failings.<br/><br/>The movie is lackadaisical because it doesn’t know its audience. It desperately tries to appease to youngsters and older fans may be insulted. It doesn’t settle into a rhythm. There is a flimsy interlude at a casino, mostly just so Finn and Rose can rescue some ugly horses, but it’s like a scattershot cantina scene with zero personality. Numerous times—the movie frequently does terrible jumps between locations—Poe desperately asks for a plan as they stay one step ahead of the first order, only to be ignored or insulted for no good reason. Even Rey and Ren (sans stupid helmet thankfully) commune via astral-projection to allow for dull exposition between two opposing sides without needing to justify frequent physical encounters. The final lightsaber battle is pretty weak honestly.<br/><br/>It’s nonsensical because illogical things happen. The resistance (aka rebellion) are virtually nothing, despite so many previous victories. Laser projectiles curve downwards in space. The first order’s best ships can’t manage to spot transport vessels leaving the last remaining cruiser despite being in visual range. Do none of these futuristic spacecraft have autopilot? Two characters somehow come out alive in an explosion while the enemies that were surrounding them are toast.<br/><br/>Finally it’s heretical because it tosses the lore aside. This one it does deliberately and callously. It makes sense, Lucas is gone and all that deep lore is a burden for new directors/producers. Start with a clean slate, right? This is like cutting off your nose to spite your face. Lore is Star Wars and Star Wars is lore. You can build layers, like the prequels, you can add your own stories, like KOTOR, and, hell, you can even fill the gaps, like Rogue One. What you can’t do is wipe it all away and opt to not replace it, but The Last Jedi does just that. As the second movie in a trilogy you would expect to be interested in where it goes next, but I could not care less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Firsly I loved Rogue One last year it felt like a story worth telling and introduced some new interesting characters. I hated the Force awakens and would rate it as my least favourite star wars movie! So i was really hoping The Last Jedi would take the Rogue One approach........It didn't!! So much potential with Luke and they just made him a grumpy old man who feels sorry for himself because his nephew turned to the dark side! Out of all people Luke should of been prepared for this potential eventuality......his dad is Darth Vader for heavens sake! So to turn him into a coward like this was unforgivable for me.<br/>Lazy writing throughout, no coherent exciting storyline, too much feminism and poor character development but ultimately it just wasn't a fun film to watch.

I am beyond shocked that this movie has gotten such good reviews; I don't think that I have ever disagreed with critics more. The positive reviews are completely wrong on almost every point of praise they make...shockingly so. I genuinely didn't believe in media control until watching this movie and reading the positive reviews. Star Wars "love" aside, this movie is just bad on every level and the absolute only logical explanation for the overwhelmingly positive reviews is that Disney bought the reviewers. Again, this movie is bad on every level...there are even some incredibly atrocious special effects in this movie (though the majority of the movie is visually impressive). As I mentioned, I created this account for the sole purpose of giving this movie the bad rating it deserves. I am not going to waste my time getting into the details of everything that is wrong. If you are interested in learning more, just read through all the negative posts on this board because they are ALL correct in their criticism.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

That's pretty much it.<br/>Now the bad things... Well, I will just say some that left me disappointed and saddened.<br/>First, the scene were Leia comes back to the spaceship after surviving an explosion and wandering in space... what?! How did she come back? How did she survive being in the vacuum of space? Not just the cold, but her eyes would have popped from her head.<br/>We have Snoke and Phasma's deaths occurring prematurely (in my opinion) making those characters completely worthless. You might argue how the same thing happened with Palpatine and Boba Fett, but here's the thing. Palpatine and Boba Fett were characters that appeared when the SW universe was still "in creation", as Snoke and Phasma were introduced in a already existing one, with books, movies, cartoons, HQ's and more. Palpatine even has some more backstory and lore added to his character trough the Book of the Sith aswell.<br/>J. J. Abrams vision on Luke is sh*t. I understand that people change over the years, but what happened to Hamill's character was a complete failure. Luke sulking on that island, refusin to help Rey, wanting to end the Jedi... It hurts to think about that.<br/>The whole story about how and why Ben became Kylo Ren, his "connection" with Rey... That's was just bad. It was weak. His character grows more and more unbearable and meaningless, with goals that are just too cliché to be good.<br/>The movie itself, cast, photography, soundtrack are all good, for someone that don't really cares about the SW Universe, it might be a good movie. But if you were a fan already this is gonna be hard for you to watch. Abrams was a mistake, Disney was a mistake.<br/>Star Wars didn't die as hero and became a villain with a poor new trilogy and new games that just want to consume your money made by mErcenAries.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Instead of the media investigating if bots are to blame for low audience ratings, the media should investigate how it was able to garner such high critical praise--strong-arming? bribery?  Because TLJ is a very, very bad film.  And not bad in a way that can be blamed on one person's tastes compared to another, but bad in ways that are otherwise undeniable in the eyes of critics: the writing is horrendous; the plot is all over the map but somehow ends with the main characters, as well as the the rebellion and empire, in exactly the same place as the beginning of the movie--i.e. in 2.5 hours of plot hole after plot hole,  NOTHING HAPPENS other than setting up for another money-grabbing sequel; all of the major story turns are repeats of the original trilogy; the themes are sophomoric even for Star Wars, especially the whole "learn from your mistakes and let them go" bit that Luke, a supposedly enlightened Jedi supremely in touch with the interconnectivity of the universe has to learn from a second-coming of Yoda.  Viewers can argue about the casting (horrible), the camp humor (bad), and Star Wars nerds can argue about the director taking the franchise in a different direction, but there is no way that critics can sincerely praise this film; something else is going on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Every time the movie is about to take a risk or do something interesting, it turns around. Everyone (who lives) winds up right back where they started. The very basis of a story, especially Star Wars, is the hero's journey, with the final piece being 'and then they returned, changed.' Nobody changes. Why would they? The bad guys are all goofy friendly cartoon characters who are in no way intimidating.  I have no idea what they were thinking when they wrote this.<br/><br/>To put it another way, it feels like the first draft of a script that needs to be cut down, followed by a rough edit of that script that, again, needs to be cut down and fixed. What a mess! Don't give The Mouse your money for this one. If you see it 'just because it's star wars,' then they'll slap the title on anything without any fear of failure.<br/><br/>I know the originals weren't perfect. I know episodes I II and III were a mess. That is no excuse to make objectively stupid decisions when plotting out new movies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There is greatness as in the Luke and Vader confrontation, but also many glaring problems like an unfocused narrative, Ewoks, Boba Fett and at parts very clunky dialoge.<br/>The Last Jedi has a great dynamic between Rey, Luke and Kylo Ren. But it also has glaring problems like an overly long story where everything feels underdeveloped with glaring plotholes, characters acting completely out of character (Luke) and adding pointless new characters and subplots. Instead of focussing on the exciting parts (Reys training) we constantly cut to the mildly interesting escape attempt of Leias fleet and an attrociously bad side story with Finn and some uninteresting side characters.<br/>Also the movie got really disneyfied with weak attempts at silly Marvel-style humour and a bunch of useless stuff they shoved in to sell toys and appeal to kids (like alien birds and foxes and a bunch of crap on a casino planet).<br/>Really disappointing that The Last Jedi has much more in common with Episode 6 and the prequels rather than Episode 5 or something new.<br/>I really hope they will deliver a more focused story and make more use of Rey and Kylo in Episode 9, cause that's what people actually want to see</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movies plot was very weak as was the script direction humour and lore everything was off the mark even the language felt wrong for a starwars movie. The rebellion who won 30 years ago and should of been in power have been reduced to the resistance the what? Yeah the resistance instead of the rebellion. We were expecting a Fin and Rey movie discovering the force and becoming jedi and we were treated to the po dameron show they should of stuck to their guns and killed him off in the first of the trilogy. Still they've done the same lame thing with the bf2 single player campaign which is utter trash. The director claims to be a starwars fan but i have my doubts. Was that Yoda using force lightening to burn the tree? Isn't force lightening a dark side force? It has been in every piece of starwars so far. After bf2 and these two terrible movies I'm done with starwars the franchise for me finished at return of the Jedi. Screw Disney and screw Rian or whatever his name is I'll be boycotting them both from now on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It feels like Star Wars through several degrees of adaptation. Not just a sequel of a sequel of a sequel, but like a live-action adaptation of a cartoon based on a line of toys based on a sequel of a sequel of a sequel. There were some inventive moments which were all the more frustrating for their wasted potential. Plot and character motivation were as senseless as The Force Awakens, and none of the questions (or plot holes) raised in that movie were answered. And was it not enough to have Luke spurt green seacow milk into his beard—must the udders also look like genitalia?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie felt shallow and incoherent and seemed to rely to much on special effects and stuff blowing up, than having a meaningful experience. About half way through I felt like it should be wrapping up soon but was repeatedly quickly disappointed that the action would pick up again and I would have to endure another long round of nothing really making much sense and too many explosions... what was the main plot? The characters were extremely annoying and shallow. If you insist on making more Star Wars movies, please do something better than this pile of vomit.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8002373"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded"> While there are many critiques of some of the issues with this movie I will focus on a few that really ruined it for me. The 1st and biggest for me is the portrayal of Luke. in this move we are supposed to believe that Luke just gave up and went to some island to die because Ben Solo started to turn to the Dark Side. This basically undoes all character progression we see for Luke in episodes 4-6. This was just a leap to far for me and really pulled me out of the movie. i probably could have gone along with this plot point if they had spent some time developing this point. Instead all we got to support this was a few short flashbacks and some very short exposition. Maybe they could have cut the pointless Canto Bight stuff and spent some time here). One possible way this could have been down would be if Luke had been married and Ben Solo killed his spouse. I probably would not have liked this but I could have gone along with it. <br/><br/> Many people have said there is precedent for Luke going into exile because both Yoda and Obi Wan did the same. I don’t buy this. In this film Luke just gives up and goes into exile to die. Obi Wan went to Tatooine to watch over Luke and try and make sure Vader/Palpatine didn’t find Luke. Yoda went to Dagoba to bide his time and see if there might come a way to undo what had been done. From my perspective they both still carried a spark of hope. Luke just gave up with little explanation as to why. Are you freaking kidding me!?!?<br/> The next point I will talk about is the overall tone of the movie. The writer seemed to go out of his way to make sure we knew the that all the stuff from episodes 1-7 does not matter from this point on. There were some serious nihilistic undercurrents here. He went out of his way to say it doesn’t matter who Snoke is. It doesn’t matter who Rey’s parents are. The Jedi origins and history don’t matter. By the end of the movie the resistance is basically decimated with 1 ship and about 20 people surviving. I get that Disney probably wants to reset things so they can take the series in some different directions but did they have to go out of there way to tear down just about everything that came before to do it?  I really wish they would have finished out episodes 8 and 9 before trying to reset everything. The last point I will make is that the writer/director seemed to go out of his way to subvert every expectation. While I like some surprises i wish they were tied to a better story. I couldn’t escape the feeling that I was being trolled throughout this movie. You expect to find out about Rey’s past? Nope!. You expect to find out how the first order came to be? nope! you expect to find out more about Snoke? Nope You expect Admiral Holdo to act rationally and explain the plan so people know they are not just waiting for a slow death? Nope. Who are the Knights of Ren? Nope! You expect Luke to not be a bitter old man who doesn’t care that his sister is in grave danger? Nope! You expect that Finn will retain some of the character growth he had from the last movie? Nope! You expect Finn to go out and sacrifice himself to save what is remaining of his friends? Nope!  You expect Poe to not act like a complete ass twice? Nope! You expect this film to make sense given the existing canon? Nope!<br/><br/>It seems like the movie was just one big head fake after another at the expense of making a movie that makes sense in the context of what came before. Its as if the director was so concerned with the criticism that the force awakens was just a retread that they decided to throw everything out the window whether it made sense or not. There were some of these surprises that I liked (especially the throne room fight). But overall I think this movie is a mess that destroys more than it builds. Worst of all the destruction has effectively eradicated my desire to see any more of the Disney Star Wars. I really enjoyed Rogue One and i thought The Force Awakens was ok. I even appreciated some aspects of the prequels. But this one just left me confused and disappointed. There is a Youtuber named David Stewart who has a few videos breaking down the issues with this movie (in a better fashion than I can). One of the points he made was that this movie has the aesthetic of a Star Wars movie but it does not have the heart of one. There is no heart here just window dressing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The out of place humour belittled characters and destroyed any dramatic tension. Luke Skywalker's character transformation was badly conceived and his conclusion unsatisfying, why go to the cinema to see that ending. There were numerous plot holes, one of the worst lead to the whole Casino world story which gave me flash backs to the Phantom menace. The way the force was handled in the movie didn't align with how it worked in earlier films. I simply wasn't entertained.

I'm not stuck in the past. I'm not against change. I'm just a regular guy that enjoys Star Wars movies. I signed up to Metacritic today because I am amazed at 1) how terrible "The Last Jedi" was and 2) how anybody could give this movie a decent score.<br/><br/>There are so many many problems with this movie, and these problems are well vetted by other users, so no need to rehash. But there are legitimate reasons to hate this movie well beyond the blindly dismissive buzzwords like "toxic masculinity" and "stubborn fanboys".<br/><br/>I will just give one example of how terrible this movie is. There is one scene in a casino where an alien dressed like Mr. Monopoly Pennybags (monocle and tuxedo) tries putting coins in BB-8, mistaking the droid to be a slot machine. Later in the movie, BB-8 fires these coins and kills stormtroopers. Let that sink in.<br/><br/>I've polled 30+ friends/family/co-workers on this movie. My admittedly informal poll found that those that thought the movie to be terrible were older, male, successful, traditional values, and of higher IQ (not all mutually exclusive). Anybody that was a big fan of the original trilogy categorically loathed the movie. Those that loved the movie (I found very few) were typically children and younger adult females.<br/><br/>If you loved the movie, I'm very happy for you. In fact, I'm jealous. But just know the way in which you are entertained is very different than the way in which I am entertained. Disney horrifically changed the tonality and subsequent audience for these films. They clearly pivoted the brand. I think I speak for many people given the negative user scores and quickly eroding gross receipts.<br/><br/>To that point, sadly I will not be going to Solo or Episode IX on opening weekend as I typically do. I may not go at all. I'll wait for the reviews first. This movie was so bad that it made me stop caring about Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But this movie is an abomination. If it were totally standalone, it would be an average kind-of-enjoyable thing with many plotholes. But like this...it destroys the mythology, and offers nothing except meh-meh to replace what it destroyed. I WANTED to be surprised, but not in such a way that the surprises all ring hollow and/or unconvincing.<br/>Let's see why...<br/>Luke contemplating killing Kylo...nope. This happens to be a personal obsession of Rian's - "if you met Hitler while still a kid, would you kill him?" Check out his movie Looper for proof of this. And it could have been convincingly placed in this mythology...only it isn't. Something like that has to be earned, not shoehorned in. And yeah, it does character-assassinate Luke, this is simply not him, not even if he changed. An example (only one of the possible ways this could have been made convincing, and no it wasn't my idea to start with, got it from someone on the Net): if Ben/Kylo and all or most of Luke's students got converted by Snoke and rebelled, Luke may have been forced to kill them while crying, then could not bring himself to kill his own nephew. This WOULD have ****** him up to such a degree that he may have been the Luke we see in the movie. But not sensing unspecified darkness within Kylo, that just does not cut it from the same person who almost sacrificed himself to turn Vader. Oh, and it would have plugged the gaping "where the hell are the Knights of Ren" plothole quite neatly to boot. Not to mention paralleled both Anakin's slaughter of the younglings, AND Palpatine's making short work of everyone except Mace Windu in the prequels. A Luke to whom this happened would have cut himself from the Force - as he would no longer know just what the difference was between him and Vader/Palpatine. The way it's shown in the movie...what would be Luke's first natural reaction after the Kylo situation happened? Well, to talk it over with Yoda and Kenobi's ghosts. And how did he "cut himself off from the Force" anyway? Kylo would not think he was dead, because he would have felt it...aaargh!!!!!<br/><br/>Space Leia...oh dearydear...not only does she save herself, she apparently also Force-reconstructs the Mon Calamari cruiser's bridge, since it seems rather intact later in the movie...'nuff said. RIP Carrie, you deserved a much better sendoff...<br/><br/>Rose - yeah, annoying, but don't bash the actress for that - ain't her fault. Snoke, we hardly knew ye...yeah, we did not know much about Palpatine in the OT either...but we did not need to, McDiarmid based his performance there on the figure of Death from Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Seal...and that worked very well. In the PT, it did not - and one of the major problems there was that the characters - Padme, Palpatine etc. - seemed to be pulled out of thin air with no backstory whatsoever. The only thing we learn about Snoke is that he dresses like the late Hugh Hefner, and is apparently physically based on the WW2 SS-general Ernst Kaltenbrunner. As to how exactly he would turn anyone to the dark side, can't see it at all.<br/><br/>Hyperspace tracking a new tech? And pray, how exactly did the first Death Star, or Boba Fett for that matter, track the Falcon? Or how did Obi-Wan track Jango in the PT? Through non-hyperspace? Could have pulled out of that hole by claiming that it used to require a physical tracking device to be onboard - this could even have provided a kind of reason why Holdo does not tell Poe what her plan is...paranoia and fear of FO spies (though it would still be daft that she does not tell this to the guy who just blew up that dreadnought, at least in private).<br/><br/>Crait...far as I remember, in ESB, the only reason why the Empire did not bomb the Hoth base back to Stone Age was that it has a force field...the Crait base has none, so no reason at all for the walkers 'cept that they look cool...or maybe the FO forgot to include TIE Bombers among their gear...<br/><br/>Hyperspace kamikaze stuff...oh yeah, but that makes all spaceships/Deathstars automatically obsolete. Plus the fact that they had to invent Holdo to do it (and do it way too late btw) since Ackbar has an Arab-derived name so the implications would be, oh dearydear...<br/><br/>Feminazi stuff...I don't mind feminism at all (have 2 beloved daughters), but this got turned into such men-are-stupid-cuz-they-are-but-women-rock-cuz-they-are overkill that it provokes an opposite reaction...in a perverse way, this movie is Steve Bannon's wet dream, and I sure don't feel comfortable with anyone giving THAT guy wet dreams. I half expected Rey to tell Kylo: "You're only jealous cuz I'm an actual woman, and you need to grow your hair long & act hysterical!"<br/><br/>Mary Sue Rey - others have written enough about this.<br/><br/>What a royal mess of a story. Continuity DOES matter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8001980"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I am genuinely surprised by the negative sentiment amongst fans. Complaints about lack of character development, gaping plotholes, Luke's portrayal, and certain details regarding a major plot character are all over the place. I strongly disagree with many of these points, and in part I think the backlash is due to the trailers and pre-released material not foreshadowing the change of pace to the fans. Here are my thoughts on the movie.<br/><br/>When Star Wars 7 came out, fans complained about the lack of depth, the plot development which more or less mimics the 4th movie, and the fact that 'everything kind of just worked out' (blowing up a fortified planetary base with a handful of X-wings? C’mon…). Star Wars 8 on the other hand shows the flipside of the story. Where ad-hoc plans in the 7th movie all magically work out, the 8th movie is a continuous barrage of failed ideas and disrupted plans. Most notably, the movie exemplifies that heroic plans such as sabotage on a highly-secured ship are a risk to the master plan. Time and time again the plans made by our heroes don't work out and actually worsen the situation. With a strong Rogue One vibe, this makes the 8th movie unlike any Star Wars movie that was previously released in the original trilogy of 8. Further, the 8th movie does a tremendous job at portraying the inner divide in both the Resistance and the First Order. There is mutiny in the Resistance, a power divide in the First Order, and an imbalance in the nature of the Force itself which form the central theme of the movie(s).<br/><br/>Lack of character development? Poe Dameron goes from being an impulsive troublemaker to a more considerate problem-solver during the movie. Finn learns about determination and to no longer flee from a problem when the going gets tough. Rey's naiveté is remedied as she learns about Luke's past and his wrongdoing. As for Luke himself, his story arc is remarkable to say the least. Yes, his portrayal early on in the movie is odd, but think about Yoda's quirky lifestyle in Dagobah when Luke first meets him. When he first gets confronted about an averted past he naturally reacts stoic. It would be anything but odd if he meets a force prodigy and immediately accepts to guide her given that we learn about his failure to mentor a prodigy before. When he realises the situation is dire, he still does not go back to the adage of a mentor tutoring a padawan, but instead teaches her both sides of the medallion which heralds a new breed of Jedi. As Hamil himself notes, "Because if it was just another benevolent Jedi training young padawans, we've seen it!" First Order commanders Kylo Ren and General Hux show fantastic character development throughout the movie. When Snoke is eliminated, Kylo seizes control of the fleet and Hux’ troops, much to the dismay of Hux. When Kylo fails to finish off the Resistance when they are cornered because of his personal vendetta getting in the way, Hux can be seen as livid. This power divide will undoubtedly come back in the 9th movie and should make a fantastic plotline on the power struggle of the succession of an empire.<br/><br/>That said I do have a couple of issues with the movie. Firstly, Snoke's character is barely discussed even though he was the most speculated character after the 7th movie. In part this is because he is a plot vehicle to move Kylo and Rey's storyline along, but it remains odd that such a potent Force-wielder is not discussed further. I hope that Star Wars 9 at least gives us closure on this point. Secondly, Leia being blasted into space and then suddenly floating back to the ship was odd to say the least. Then again, the movie is drenched with unusual uses of the force which strongly require explanation. This will hopefully be a central topic in the 9th movie. In its own right, the Finn-Phasma duality was finished off way too swiftly, and it could certainly be exploited much more. The casino scene is a missed opportunity to bring back the cantina vibe from the original trilogy. Aliens are all anthromorphic in one way or the other. Where are the blobs, tentacle-things, and generally absurd aliens? On this note, why do the animals have to be as cutesy as they are? On the one hand they are fitting (foxes on a desert planet, puffins on a sheer-cliffed island? Sure), but in part it feels like they were trying to cater to an audience which doesn’t ordinarily care about Star Wars and it just feels jarring. Lastly, certain jokes in the movie were a terrible fit. Finn’s rebel scum line, General Hux being toyed with by Poe, and the screaming puffins just felt out-of-place.<br/>To sum it up, the 8th movie is a refreshing change of pace from the original series. There are a lot of storylines to work out in the 9th movie and a great variety of plotholes to resolve. It has several notable flaws, but to say that the movie is as bad as most fans make it out is unjustified. It’s daring, and perhaps this change of pace is not what fans had expected.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8000436"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I generally refrain from posting reviews, but after repeatedly hearing claims that the only critics of this movie were "russian bots" or "fanatic fanboys", I was compelled to make an account and post my review.<br/><br/>Where to start?<br/><br/>The single greatest problem with The Last Jedi is the writing. From the messy plot, to the egregious oversights and contradictions, to the absurd, repetitive dialogue ("Godspeed" and "page-turner" is all I'll say); the script of The Last Jedi stymies the movie to such a degree that even if everything else about it were great, it still wouldn't be a good movie.<br/><br/>But everything else isn't great. The lead actors are wooden and uninspired (with the exception of Mr. Driver, a lone bright spot. Fisher, Serkis, and Hamill were fine too, but alas this isn't their movie), though to be fair they aren't given much to work with. There's a plethora of 'jokes', which isn't inherently problematic, until you begin to realize they're only there to keep you from falling asleep. With every change of scenery there's a new "animal" to meet, and the movie takes extra care to ensure we get a lengthy, zoomed-in shot of each one's cute, pouting face (Don't worry if you didn't see them all, numerous toy versions will be available at your nearest retailer).<br/><br/>Some of scenes are carbon-copies of those found in previous Star Wars iterations (Hoth "Salt Edition"), others look like they were plucked right out of an anime strip (Snoke's Big Send-Off). On the flipside, we do get to meet some new characters. There's Benicio Del Toro's DJ, a hacker/thief who is perpetually on the verge of having a seizure, Kelly Marie Tran's Rose Tico (A play to overseas audiences in Asia? Or a sneaky way to further marginalize Finn's character? We'll never know), and finally Laura Dern's dear Admiral Holdo, a stoic, purple-haired rebel commander who just barely manages to lose out on the coveted "Worst Battle Tactician of 2017 Award" to General Hux and the entirety of the First Order military command (Self-sacrifice isn't heartfelt unless you let half of your forces die needlessly beforehand. And where are the TIE fighters?)<br/><br/>Now, in fairness, Rian Johnson does move the franchise forward quite a bit. We learn that there's much more to the Force than previously thought:<br/>1. You can facetime your frenemies.<br/>2. Force-ghosts are a thing (those silly Jedi in the past only used Holograms)<br/>3. Remote light-saber activation (makes you wonder why we keep seeing all of this 'dueling' nonsense)<br/>4. Out of oxygen? Never fear, the force-float is here!<br/><br/>We learn there are Space casinos where everyone dresses...wait for it...exactly like they do on Earth casinos! And apparently fuel is now a big deal, although sending out your smaller ships to collect some isn't allowed for some reason. Animal cruelty is BAD (but the planetary-genocides commited by the First Order in The Force Awakens have become a thing of the past. After all, a week is a long time to remember such trivialities).<br/><br/>So yeah, that's the jist. Some people may complain about things like Luke's behavioral changes, or Snoke's unspoken backstory, or Rey's 'grounded' parents, but those things aren't important. What's important is you go into this movie without clearly formed expectations, or a clearly functioning brain for that matter. I recommend copious amounts of your favorite drug or intoxicant of choice, so you can watch the lovely special effects without wondering why the First Order ships don't use hyperspeed to overtake the fleeing rebel fleet, or why the rebel fighters are lining up to face the oncoming AT-ATs in trenches a la WWI and not hiding behind their blast-proof door.<br/><br/>If you don't, you may just start wishing for everyone to kamikaze each other.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are way too many plot inconsistencies and ham-fisted attempts at social commentary in this film for it to actually be entertaining. I found myself so distracted by the forced representation of current political issues that it completely failed to teleport me to a "long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...."<br/><br/>For me, the absolute deal-breaker comes when ghost Yoda burns the ancient Jedi texts, citing that they're not page-turners and that Rey has all of the knowledge that she needs without them. If we remove the thin veil from this metaphor and apply it to our own world, you'll see that Master Yoda is really burning the Holy Bible and claiming that it is not necessary. I can't be a fan of this franchise any longer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Amongst many others concept of bombers having to be physically above big bad ship in space before they can drop, mind blowingly bad.<br/>Character arcs for old characters do not fit with any previous films.<br/>The force no longer makes any sense, Leah?

I'm willing to forgive its flaws in return for its sheer entertainment value, but as the second movie in a Star Wars trilogy it never quite reaches the heights of The Empire Strikes Back.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7999935"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The opening crawl decides that, contrary to the previous film, the resistance has actually LOST and now the First Order has completely taken over the galaxy. How the force did that happen? It seems every one of these films starts with “about everything that happened before? Yeah, we’ve nuking that.” This is then followed by a ridiculous scene involving yo mama jokes and the resistance losing all of its bombers because they apparently can’t move more than 2 inches per minute.<br/>The first order destroys one of the resistance flagships, and Leia is flung out into space and dies…BUT WAIT! She now has mad Force skills and can not only survive in space, she can FLY LIKE SUPERMAN through it. I mean what the serious **** She falls into a coma after this, and the resistance is ruled by Kathleen Kennedy’s Real Grannies of Outer Space, who don’t take no lip, new ideas, or sensible talk from these young boy whippersnappers who just need to get off my bridge! Pretty much 80% of the resistance and every important person who isn’t Poe is now female.<br/>Finn wakes up from a coma, and goes into Jar Jar Binks mode. Then meets Poe and decides he’s gotta go tip his fedora at Rey because reasons. So he sneaks off the ship but before he gets there he gets one-upped by Disney’s Asian Market 03, who suddenly decides that this is a quest she wants to be on. They go on said quest, which drags the entire film to a halt (because it was apparently not slow enough with the resistance literally just drifting in space) and makes some of the most outrageous claims about rich people ever put to film. Seriously, this is about a half hour of the film and adds nothing to the plot and changes nothing.<br/>Back on the ship, Poe leads a mutiny against Kathleen’s holodeck projections and it feels pretty good to see them go down. But then Leia wakes up and tells the youngin’ to pipe down cause they DO have a plan that they told no one for no reason. But it’s a **** idea, like everything KK does.<br/>Rey is off trying to get Luke to come back and be a Jedi. But Luke is sick of that nonsense and instead goes and milks a giant grey creature with huge **** and then drinks the milk right fresh. A horde of unspeakably annoying bird-groundhogs convince Chewbacca to become vegan. Rey manages to get Luke to tell her to “reach out and feel the Force” in what in a scene that is not terrible. But that’s the end of her training. She shows off how awesome she is with a lightsaber (which she never got trained in) and later kicks Luke’s ass in a duel because this movie hates your intelligence. After a while Rey gets bored of Luke not agreeing with her every whim and decides to leave the planet. Then ghost Yoda shows up as a nearly immobile puppet with worse ghost effects than in ROTJ, and blows up a tree containing the last of the Jedi archives (because this is totally something Force ghosts can do) while telling Luke that Rey doesn’t need to learn anything. Because obviously she’s perfect. Hold on a damn second! Did they just have Yoda say lines that Palpatine said to Anakin? WTF?<br/>During the time that Rey is with Luke, she starts communicating telepathically with Kylo Ren. These conversations are the best part of the film and actually make Kylo a less hateable character. You find out the Luke tried to murder Kylo (because the filmmakers hate Luke apparently) and that’s why he's all genocidal. But Rey has seen the OT and decides that Kylo can be turned back to the light, so she goes to see him. Kylo takes her to Snoke, and then Rey persuades Kylo to kill Snoke. Ending any chance of charactibility or discovery of who the **** Snoke is. Then a bunch of guys in awfulplastic outfits (makes me miss the CGI clones) attack Rey and Kylo and of course Rey is the better fighter and has to save Kylo. But after that Kylo decides he doesn’t want to go back to the light side so Rey leaves the ship and goes to join the rest of the resistance.<br/>The cunning plan of the Granny Gang is to go to a planet right next to the First Order fleet and hope they don’t get destroyed. This plan goes about as well as you’d expect and most of the resistance characters are killed. Then the FO lands their new 2nd-Film-in-the-Series AT-ATs and decides to blast open the resistance hideout. Finn decides to do something useful for once and attempts to suicide himself into the FO cannon but Asian Demographic 03 stops him for no goddamn reason and the FO blows open the door.<br/>Suddenly Luke shows up and challenges Kylo to a duel but PLOT TWIST he’s not really there! He’s just projecting himself across the galaxy because that’s TOTALLY something that is possible now. Kylo throws another tantrum, MaRey-Sue uses more advance Force powers she has no training for, Luke just dies because **** it, and the last tiny group of resistance gets away – but not before announcing they are called Rebels now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

TLJ doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie, but like a Marvel movie with all the forced humour and no plot formula. Disney really ruined the franchise with this one. I am definitely pulled out of the franchise because of TLJ. I understand you wanted to create something different but you don't break the basic important laws/rules of the mythology while doing that. It's just so embarrassing.

Including the prequels, despite the horrendous plot and dialogue. This film really dares me to consider continuing with the franchise anymore. From a plot that could've been avoided if the characters had talked to each other, to the sad portrayal and even slightly immature version of Luke. There is a lot to hate about it yes, but in order for this to be a proper review, I must bring up the good sides of the story. I did enjoy the cinematography on Crait and a very special scene between Luke and an 'Old Friend'.<br/>Overall this film has a lot to fix and JJ is directing the next film so I say 'JJ, You're our only hope'.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The sound and music score were good.<br/>3. The acting was fine given the source material.<br/><br/>Bad things about the movie:<br/>1. Plot inconsistencies, a lot of them.  I can normally go with plot inconsistencies if the flow of the movie makes me not notice them in the moment, but this movie had me going “What! Why?!” in the middle of the movie, and taking away from the movie.<br/>2. A lot of forced humor. Only a few jokes worked for me.<br/>3. No character growth, it seemed liked characters were going to grow, but the movie wastes all the moments and characters end up where they started at the beginning of the film. 4. The pacing was bad. The movie jumps all over the place and feels longer than it should have been.<br/>5. The movie has whole scenes that are basically revealed to have no purpose.  The movie steps on some of its own points.<br/>6. Inconsistency with previous Star Wars movies and specifically the movie directly proceeding it.  The movie disregards all previously established norms of the star wars universe, and also completely rewrites the nature and character of previously established characters.  This would be fine for a reboot, but this was a sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I saw the first Star Wars during its first week.  But I am willing to accept a new vision.  This was not a new vision.  The critics no longer care about nonsensical plotting, a complete lack of character development, any logical consistency, gross violations of the laws of physics or believable dialogue.  I do care about these!  The entire movie is a jumbled mess.  It seems to have been written by a committee of people that have never seen a Star Wars movie or taken a science class or a writing class.  They did the impossible by making space battles tedious and slow-moving.  They drop bombs in space--you know the place where there is no up or down.  People die right and left but no one seems to care.  Instead, they run off on pointless side quests with funny-looking horses and bad rich people at a casino???  And Luke milks an alien....<br/>Incredibly bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

For the last movie I was to see in 2017 “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” I would put it on my yearly list as one of the worst, most boring, one of the needlessly longest movie of the year but I am afraid if I do they would lynch me!<br/><br/>I read a story recently that Star War fans were upset during showings because they thought at one point in the movie the sound had gone out and was going to stop the movie but the director/screenwriter had purposely done it that way. The distributor, Disney, had asked the critics not to give any spoilers but some did so the audience would know this was not a mistake. Folks the scene lasted 2-3 seconds maybe and a big fuss was made about this?<br/><br/>To me the fuss should have been about the length of 2 hours and 30 minutes which could have easily been shortened just by cutting a couple of the aerial dogfights that just basically repeated the same thing over and over.<br/><br/>A fuss should be made about the obviously placed species that you could just hear Disney saying, “We could make millions with this cute creature”!<br/><br/>I know some of the history of the heroes and two of the villains but, unless it was told in another movie or I missed it in this one, why is Rey picked to be the next Jedi, unless it is politically correct to show another strong woman which the series has always had in Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia and now has another in Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo?<br/><br/>Previous stars Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, James Earl Jones, Mark Hamill and the aforementioned Carrie Fisher made strong impressions from their appearance in the first movie but, come on; Adam Driver an inheritor of the Darth Vader role?<br/><br/>I was impressed by Oscar Isaac who has the same throw away style of Ford along with the gravitas the character needs. Kelly Marie Tran stood out as Rose a resistance fighter but I seem to recall John Boyega having, and being, a stronger in the last movie but here he is wasted.<br/><br/>And why oh why does the music have to blast every 5 minutes? To keep the audience awake?<br/><br/>The only good s about “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” was 1) though I thought it would never end it did and 2) it was the first completely free moviepass movie I saw!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I have been a fan of Star Wars for over a decade, and I consider this my second favorite Star Wars movie. Its characters are all fun and interesting, and the storytelling is very exciting. I really liked Mark Hamill's performance of old Luke Skywalker. Some people say that he's too different, but don't listen to them. To me he seemed very much like the old Luke. He changed a bit, yes, but he was still Luke. It's just that a whole lot of time has passed since we last saw him. I think the main problem prevalent in these reviews is how nostalgia is so powerful. It completely blinds people, causing them to absolutely love the old unconditionally, and vehemently hate the new unconditionally, merely because the new is different. It was the same with the prequels. People went into the theater expecting a nostalgia trip, and they didn't get one. So now, they're all upset about how "Disney ruined my childhood" and all that nonsense. Don't listen to them. Please. It was a great movie. Unless you're a picky nerd who's stuck in the past, you'll like it. Rian Johnson did a very good job of picking up where the last film started, and improving on it. The Force Awakens tried to be nostalgic, and look what happened, these same picky fanboys still got all triggered for whatever reason. They're impossible to please. They think they know how to make a movie better than these professional directors and even George Lucas himself. It's arrogant and annoying. No, Rian Johnson didn't ruin Star Wars. Neither did George Lucas, or anyone else. All that happened is that a bunch of nostalgia-driven fanboys ruined the movie for themselves by deciding it was awful before even watching it, and letting nostalgia cloud their memories and perception. Don't let them ruin the movie for you. Go watch it, and enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And after watching The Last Jedi I left the theatre SO DISAPPOINTED, not because of the plot nor the lack of likeness with the comics, but for five reasons: a) The lovely characters from the original trilogy don’t have a strong importance in this movie, also their appearances are VERY LOW /// b) The movie comes with less action sequences and offers more mythology and information of Rey’s past and Jedi stuff, which is not bad but if director Rian Johnson dedicates 1/3 time of the runtime to them it brings boredom /// c) Basically it was expected that this movie could answer so many doubts that episode VII left behind. Sadly, few of them were answered and it brought many more of them. /// d) People die for stupidities!!!<br/>That doesn’t mean the movie was the worst of the franchise, it was still an OK Star Wars experience because of the incredible visual effects, and RIP Carrie Fisher. Also the animals added to the franchise were adorable a 100%!!! It’s just that it could offer WAY MORE than it promised…” (58%)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If you are into capturing the spirit and the fun you had while watching the originals, this one has all of that. If you’ve grown too old and cynical to enjoy them, you may want to move on. Citizen Kane and The Godfather trilogy are all available for download last I checked. Meanwhile, the rest of us will enjoy a very cool Episode 7 and 8. Looking forward to Episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

That is not a celebration of gender and diversity but a crude devaluing of femininity to a fantastical, utopian idealization and white males to power-hungry, fearful mongrels. This is no better than a film which objectifies women.<br/><br/>Luke 1980: "I see good in you!" Luke 2017: "I must purge the evil in you!" He spends years in purgatory (a shamanic/Christ/hero idea) but when he re-emmerges he doesn't lead, challenge, teach (yoda), transcend (Obi-wan), or any of it - he just vanishes after performing the most powerful act yet seen in the universe and not even defeating his darkside counter, but just stalls for the saving of some 40 odd people. A weak symbol of white male irrelevance passing away without the transfer of a mantle. Masculinity, especially caucasian masculinity, is portrayed as wholesale bad, incompetent, or weak in the film. This is the opposite of true diversity and modern diversity interventions. The crux of the hero meaning is that women already encapsulate the fullness of the deeper meaning of religion, and that any pull evil has on her is resolved as just curiosity. She is perfect because well, she just IS. She doesn't require teaching or guidance. That's a false, utopian archetype and a betrayal of both genders.<br/><br/>That's what this film is - a betrayal.<br/><br/>The Hero archetype is only present in Finn, who is on a path to overthrow his former oppressor (this is the only story path which feels correct).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The entire plot is an incoherent mess from start to finish. It's filled with plotholes, inconsistencies and irrational decisions by the characters.<br/><br/>It doesn't just "subverts expectations", it completely goes against all established lore of the Star Wars universe, craps on the characters of the original trilogy and delivers nothing that was built up in The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I didn't like The Force Awakens either, but at the very least, you could appreciate the effort, that was put into "recreating the Original Trilogy magic", when creating that film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it seems like Rian Johnson not only did not see Original Trilogy, but The Force Awakens as well.<br/><br/>No, we didn't have "unreasonable expectations". When J.J. Abrams hyped up the questions, such as "Who are the Rey's parents?", "Who is Snoke?", "Where are the Knights of Ren?", "Why did Luke go into exile?", we rationally expected answers to these questions. We assumed, that they will be answered in the next film of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Disney made an absolutely idiotic decision to switch Directors for each film of the new trilogy, and gave them complete free range of what to do. Unsurprisingly, when Rian Johnson took over, he made his absolute best to destroy everything that J.J. set up.<br/><br/>That was me speaking as a Star Wars fan. For me, as a moviegoer, this movie is just as bad.<br/><br/>It was unnecessary long. The 80% of the movie is a boring chase of two puny fleets, during which the bad guys just shoot at our main characters from time to time.<br/><br/>It is filled with ridiculous humor. From the starting scenes of the movie, with Poe's "yo mama" joke, to the Luke's first scene, where he throws out his father's lightsaber like it's Pirates of the Carribean, the jokes and quips are absolutely out of place.<br/><br/>The side story of Finn and Rose is as boring as it is unnecessary. It takes around third of the movie, and in the end, results in absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>The decisions of the main characters are absolutely stupid. Why didn't Admiral Holdo tell Poe her plan? If it weren't for her, the entire Finn and Rose subplot wouldn't even exist. In the end, she doomed the fleet, because DJ spoiled the Resistance plan, and then she waited for way too long to even do anything about it.<br/><br/>But more importantly, the decisions and portrayal of Luke is disrespectful to the franchise and the fans. From a symbol of hope, the man, who saw light in Darth Vader, second most evil person in the universe, Luke became a bitter old man, who decided to murder hiw own nephew, while he's asleep, just because he had some dark thoughts. And by the end of the film, after a completely anticlimactic final battle between Luke and Kylo, he just decided to die because he was a bit tired.<br/><br/>The only two good parts of the movie are the music and visuals. John Williams' score is as always epic and majestic, which could not even be attributed to this movie, because the pieces are mostly from the previous films. As for the visuals, I didn't expect anything else.<br/><br/>After what I've seen, I'm completely uninterested in the future of Star Wars universe. I refuse to support any future movies, and I'm quite certain, that Rian Johnson either hates Star Wars, or didn't see it at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Tone sometimes is all over the place, the Fin subplot is useless and there a few plot holes here and there that could be easily avoided. But GO and see the movie with open mind and focus on what is doing right. A great fresh deconstruction of the Star Wars story with an interesting theme about failure. When its good its really good.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Many (not all) of the criticisms this movie is getting are completely unreasonable made mostly by fanboys complaining about things that even the original trilogy had, even though the same people consider them a masterpiece. You can like and hate what ever you want but having double standards on your criticisms is a bit hypocritical. I will now get in to spoilers. SPOILERS START HERE>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br/><br/>For example people complain about Snoke being a nobody and we learned nothing about him in the end. Well guess what, the Emperor was no different in the original trilogy. No information was given by the movies. The Emperor was also a pretty one not character that his sole role in the story was to highlight Luke´s and Vader´s internal conflict.  People complain about the movie adding weird things about the force. Which was what the original movies also did. Being able to create force projections makes as much sense as being able to shoot lighting from your fingers or stopping blaster fire with your palms. And in the old movies these things came out-of-nowhere. In the last Jedi it was at least foreshadowed.<br/><br/>People also complain that Luke should never be tempted to kill his pupil and become bitter. The movie takes place 30 years after the original movies and after Luke has failed at almost everything he tried. Of course he is a bitter old man. Everyone would be. As for being tempted to do cruel things. Many times in the past trilogy he was tempted to surrendered to his emotions and almost did. But eventually he held himself under control. Just like here. It make perfect sense for the character.   That is what i mean by inconsistent criticisms. They have more to do with everyone personal expectations than actual objective flaws. And i for one, as a very old Star Wars fan, I enjoyed that a star wars movie subverted my expectations in such an interesting way. Too bad many people are too protective of their little baby of pop culture to appreciate that, liking the movie or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rest assured, "The Last Jedi" is NO "Phantom Menace",  nor has any of the tedious writing or acting of any of the prequels, a fact that should be taken as a relief. Rian Johnson has taken some major risks with the Star Wars universe; we see a jaded, remorseful Luke Skywalker, living like a hermit on a far away planet. Quite the opposite from the optimistic and energetic Luke we last saw in "The Return Of The Jedi". So what happened? First and formost, he got old. Old people tend to be grumpier, right? Add a massive failure in trying to train a nephew who's gone to the dark side and depression will certainly sink in. Luke feels he has let down Leia, Han and his nephew Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) in a major way. Convince this same man that he needs to save the galaxy from the new empire, now called the "First Order" and things will not be easy. What "The Last Jedi" does is to hand down the baton to the next generation of characters in the Star Wars universe. It would be ridiculous to see Star Wars episode 99 and still wanting to see Chewie, Vader, C-3PO and all the characters we so much love. There has to be a continuation. Will I miss my favorite characters? Hell yes, but that's how life is when you lose a dear one. It's not like those Avenger movies where nobdoy dies and they all end up killing and winning over the bad guys. And those movies can get rebooted anyday because that's what comic book heroes are destined to be: and endless parade of reboots. To all those trolls hating "The Last Jedi", what did you expect? A reboot? Weren't you the ones who complained tha "The Force Awakens" was a disguise reboot of "A New Hope"??? And now that you have a different Star Wars episode you complain that it "deviates too much" from the core of Star Wars??? "The Last Jedi" is certainly NOT perfect: some scenes drag on too long in the middle act, the Canto Bight sequences looked borrowed from a Harry Potter movie (even John Williams score during this scenes sounds an awful lot like Harry Potter), some of the humour could've been toned down a bit and I could've done without that Princess Leia sequence trying to be a modern Mary Poppins force user, but in general, it was a great ride of a movie and it still is very much a Star Wars film. John Williams score is far more memorable here than in "The Force Awakens" (where only Rey's and Kylo's themes were the only things that stood out, beside the familiar themes). It's still not as dark as I thought it could be, despite some characters apparently passing away. The award for the darkest and bleakest of all Star Wars movies still goes to "Rogue One". I suggest you give "The Last Jedi" another watch. Star Wars movies are not a "I saw it once" affair to fully grasp everything's that's being thrown at us, information wise. With each viewing, certain things will start making more sense. That is, if you are truly a Star Wars fan, you'll see it more than once, and this humble review is aimed at those fans. Casual or fair weather fans need not to bother.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I have to say that I’m a fan of the original trilogy but except another friend in my group the other two didn’t care about Star Wars very much so they were in just to enjoy a movie together (We are all about 30 years old).  I didn’t have great expectations, I’m not a fan of episode VII, I find it inconsistent and not original but overall I think it’s an ok movie, so I tried to have an open mind for this one. I did know about the mixed reviews but nothing could have prepared me for what I’ve witnessed.  I’m not going to debate the lore or the direction the story is progressing in these new films, I personally don’t like it because for me Star Wars was something else and I think Disney could have told a new original story for the new generations without the need to destroy  the heroes of the old movies and their accomplishments, but , I repeat, this is only my personal  opinion.  ‘The Last Jedi’ was very good visually but story wise it was ridiculous, rushed, full of plot holes and inconsistecies and I’m not saying that in refer to the original trilogy, but to episode VII and even with itself. The characters choices and many scenes are totally random and don’t make any sense. As if this couldn’t be enough the movie is full of cheap forced “funny” moments and evident  political topics that don’t belong in a Star Wars movie at all. We had I think 6 or 7 kids sitting in the row in front of us but I never heard anyone laughing once. I’m completely puzzled about the great reviews this movie is getting. Are good visuals, special effects and cute birds really enough to make a bad movie a great movie?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
