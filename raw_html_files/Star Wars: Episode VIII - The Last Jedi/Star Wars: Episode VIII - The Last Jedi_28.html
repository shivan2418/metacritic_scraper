The movie is a bit too long for the content, which is quite lacking actually, there isn't much story. What story there is is quite convoluted and doesn't flow very naturally. If you loved The Force Awakens, you won't like this one. On the other hand, if you didn't like Episode VII, you'll probably like Episode VIII.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Instead we got a really lazy attempt of the writer to be self-aware and postmodern. The story has no weight and builds up to anti-climactic "jump-surprises" (instead of scares).<br/>It tries to destroy tradition and mythology in a very cynical way and thats why I think many people feel trolled by this movie. Aside from that it also completely seems to ignore the logic of war, politics, science and leadership. I can go on and on, but this movie is weird and bad. And I'm going to stop obsessing over this and move on with my life.

There is no progression from TFA - it’s like it never happened. There are horrible go-and-fetch plots which don’t matter, and the comedy is jarring. Worse of all, it made Luke a frivolous figure.

I do feel I'll need to see it again to take everything in and not watch it while tired, but overall I left the screen quite pleased. Rian Johnson creates a strong and unique work, and while I can see some things annoying some fans but the movie takes bold steps and it mostly works. As far as cast goes, everyone is quite strong. Adam Driver really gets to come into his own as Kylo Ren and Daisy Ridley seems more comfortable as Rey and has some struggles to overcome this time around and it makes her a more compelling hero. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are the best version of Luke and Leia that they've ever been, strong characters worn down by years of struggles, fighting and loss. Oscar Isaac deserves a particular shout out, his Poe Dameron becomes an essential but reluctant leader and he shines as the naive trigger happy star pilot who needs to learn about making the tough call and you can see they realise how he was wasted in 'The Force Awakens'. I won't start stating what I disliked as it may run into spoiler territory and that'd be unfair on anyone who hasn't seen this film yet, but it's more that there was a number of small issues that added up to be annoying rather than one big thing and in the grand scheme of the film, it still comes out looking pretty good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Honestly unsure what film the critics were watching; not the one I saw, apparently. So much effort to show so little happening. I've a feeling I just watched a really long commercial for Battlefront 2 and Disney's only real regret is that they couldn't find a way to charge me halfway through the movie.<br/><br/>Plot development? Virtually none. Plot holes? Many. Character development: Well, Rey did some interesting hiking with Luke, at least. Massive barely-strung-together visual spectacles: Plenty. Some people died along the way, but they got about 30 seconds screen time, so it was hard to tell who they were. I feel sorry for the actors and actresses as they clearly gave their all and in several cases produced stellar performances, but the director and editor threw their hard work into a trash can of mediocrity.<br/><br/>Little in the way of internal consistency, hand-waved deus-ex-machina, topped by practically no explanation - this apparently is what Star Wars is today. Remember how in Empire Strikes Back, the Rebels and the Empire both seemed like functioning militaries with legitimate technology (albeit with different scales of equipment)? Apparently decades later both sides are completely and utterly incompetent. Remember how we had loads of questions in The Force Awakens? Prepare to have none of them answered, along with key characters getting bridges dropped on them to avoid having to answer some of those awkward questions. The posturing men-children of the First Order (complete with orange hair) are back to make us cringe again, and the commanding women of the Rebellion are back to tell us to keep calm and trust them without any explanation whatsoever. This seems oddly familiar ground... The heroes and villains are done huge disservices by being shoehorned into outcomes that make no sense. Sprinkle some forced humour and a couple of bits of Force 'magic' that trample all that made the original films great, and that about wraps it up.<br/><br/>The excellent showing by Hamill and Ridley as retired Jedi master and aspiring Jedi trainee is intermixed with set piece silliness after set piece silliness in the wider movie. Almost every aspect of the battles make no sense and are just there to provide convenient holes for the paper-thin plot to run into. As an aside, Rogue One did a far better job here; the combat in that movie seemed seriously grounded compared to this outing. From hundreds of stormtroopers vanishing to scenes that go nowhere (I honestly lost track of the number of times the film introduced concepts & characters then promptly forgot about them) to strange attention-seeking moments where the film pauses as if to say 'here, we're making a point here' - the pacing and editing are remarkably poor.<br/><br/>Throw in a good bit of political commentary, because where would Hollywood be without lecturing us poor plebeians, and really, I found TLJ thoroughly disappointing. Fun if you have a short attention span and want to go 'oohh ahh' at all the pretty stuff, but the central and fairly cerebral theme of Star Wars that Lucas built, of Light and Dark and the points of view between, appears to have been force-pushed out the nearest airlock.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A bit too long even for a bad movie with a couple of interesting scenes. Is it flawed? Terribly so. This movie is awful, and should've NEVER been made. Forget the charm of the original trilogy: the Last Jedi follows the MARVEL flick formula of throwing in supposedly funny jokes and gags every 5-10 scenes. There's a lot of techno-babble filler talking, a lot of poorly developed characters you won't care about, a lot of bad BAD dialogue in general. I don't like it, to say the least. In fact, after they're done with this, I fully expect a reboot (just as awful).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The way this production attacks everything we know and love about Star Wars, the disrespect, the impudence... Simply unbearable. The Last Jedi literally mocks with the previous films and with the audience who were expecting answers regarding some unanswered questions that arised in Ep.7. Disney and producers first create those questions, make the audience wonder about them, discuss them for 2 years and then WHAM! Now they are the most unimportant issue in the whole universe. Not even worth talking about in the movie. Not even worth to shoot a scene just to provide some depth and answers. Why? Oh right, to create surprise and excitement! The final point I'll be making is about what Star Wars is and is not.<br/>Star Wars is NOT just a simple series of films. There are hundreds of books which cover a time span of millions of years in this created SW universe. SW has a lore. SW has a tone. It has some rules even though they are not written. And whoever tries to create a literature / game / film etc. in this universe has to respect them.<br/><br/>Disney erased the whole canon when they bought the franchise, leaving only some of the animation series and the first 6 films intact. I thought they were going to create their own version of the past and future of the saga. I thought they were simply trying to make some room for themselves to maneuver in. Now I see that they never respected any of it otherwise they would not ask us to "burn the past".<br/><br/>I will not go and watch the SW ep.9 in the theater; neither will I watch any Disney movie in theaters and I will never watch a movie of this terrible director Johnson, Jameson whatnot unless the Disney board comes up with an official apology.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Im going to list a couple of things that annoyed me:<br/>-How come the other stardestroyers don't fire at the fleeing rebel fleet at all, they seem utterly useless. The first order looks like a bunch of amateuers just flying behind the rebels, waiting for their fuel to finish. Strategy is obsolete.<br/>-projectiles/lasers fly ballistically in space when shooting the transporters. Theres not even a star or an anomaly that affects the shot gravitationally.<br/>-Rey can resist the lightsaber force pull as well as Kylo? She hasn't trained and she's still new to the force. Kylo is a well trained Sith that can even freeze people and blasters in time. -can apparently forcelift bigtime. Without any training, she's able to do something even Luke with Yoda as his trainer wasn't able to do initially. All he lifted was R2D2 and a rock in E5. -can apparently shoot down tie fighters in the millennium falcon better than Han Solo and Luke Skywalker together, even though it was Han's ship and despite him being one of the best gunslingers and roguepilots in the galaxy. (they had trouble getting rid of a couple of tie fighters in E4, whereas Rey singlehandedly just shoots down a bunch of them)<br/>- She fights several guardians of Snoke, that even the unhurt and much better trained Kylo had trouble defeating.<br/>This is exactly what I mean when a genre is not true to itself.<br/>- Finn is almost completely useless to the main plot. His plans didn't succeed, he's a running coward that only when he almost managed to clear his bad honor got spared by his chubby asian friend. -How come the two of them survived the exploding/burning hangar, while everything in there was dead.<br/>-force using Leia is about the worst I've seen in the movie. Everyone that is slightly force sensitive can apparently master it. Even the kid with its broom at the end. Even Anakin Skywalker wasn't able to do this under much more intense pod racing situations.<br/>-Everyone that feels the force is apparently able to talk to each other. Leia, Kylo, Rey, Luke, Yoda. How come they never used that skill during the clonewars or during similar intense situations? All Luke and Vader were able to do was noticing their presence. But not across half the galaxy.<br/>-What happened to yoda? Did he show Luke how to do it? It wasn't explained. Obviously Luke found a way to materialize a mental clone engaging in a Lightsaber fight halfway across the galaxy-spending all his energy and dying.<br/>-Most unexplained and ridiculous of all was the destruction of Snokes main ship. How come a simple command ship of the rebels can just hyperspace charge at another ship, destroying half of the fleet? Isn't that what shields are made for? How come it hasn't come to anybody's mind doing the same trick before? It seems awfully effective.<br/>-One fighter can take out almost all the turrets on a superstardestroyer? How come he could sneak through the shields or he could even get that close? How come the other stardestroyers didn't jump in or attack the rebels commando ship?<br/>-AtAts didn't really fire at all. Just watching the scene with Luke a couple of minutes later, they could've easily spent that firepower either on the gliders or on the trenches. Useless.<br/>-Killing Snoke seemed awkwardly easy<br/>-Why is there so much focus on the Porgs? Its a new designed Alien that everyone apparently things as cute. But measured by the amount and factor of appearance, not contributing anything useful to the story, they are just useless. Even Ewoks or JarJar had more to contribute to the plot. One can definitely see that they have been designed for one purpose - to raise merchandise.<br/>- Countless "funny" jokes kill the atmosphere. After all, it is Star Wars, not Marvel. Marvel lives of that comedy. Star Wars had a macho rogue smuggler that was acted by Harrison Ford. Of course he makes some fun macho quotes. But not everybody. All the time. Facing death. Not even sarcastic but stupid. Completely killed the atmosphere for me there Disney.<br/><br/>It feels like thrown into some ADHD kids mind. Super short mainplot with a couple of useless sideplots, action ALL the time to not get bored by story. Star Wars used to live a bit of intergalactic politics as well. And even if Disney hasn't really adapted the expanded universe, has much to offer. And potential. Not anymore.<br/>Couldn't care less if Finn or Rey or Leia or Poe died the next movie. Its about time. The true hero in this movie with at least a little bit of character depth is Kylo Ren. Critics just gave this movie a good rating because they wanted to be invited to the next premiere.For now, Episode 8 not only made Episode 7 look bad again -as there doesn't seem a big idea where the Star Wars universe is supposed to go-, it almost killed Star Wars. At least for me. And I'm hooked since the first minute. It's an action movie with some lightsabers and some forcesensitive people. But no real Star Wars</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A space opera that is singularly the worst drivel to ever be used as a continuation of an epic story like Star Wars. The need to place emphasis on characters that have NO background or proper story arc is beyond comprehension. Yes the midichlorians from Episode 1 are a joke but what has been done to the gaping plot holes in the last two films (not including Rogue One) is a travesty. Snoke? Dead...no explanation as to who or what he was. Luke? A broken shell of a man who never redeems himself (in terms of the character). Kylo and Rey? WHO CARES...... Thanks disney youve destroyed my childhood. I saw a copy of Episode 4 in a store the other day and got a stomach ache....

It did. But the ground it treads is of a very dark path. Not story wise, but film-making wise. Let me explain. This movie is a corporate statement from the creators, that reads:<br/><br/>----.<br/><br/>From now on:.<br/><br/>- Instead of providing answers to previously set up questions, we will simply subvert, dazzle and destroy.<br/><br/>- Instead of setting up insteresting story arcs, we will provide shock value and fan service.<br/><br/>- Instead of avoiding plot holes, we will simply have characters acknowledging them and laughing at them.<br/><br/>- Instead of showing the drama involved with galaxy spanning destruction, we will have characters simply mention key plot points.<br/><br/>- Instead of establishing meaningful locations and characters with purpose, we will find technobabble-ladden excuses for nice trailer visuals.<br/><br/>- Any interesting characters will only be developed in licensed games and books.<br/><br/>---.<br/><br/>This movie marks an era where the story is just an excuse for nice trailer visuals, where continuity errors are solved with one-liners and where everything revolves around selling toys. In this light - I never thought I'd say this - The Last Jedi makes the prequels feel like great storytelling. At least The Phantom Menace had purpose. At least The Attack of the Clones had long story arcs and held the trilogy together. What a sad development for the franchise and film-making in general.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The casino subplot was a bit long though.<br/>I really loved Luke Skywalker as well as Rey and Kylo Ren, good acting that makes me wonder what we will see in Episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Everything else is a tonally  confused, misguided mess. Lazily exposited 'moral of the day' a la every Disney movie ever. It trades in anticlimax as though that is cleverer than climax; in actuality it's just less satisfying.<br/><br/>New characters are largely bland and uninteresting, with performances worse than in the previous film. Mark Hamill puts in a good shift with a highly questionable storyline. John Williams puts out, unfortunately, his most uninspired score yet, with literally no new pieces worthy of listening to. Certainly closer to the prequels than the OT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Troublesome powers that also render a scene waaay less dramatic (an non-existent lightsabre duel! COOL!). Dull characters I have no interest in watching 'develop'.

Not only that it kills off important characters like it was nothing, hey wanna know about Snoke? well too bad, it was too much work so we'll just kill him off, oh but Phasma must be an interesting character right, she could put up a fight right? nope, gets killed off just as fast as a 12 year watching porn would climax.<br/><br/>Well atleast the story might be good you ask? once again not really,fights are drawn out so much and not very interesting at all to say the least. What strikes me a lot is how well Rey fought against THE EMPIRIAL **** GAURDS TOO **** WELL, are you **** me, the most highly trained guards in the galaxy gets killed off by a little girl with no prior experience in combat that trained against a **** boulder... really?! oh yeah and Finn should be dead atleast 2 times in this movie, no way miss asian woman could have saved him the in front of that canon.<br/><br/>and oh the plotholes in this movie... i could write a lot about this movie and how much of a disapointment it is to me, but i simply don't have the energy for me to rant on. Rian Johnson you have failed and ruined Star Wars forever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I had been looking forward to discovering at least SOME of the secrets from the Force Awakens.  But alas, it wasn't to be.  Rian Johnson just brushed away everything that had come before so he could do what he wanted, rather than what the fans wanted and expected.  He was completely the wrong choice for this movie.  It seems he's tried to create art-house Star Wars and filled the movie with a few flashy colour schemes, some nonsensical and pointless plots (half the film was spent not advancing the story at all).  I never thought I would utter these words, but honestly - "The Prequels" were better.  Yeah, The Last Jedi is that bad.  At least the Prequels kept some feeling of Star Wars in them.  The Last Jedi is devoid of that life, it is dark and dreary and dull.  I hope Abrams can pull the series back with Episode IX.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It didn't blow my mind, and I think it has a balance between good and bad things, just like the Force. I like this new approach it makes with it (the Force), which I think builds a track for future SW movies. Almost all my questions from The Force awakens have been answered, and I'm glad for that, but I feel the film is TOO LONG, and there are TOO MANY characters, just like in the Avengers movies, and some of them are disappointing as a result. Despite the action scenes are great, in the first place I feel like there are plotlines that are unnecessary and only make the movie longer, but i'll wait and see how it translates in the third movie. I have also missed some more lightsaber battles, which I hope reappear in episode IX, and a better character developement and death selection. It raises new questions for the last movie of the trilogy and I can't wait to watch it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Like many I think there were definitive plot holes, but I was more disappointed because this could have been overcome, given the excellent acting, with just a few tweaks of the story, and at least one decent lightsaber battle.  I also felt the ending was horribly anticlimactic for a 2nd in line star wars movie, and there were so many ways they could have added 1 or 2 in to make things actually interesting and anticipatory for the final movie.  I just don’t know where they go from here, other than the painfully obvious final battle b/w a certain young Jedi and Sith.  But what was probably most frustrating for me was how the Finn character was treated.  After a great character set-up/arc in Force Awakens, he had absolutely zero development/build, including going nowhere with what appeared to be the makings of another Jedi as a counter to Rey.  I mean Jesus they opened this series in Force Awakens, with HIS awakening in the force, then went nowhere with it in Last Jedi.  His exploits with Rose ultimately and frustratingly prove completely pointless.  I’m just frustrated that what appeared to be a co-lead in the series with Rey, and thus a first diverse lead in Star Wars, was turned into a bit part character.  Don’t know if this is part of the Hollywood diversity problem in general, as directors (writers notwithstanding) who have these controls, have been the ones to push the White characters into position to ultimately save the day, with the diverse characters playing the joking/helper side-kick type parts.  Even Poe was given hero status in a few different ways, as opposed to Finn who failed twice to do what he attempted in trying to save the “resistance”.  Given the change in directors I wonder if that was the issue, and if maybe Abrams can bring some of the magic back to this once promising character, and overall series arc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Firstly, as mentioned on every single review - the middle part drags, resulting in a heavily bloated runtime. The Finn sideplot was not only my least favourite part of the movie, but ultimately absolutely pointless. I don't mind a bit of a bait and switch - but it was just such a redundant part of the movie. There was plenty of other ways of helping his character arc develop.<br/><br/>Next up - Luke - hes thoroughly dislikable in the movie. Luke may be a broken man, but he was never a dick. Some of the new powers that certain characters developed were also daft - reminded me of R2D2 being able to fly all of a sudden in the prequels.<br/><br/>There are some really good action set pieces, but overall I far preferred Force Awakens - it was more of a pure Star Wars movie to me. This one felt like an imposter. I really had high hopes for this. Will give it another go - but as far as I'm concerned, Star Wars 1-9 is the Skywalker saga. Hard to see that playing out the way I'd like in Ep9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The remainder of the production - acting, music, VFX and direction, were all excellent - but as a narrative it was a pitiable disaster. The worst of all possible outcomes for a movie audience is to end up not caring about the characters, and that is where this travesty of a film led me.

As you would expect, it is full of throw backs, fan nods and thankfully more original story telling.<br/><br/>In one hand, it is a maturing of the characters in the Star Wars universe, combining years of wisdom from those that have been part of the struggle for so long, mixed with fresh naiveity and creativity from those just getting started.<br/><br/>This is a new movie and with it, a fresh approach. If you are expecting a rehash of the same tried and tested formula gone before you may be unhappy with the direction. However, the new approach combining the seriousness of a moment with increased slap stick humor, although strange at first, is something I very much welcome and feel gives this movie it's own sense of identity. Something Star Wars movies gone before have sometimes struggled to accomplish.<br/><br/>The movie has it's plot twists, which are something more reminiscent of Episode IV. Your mind will be gently working throughout the movie to understand the actions of some of the characters and will keep you guessing right to the end.<br/><br/>However it is not without it's cringe worthy moments, some of which certainly require further explanation in order for it to become palatable.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie is a brilliant half-way point in the trilogy and answers enough questions as it proposes. Episode VIII is well placed to become another movie that can be treasured in the Star Wars universe for years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There's some more force powers nonsense, but it's a fantasy movie, so space magic is understandable.  Mysteries are left unsolved, but they might come up later (characters can lie), or maybe be revealed in the comics (reading comics won't hurt you).  There was more humor than I expected, but that's not a bad thing.  Lots of surprises to be had as well.  I'm not sure why people expect so much from a movie, that so many are angry.  It was a very fun use of almost 3 hours.  Don't expect it to fix your life's problems, though.  Still sad and alone  (but that's not Mark Hamill's job to fix).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Well, as for now, I hope the last installment of this trilogy (episode XII) can completely cover this problem once and for all, and please, DON'T SCREW EPISODE XII!!!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And maybe it was because of high expectations, fueled by rave revievs, but after the screening I was very dissapointed with The Last Jedi. Few "interesting" twists, like 3 (genuinely) funny moments, beautiful visuals. Apart from that - uneven story, parody of the SW universe, facepalm after a facepalm. Maybe it is a movie for 7 year olds? I guess I am not the target audience anymore. It is painful to say but I am not invested in these characters and almost don't look forward to their future adventures at all. I wish it wasn't this way, it is Star Wars after all... Oh well, I am sad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

JJ Abrams left the continuity of the Star Wars timeline in complete shambles with his slap-dash Episode 7 two years ago. He didn't take a single bit of time to develop characters. In a trilogy, we should have already established primary characters like Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo Ren. But they were just thrown at us in a typical JJ Abrams Generic Sci-Fi Action Flick. Rian Johnson was handed this collection of shattered pieces and was expected to make it all work.<br/><br/>Honestly, despite some of the user reviews here, I have no problems with Johnson's work. He did the best with what he was handed. Johnson didn't destroy any original characters' legacies, that was already done back in Episode 7. Luke's legacy and the entire events of the Original Trilogy were summarily tossed aside to give us Empire and Rebels 2.0. Because so many new characters were introduced in Episode 7 (and 8), and so many plot threads left completely unanswered, it would have been impossible for ANY writer/director to manage them. The portrayal of the Finn and Poe as bumbling idiots works in the structure of a trilogy IF their characters are fleshed out in the prior installment. Again, because no real effort was made in the previous movie, the structure for these characters in this movie comes across as hackneyed.<br/><br/>Johnson made a very admirable attempt to salvage something from the mess. Without going into spoilers, there were some genuine moments of fun and some good nostalgic feels. But there were a lot more "What?", "Wait, but didn't they just... nevermind.", and "What purpose does Laura Dern's character even serve?" moments. It's clear that, with exception to Rogue One, Star Wars died with Episode 7. Since Episode 7 serves as the foundation for the rest of the trilogy and that foundation is flawed, nothing will save this trainwreck of a trilogy. "Star Wars" has become little more than a Disney cash cow. The movie equivalent of pumping out awful annual Call of Duty video game installments. I predicted two years ago that people would, by Episode 8, be looking back at Episode 7 and realizing they'd rather have the Lucas prequels again. Lo and behold! Looking at these reviews, looks like I was right.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm a huge fan of SW in general and nothing will probably ever beat the original trilogy but I support the franchise reinventing itself to a certain degree. This movie is unpredictable, exciting, visually stunning, original and clever. The humor is a 50/50 hit/miss for me - some of it feels forced, some of it is perfect.<br/><br/>There's a lot of backlash and hate going around atm; I can understand people scratching their heads at some of the events and twists in the movie and I also have unanswered questions, however, the level of vitriol is simply not justified. If you're giving the movie a rating of 0/10 and saying it's the worst movie ever then you're clearly having an irrational emotional tantrum like Kylo Ren - search your feelings, you know it to be true.<br/><br/>It's brave new world for Star Wars and I'm excited to see what happens in ep IX.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As an avid fan, and a writer, I have spent many years thinking about what I have wanted from Star Wars, and what I would do were I ever given the chance to take the helm. TLJ went about as far from my idealized version of Star Wars as possible, and yet I could not be more pleased about that. You can’t experience the joy of discovery and surprise, if you receive what you were expecting.<br/><br/>After the sugar-coated suppository that was The Force Awakens, Disney has finally taken the Star Wars saga in a bold new direction, where the struggle of good vs evil has been skewed more toward a realm of grey. Rather than the done-to-death formula of J.J. Abrams' entry in the series, Rian Johnson has delivered a complex and emotionally-saturated work of art, that makes the audience work to find the meaning behind each scene, rather than spoon-feeding it to them as though they are toddlers. Some of the greatest decisions Johnson has made are sure to infuriate rabid fans, but in time it will become clear that the direction he chose to take these characters and storylines was ultimately best for the series.<br/><br/>While shy of a masterpiece, this film does an admirable job of trying to please the three target demographics (Children, adult fans who have grown up with Star Wars, and adult fans who have wanted Star Wars to grow up alongside them). This is accomplished largely by creating a subplot to appeal to each group, be it Finn's wacky, child-friendly adventure, the truly space operatic struggle of the Resistance, and the complex and ever-shifting relationship between Rey, Kylo, and Luke. While this does not always work, and at times the tone of the film feels truly all over the place, it is a worthy trade-off to see the franchise grow beyond its roots, and strive to be more than just a repeat of what has come before.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that this movie is greatly enhanced by multiple viewings. Not only does it help to strip away the viewer's preconceptions (which is the biggest hurdle TLJ must face), it also allows one to pick up on the carefully-woven threads of story that were place so expertly and subtly, that they are almost impossible to see the first time around.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Last Jedi is a flawed, but ultimately rich and rewarding experience, for those that are willing to accept that the movie they created in their mind was never going to be the movie that ended up on the screen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Most of the characters acted like children, out of character, and their actions made little sense. Awkward humor every minute, and the whole movie is based around the First Orders elite star destroyers puttering after a single rebel space bus waiting 18 hours for it to run out of gas. And yet Finn and crybaby Rose can take a small ship on a side quest to a planet light years away and come back to the puttering chase. Absolutely ridiculous logical fallacy.

We do not need a Reboot or reinvention of lore. We barely have tolerated the elimination of the EU. Remember that George Lucas has kept the continuation of the Saga from us since RoJ (and no, the prequel cr@p does not count) so of course we have expectations!<br/><br/>We want to watch your films over and over with friends and family. We want to spend money on merchandise and more. We want to support you but you must give us what we want. JJ created a decent start with TFA. To ignore that is a huge failure on your part.<br/>We want to see Jedi Master Luke. We want to see Rey have an important background. We want to see Phasma be the Boba Fett of the series. We want an EPIC clash between the Resistance and the First Order. We want Snoke to mean something. Let Kylo Ren be the most conflicted bad guy in history. Give us character definitions we deserve for Finn, Poe, Hux, Rose, and more. Majority of the 7 and below reviews are incredibly accurate.<br/>There were plenty of discussions, rants, videos, theories, art, for 2 yrs by the fan base. It is insulting that you took none of it seriously and failed to understand just about everything we said.<br/>We can accept change. We did with most of TFA. Rogue One blew us away. Prequels gave us Maul and Qui-Gon, Mace, and definition to Obi-Wan. Do not give us half baked attempts at “story telling” and tell us it was all by design. I read in several interviews now that Rian Johnson consulted every part with Disney brass to make the movie that was released and that is simply unacceptable. How so many bad decisions of poor storytelling, poor editing, and poor character development could make it into the final release screams of brand mismanagement.  Indy and Trek suffer from this same fate. Marvel is well on its way.<br/><br/>THIS is why we are upset, Disney. Take notice and fix it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm still fresh on this but maybe my favourite Star wars film so far - though the original trilogy have the near impossible to beat nostalgia value in their favour this film really does a good job in avoiding cliches (with the exception of one part that remains my only complaint).<br/><br/>9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7876434"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">As an avid fan of Star Wars since 1999, when my father carried me into the cinema to watch Episode I with just 1 year, I can't express how difficult is for me to dislike an Star Wars film. I really went to see it with high expectations for what I saw at the trailers, but the film was nothing like it... As good as the movie looks, they wasted Mark Hamill's time and that should be punished.<br/><br/>I've already seen it and can guarantee that I wont be rewatching this one. Doesn't have the same rewatch value as The Force Awakens (TFA).<br/><br/>As a movie, this rating should be at about 0.5 - 1 because it completely takes a dump on everything the Original Trilogy (and to some extent the Prequels) set up. While TFA introduced the fact that the ending of Return of the Jedi meant nothing of consequence because the Rebels and the Empire are still around with the same power dynamics (pretty much), this movie further solidifies that nothing that came before it matters. <br/><br/>Luke's scene at the end of TFA is essentially the start of a strip-tease and The Last Jedi is a continuation of that strip-tease with absolutely no payoff. His role in the movie starts with him taking Anakin's lightsaber from Rey and casually throwing it behind him like a can of soda or litter... His father's lightsaber, the lightsaber he first used, the lightsaber he lost his hand with in his first lightsaber duel with his father the moment he learned his true heritage, the first lightsaber ever seen on screen is tossed aside with little thought. It seemed to me, a metaphor for Disney throwing away what came before in favor of new-ness they can completely control and tailor to the focus-group formulas, and this scene should set your expectations for this movie.<br/><br/>Snoke's character amounts to little more than a bait-and-switch and is killed perhaps just past the midpoint of the movie. He narrates his own death foolishly, and I've seen some people calling it poetic but I think it's lazy. We get no back story for the character that was often described as "more powerful than Palpatine" and "ancient" and then he is killed. How they could have made it better is by NOT showing Kylo moving the lightsaber next to Snoke with the Force. The audience isn't stupid, we would be able to piece together that betrayal and it would make it more shocking. We learn Rey's backstory. She is a nobody from Jakku, her parents sold her for drinking money and, if I remember correctly, they are said to be dead. So for the last two years hundreds of YouTube channels, blogs and articles and thousands upon thousands of fans, new and old alike, have been speculating about the two biggest mysteries of the new Star Wars films, Rey and Snoke, only to have the rug pulled out from under them in pretty weak reveals that Rey is a nobody and Snoke is also, a nobody.<br/><br/>Disney broke the Force as we knew it by having Rey completely know how to use random Force powers as the plot demanded such as Jedi mind trick and Kylo Ren's mind reading trick (and for those that defended this as maybe she was one of Luke's students, The Last Jedi all but confirms she is literally just a nobody who never had any sort of training in her youth)<br/><br/>Leia's ship's bridge is blown to smithereens by TIE fighters. This is what kills Admiral Ackbar in the background and Leia is flung into the cold embrace of space. This honestly would have been a good death for the character. It respects her as a frontline fighter, general and leader to the end willing to sacrifice her life for her cause just as quickly as anyone else. But, nope! Instead we get a terrible scene of her FLYING back to the ruined bridge. If you haven't noticed the lack of Finn, Poe and Rose in this review, then you're doing fine. Everything they do is pretty lackluster. Probably the biggest spoiler is that Luke goes out like a punk. He does very little other than play the unwilling and hard-headed mentor. The movie depicts him as a crotchety old man who was willing to murder a child (Ben) because of the potential evil in the child (I guess child-murder runs in the family). <br/>When he finally gets his will to fight and you think that he will be the bamf we expect him to be, it turns out he couldn't even bother to show up. For the whole movie, he does not leave the island.  His death scene is honestly really well shot with the sunsets but it's so undeserved. Fans have been waiting since 1980s, over 30 years to see Luke again on the big screen and there's a certain expectation for what Luke should be able to do. For Luke to go out like this means we will (probably) never see Mark Hamill go all out. What was shown here was not even a fraction of how powerful he was. Because he fades away, Disney easily has an out to say "Oh, we didn't actually kill him! Star Wars isn't for the people it used to be for. This transition from passion Star Wars to a more "general audience" friendly. I'm so sorry for writing this down, but it's the truth. Come back, George...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Also his "she's not what I expected"- he **** serves under Princess Leia, Poe knows powerful women, don't project your misogyny onto good characters, Rian.<br/>- Finn. Jesus, he was shafted so goddamn hard. His and Rose's plot line did absolutely nothing to drive the plot anywhere- such a waste of time. There was so much potential to explore about Finn and they chose to do nothing with him. - I will never forgive Rian for the rest of my life for making me watch Luke Skywalker stare dead eyed in the face at Rey as he drinks green sea cow **** juice.<br/>- Luke has some okay scenes and the Crait scene was epic, and I cried at Luke and Leia's reunion. But I **** hated the way they explained away the fallout with Luke/Kylo. If Luke felt a moment of hatred flow through him, fine, that somewhat makes sense for him. However, the narrative doesn't frame it like that; rather it's done to shown Kylo as being sympathetic and rationalizing his attack. I don't think I'm explaining this right, but Luke's actions serve Kylo's character more than they serve Luke, and that really bothered me. Luke deserved more than that.<br/>-Rey. Goddamn they **** Rey so badly in this film it honestly makes me so sad. She's the first female jedi protagonist and a plot that was supposed to be her finding her balance and place in the force became this redemption mission for a man she spoke to 3 times. What was supposed to be HER conflict with light and dark became Kylo's; she was just roped into his conflict without being given one of her own.<br/>God they just let down Rey so hard in this, but they did that to a lot of characters.<br/>-as a lifelong Star Wars fan, the "resolution" of killing<br/>Snoke was the biggest **** YOU to fans who spent years waiting for an expansion of SW lore. Who is he? Where is he from? How is he connected? Now it's nothing. And this leads me to wonder: of Kylo is the driving force for all of the darkness in the galaxy, how is redemption? How<br/>Is it even possible? The Emperor worked because he was this pillar that had to be toppled in the OT. Now it's Kylo? I personally think this movie showed Kylo to be too far gone and irredeemable, but I feel like they're still trying to make him sympathetic. I'm just so lost as to where the conflict is and who the villain is.<br/>But yeah I felt like all of the harder potential from the first was lost in space with this one. Biggest disappointment of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are very few horrible parts to this movie, aside from the plethora of plot-holes, the inconsistent tone, and that horrible Leia in space scene.  In fact, there are some very good scenes (Rey and Kylo Ren vs the guards, one of the best melee fights in the series).  However, at almost every turn, the movie seems to take the underwhelming option, almost getting things right, but missing almost every single time.  A movie can do that many times, but when it does that, start to finish, it really falls apart.  I came out of the theater thinking that too many consider 'subverting expectations' to be the same as 'making a good movie.'<br/><br/>First, the plot that the movie is built around is the Rebel fleet fleeing the First Order fleet, which can track them through hyperspace.  They don't have enough fuel to outrun the FO fleet (pretty sure this is the first time that anyone has mentioned fuel constraints in Star Wars, that bugged me) for long.  There's so many plot holes here that have been rehashed over and over and over by others (mainly, why didn't the FO just call in reinforcements ahead of the rebels), so I'll just offer what I hope is something unique: This plot has already been done before in scifi, and one of the best examples is the 2000s Battlestar Galactica's very first episode, '33.'  RJ would have done well to draw inspiration from that.<br/><br/>Second, the subplot of Rose and Finn crashing the set of the Fifth Element... I honestly have nothing new to say about this that I haven't read in a hundred other reviews (including that joke, which I could not resist rehashing).  Also, apparently, horse racing is evil.<br/><br/>Third, the plot of Rey's training was so bare bones, when it could have been the centerpiece of the whole movie.  I challenge you to find me anyone that would not have watched two and a half hours of Luke training Rey.  When he finally agrees to give her some training, he tells her he'll give three lessons.  Movie, why say there are three lessons when we only get to see two?  And, of the two, one of them was him talking about how horrible the Jedi are (thats not a lesson, thats just venting).  She gets no training, other than how to reach out and touch the Force.  In other words, she gets to take the easy, quick way, to Force mastery, also known as the Dark Side (which the movie starts to set us up for, with Luke amazed at her innate connection to the Dark Side, and then abandons, just like his third lesson).<br/><br/>Mark Hamill's best performance as Luke was wasted here, which is a complete shame.  They could have done the 'Luke in exile' plot so much better, rather than him being jaded and wanting to die.  Why not have him have a crisis of confidence in himself, rather than the Jedi, after his failure with Kylo Ren?  He feels guilt for letting his students down, thinking that he shouldn't have tried to train the new generation of Jedi, since his own training was rushed and incomplete.  He goes into exile to study most ancient of Jedi texts so that he can rise to the occasion and properly redeem himself, but, in his exile, he's so cut off from everyone else that he doesn't recognize what progress he's made as a teacher.  Rey's arrival snaps him out of his funk, and he realizes that his failures as a teacher were part of his own education, and he properly trains her.  See what I mean about the movie constantly almost getting it right?  What I wrote right there?  That makes so much more sense and feels more right than what we got, and it really isn't all that different from what we got on screen.<br/><br/>Finally, the decision to kill Snoke was bold, and could have worked... if Kylo Ren were more frightening.  But, he's too easy to outfox - he's like a rabid dog, attacking whatever is in front of him (remember the scene in TFA where the Storm troopers just turn around when they see he's pissed off? There's the rebel strategy, from here on out).<br/><br/>I could go on, but then, I'd be writing my own version of The Last Jedi, instead of a critical review, so I'll end with things I liked about it (I can still like parts even while giving it a 0): Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, and Benicio Del Toro gave very compelling performances.  The porgs were perfectly balanced between cute funny and annoying funny.  The humor was not terrible, though the visual gags were better than the actual jokes.  The visuals were very cool; my favorite (though the movie does almost nothing with it; again, with the 'almost getting it right') was Rey in the Dark Side mirror cave.  I'd rate Holdo's hyperspace kamikaze maneuver higher if it weren't for the fact that it raises the twin questions of 'why isn't that a common strategy?' (with automated ships, of course) and 'why don't ships have counters to that?'<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd like to think that my objections to the film are based on its artistic merits, rather than its failure to adhere to some sense of 'what Star Wars is/is not.'</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I really couldn't tell where it was going, and that was amazingly refreshing for a Star Wars film. Granted, it wasn't perfect. Some of the writing felt clunky (but really, clunky writing is as much a part of Star Wars as lightsabers?) some of the jokes were great, others felt forced. It felt like the film was overstuffed, too many characters, too many sub plots. The Last Jedi would have been a stellar eight episode tv series, too bad. But still awesome. Loved where they took Luke, loved everything from the island (especially that last bit with the fire). But more than anything, I love that fascists hate this movie. It makes me love this movie SO much more. I'm giving it an extra point just for this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Los que critican en mala STAR WARS Episodio 8 TLJ son unos frikis virgenes eyaculadores precoces, con elevada preferencia temporal, son de esos saco weas que Nintendo o  Microsoft se los viola todos los años vendiendoles la misma mierda de hace 30 años y los weones compran 100 veces todos los aparatos y juegos todos los años.    2.Los otros Haters son posers, como la película les exploto la cabeza y no tienen noción del universo SW y creen que es la historia de los Skywalker y sus amigos, se sienten decepcionados y dicen "esto no es Star Wars" "Hay pocas batallas con espada láser" "echaron por suelo la lucha del bien contra el mal, la luz y la oscuridad" "Como los villanos pueden ser tan tontos y morir tan fácil", mira poser de mierda hay un montón de novelas en el universo extendido, en una Vader lucha contra animalejos y al vencerlos se hace su líder (historia posterior a la destrucción de la primera estrella de la muerte), historias incluso de personajes terciarios, cuaternarios, incluso que ni conoces con su tinta propia, como dice el prologo "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away". Es SABLE DE LUZ y pues dime que en la Trilogía original viste mas de 1 pelea por película o de calidad, si lo que buscas es acción no critiques esta película en base a la trilogía original. ¡Ay! amigo te falta conocer la fuerza, leer sobre los primeros Jedi, mas sobre Maice Windu o a Yoda escuchar con mas atención debes. Como en el punto uno, queda una película no  seas impaciente, la trama se ha mostrado mas compleja, eso puede resultar bien o mal, los malos también se equivocan o como dice el mensaje de la película "los buenos o los malos, solo depende del punto de vista".</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I’m a SW fan since childhood and actually loved Force Awakens and saw it many times in theater.  That movie walked the line between nostalgia and new, but this one seems unconcerned with both.  This feels like a reboot of a reboot where they are trying to wipe the chessboard clean and establish some episodic rhythm (as in TV show) instead of what we thought would be a new trilogy with beginning middle and end.  Where’s the epic?  Where’s the vision?  The cinematography was even bland.  I was completely  unimpressed with the story..... I could go on and on.  I always aim to be respectful of other artist’s vision, but this is Star Wars here, if you’re going to buy it for 4 billion dollars I want you to try harder on this story, these movies have the power to inspire a billion people and we deserved a lot better on this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Abrams and he shows it, even though there's not a very obvious change in styles, The Last Jedi does have a different vibe, however he does not seem to know how to structure the film and both the script and narrative rhythm are problematic, the film soon takes the same path of Empire Strikes Back but what it was interesting in that film, in this one it feels incredibly boring. I'm sorry but seeing things right, the film should have been focused on Luke and Rey, especially taking into consideration all the changes that the film introduced to the mythology and the powers obtainable by the Force.<br/>All the action that takes place outside Rey, Kylo Ren and Luke is practically irrelevant. It's clear that the story needed to give the other actors something to do, but their story was completely unusable, they even wasted Benicio del Toro in such a simplistic character.<br/><br/>The Last Jedi redefines the Force and that is perhaps its greatest achievement, besides giving a hard but incredibly necessary blow to the fans, the decision to let go of the past, something they hated so much with The Force Awakens when Han Solo died, they will hate it much more now that Luke dies in this installment. It is worth asking if some kind of agenda of inclusion and diversity had something to do with the narrative direction of the film and it's not that I have something against it, it's simply that the path marked by George Lucas ends in this film, after all who will bring balance to the force and the galaxy will no longer be an Skywalker, it will be those who come along with Rey who as revealed in this film is simply a nobody, without an spectacular or striking lineage, Rey is just a common young woman who is involved in something huge and yet she's ready to face it.<br/><br/>Other problems I have with the film have to do with the enormous ability to discard narrative lines and their characters, mainly those who seemed to be quite relevant at first and I refer clearly to Snoke, it's incredible that after the release of The Force Awakens for two years I read all kinds of crazy theories about the character and it turns out that he was also a nobody and they got rid of him very badly. Also, what the hell happened with the Knights of Ren? Also it aonly gives a small glimpse of what happened between Luke and Kylo but it feels so shallow that even in his final battle the emotion feels empty and Luke's farewell does not become as resonant as it should have been.<br/><br/>But making those elements aside, essentially The Last Jedi stays sharp, is a solid entertainment film and a decent addition to the franchise, the duration is somewhat excessive, especially for the rhythm problems I mentioned and also for me it wasn't the movie it promised it would be but in the primordial elements the film fulfills its mission, there's space action, lighsabers battles, tension, emotion and entertainment but as I said before, a lavish and updated show is no longer enough, the stories also must improve.<br/>But it goes without saying that the new road is paved and the future of Star Wars is in the air and I don't mean in the air like uncertainty, I mean that now from this point on everything has changed and everything is possible, it's true that with this franchise both Disney and Lucasfilms will never take risks, but I hope that with the constant exploitation of the franchise that now seems to be an annual event, good ideas will remain in a safe place. **On a smaller note I just have to mention that if in Episode IX, Kylo gets redeem like Vader in Return of the Jedi, I will be very upset, because that is choosing the easy road and this film hints towards that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie SUCKED so bad its so horrible. This movie put scar in my heart an scar that may take a decade to heal. In this movie Rey parents are revealed to be nobody's and Supreme leader Snoke is a nobody and just killed of by Kylo Ren, that weak little wimp gets to kill Snoke by tricking Snoke rather than having 1 on 1 fair fight that should have been saved for episode 9. We learn Nothing about Snoke. Knights of Ren are never shown in this movie.Don't even get me started with Luke Skywalker Disney and feminist Kathleen Kennedy along with the stupidest dumbest director Rian Johnson who not only don't understand Star Wars but they disrespected the old characters of old Star Wars movies. Luke Skywalker is completely different character he is grumpy barley teaches Rey anything Rey learn to swing the light saber like a true Jedi all by herself in 2 days where in the prequel took more than decade for Jedi to be able to swing light saber accurately. Luke is fully disrespected in this movie. Luke is not only coward and a disrespectful person but also he is so pathetic that he tried to attempt to kill his young nephew Ben Solo while he was sleep because he sensed the dark side in him I mean is this really the same guy who went on suicide mission to bring back one of the evilest villain of the galaxy aka Darth Vader back to the light side. So Ben Solo became Kylo Ren because is not his fault it was Lukes fault and he is just a dark side user for no reason from the beginning. Oh wait Lia is also force user her ship get destroyed and she is a vacuum of space and she can fly like superman or better yet Merry Poppins. Somehow She is not killed through her ship exploding but she can fly in space like superman this scene with Lia is so bad you would think its made by some dumb inexperienced movie maker. Rey parents are revealed to be just 2 junker selling her as a slave for money in another words a nobody's so all these 2 years of theory of speculation were just for nothing and biggest waste of any Star Wars Theorist time along with Snoke as well since he is killed and we learn nothing about him. Rey not only becomes one of the strongest force user and saber duelist but she does all of this in 2 days without learning anything from Luke Skywalker she even abandons Luke Skywalker and leaves due not learning anything and she even beats Luke Skywalker in 1 on 1 duel which is so stupidly done. Fin and the new Character Rose story is pointless and stupid as well and their story arc only gets no where other than Rose falling in love with Fin after just meeting him for 12 hours in the story. Captain Phasma comes back with zero character arc only to die a few minutes later by Fin some people say she is alive but at this point is pointless to bring her back for 3rd time just to kill her again and the actress who plays her Gwendoline Christie is very talented but just like force awaken she is a wasted opportunity and speaking of wasted opportunity Benicio del Toro character of DJ (lamest name ever in Star Wars) plays this pointless hacker character that is suppose to be a terrible copy of what Lando Calrissian betrayal arc in Empire Strikes Back where he betray Fin and Rose and just leaves the story pointlessly where as in Empire Strikes Back there was so much emotion between Han and Lando being best friends but in this movie del Toro character DJ is that character you don't care or have feeling despair and anger for betraying Fin and Rose. If del Toro played admiral Thrawn would have been so much better than this shallow character. The new planets in this movie are completely soul less I don't even understand why some people say this movie looks amazing visually because it does not look amazing visually the prequels had way better visual than this movie can ever have. Also the movie has barley any music score in it as if Disney decided to scratch the idea of giving an amazing and memorable music not just in this but Rogue one and Force Awaken as well.This movie will not only make you uninterested and unexcited for episode 9 but also puts scar in your heart by betraying and disrespecting everything the original Star Wars Trilogy stood up and will even make you not wanting to watch the original trilogy because whenever you watch the original trilogy you realize how pointless the outcome of everything Han, Luke and Lia worked so hard will be. Also Rey is the worst Star Wars protagonist she is good at everything with no hard work or training, she never goes through any hardship like Luke and Anakin and also the idea of self sacrifice for greater good is completely dead in this move. If I could I would vote this movie -8/10 its one of the worst sequel ever made and one of the worst movie ever made. This movie will go down as the worst Star Wars movie of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I felt it was a decent effort in character development for the future films, but the tepid story and plots holes kind of ruined a lot of the positives.  Additionally, a lot of the middle could have been shortened, and the whole Rey self-discovery portion didn't make sense to the lay-person (me), especially since I didn't major in English, so I have no idea what all that symbolic imagery meant to her character or to the story.  With that said, light-saber and spaceship battles never hurt a Star Wars film, so at least we had that going for us.  And the dialogue and character stories were decent, so at least it's got that in favor of it over the prequels.<br/><br/>Another negative is that I don't really like Adam Driver's performance for Kylo Ren.  I'd say it's just too emo or bratty, not that layered like Daisy Ridley's depiction of Rey.  The rest of the cast is pretty decent, with Mark Hamill upping his charisma at midichlorian levels we haven't seen since Episode IV.<br/><br/>So in the end...am I glad I saw it?  That's kind of a push.  It's 2.5 hours of some excitement, followed by some dragging on and a little disappointment and confusion, followed by some ok fight scenes, and ending with a lukewarm feeling in the end.  Would I have watched it if I'd know what the experience would have been like?  Eh, I guess so, just so I would know the story in case we get rave critic AND user reviews for the next installment.  And in case Matthew Vaughn, Joss Whedon, or one of the Nolans happens to sign on for the next project.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

When I left the theatre after Episode 8, I had gripes but overall was satisfied with the sequel. The more I think of it however, the less charitable I become:<br/><br/>- No focus on chemistry and romance. Let me guess - Finn and Rey will not get together, and we won't see even an actual love triangle as the ending of 8 implies. Just an all-white final kiss to cap off what has generally been an impressive egalitarian showing for the cast and crew. Unfortunate.<br/>- Destroying genuinely interesting stories. Snoke is dead. Rey's lineage answer: dead. Kylo Ren having a genuine, lasting internal struggle. Dead. Same for Rey. Dead. - Biting off more than it can chew. Rey's exploration in the first half of the film - genuinely moving. The sideshow with Finn and Poe on a ship running out of fuel? Boring, full of plot holes, and what the hell is Benicio del Toro doing here? - Destroying the legacy of Luke Skywalker: the user reviews speak for themselves here, and I think there is something about how his character is portrayed that simply doesn't jive with the character from Episode 4-6. It does tarnish his legacy.<br/><br/>I didn't think it was a horrible film, but in some ways I'm more disappointed in it than I was for Episodes 1 and 2. I felt Episode 7 - a flawed but thrilling re-introduction with just a pinch too much nostalgia and copycatting -  was really setting up a dramatic home-run much like Batman Begins did for The Dark Knight. What we have here is a huge missed opportunity in the service of trying to do too many things at one. This should've been a focused film about budding romance, war, and an exploration of the force. Instead we got...DJ</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As of this writing, The Last Jedi is scored at 86 and has received 0 negative reviews from a pro.<br/><br/>I, being a modest Star Wars fan, saw the movie having not read any reviews.  I went in expecting to enjoy it.  I left disappointed, wondering what I had just seen.  The movie simply does not make any sense.  Characters have no believable motivation for behaviors they exhibit.  Actions do not have realistic consequences, even in the context of the Star Wars universe where we suspend a certain amount of disbelief.  Story arcs that seem promising go nowhere, and others that might have been more satisfying are resolved in the least clever ways with no subtlety or complexity, lost opportunities.<br/><br/>For Game of Thrones fans, the whole thing has a similar feel to the drop off in quality and depth between season 7 and all the content that preceded it.  Seasons 1-6 contained all kinds of amazing narratives.  The fabric of the story was complex, overlapping, interweaving.  Events connect across years in ways that are hard to predict, exciting & interesting.  In season 7, the internal consistency breaks down.  Compelling characters give way to big explosions, more CGI dragons and a complete disregard for rules that have previously been established in the fictional world.  TLJ falls victim to the same types of problems as season 7 GOT.  A combination of bad story telling and disregard for common sense ultimately doom the movie to mediocrity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
