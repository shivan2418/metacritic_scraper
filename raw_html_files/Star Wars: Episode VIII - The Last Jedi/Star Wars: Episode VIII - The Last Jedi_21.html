It never felt like a Star Wars movie. The Casino scene was unnecessary, Luke Skywalker wasn't Luke Skywalker. The porgs were oversold and Chewbacca was a set piece. Everything that wasn't Luke's story felt like time filler to the already bloated running time. "Well, we need something for Finn to do... Hey, Casino Royale" Poe needs to be a rebel so let's not make him privy to our plan so he can mutany. It made no sense why he wouldn't be included in the plan. And what the hell, Rey and Kylo's scenes were forced, they had to figure a way for them to share screen time. Essentially, the previous movie became irrelevant and all it's set ups were ignored. If you're telling a 9 episode story, why disregard the previous 7 so you can have the last one start all over? In the over-all arc of the saga, this one is a strange outlier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rae:  The Last Jedi is a terrific depiction of a female heroine, she is true to herself.  Can't elaborate with details - but I admire her choices.  For a kid whose childhood was incredibly bad, she is incredibly resilient, believes in herself and makes decisions based in what she values, including herself.  That's totally worth the entire film. My complaint is - she is ridiculously overpowered, a bit more training and deeper analysis of how this works with someone new would not go awry, think about it producers, please.   Rose and her sister:  Great characters, again terrific female characters.  Lots of insight here and depth.  I am not bothered by Rose and her interest, she is dealing with a lot and that informs her choices.  As this develops I imagine there will be more nuanced choices made, she does not strike me as particularly reckless.<br/>Leia and Rebellion Leaders:  Wonderful to have female leaders, especially with competence.  BUT A little heavy handed on the Resistance metaphor, seriously, I work in the current political resistance and felt this was just a little bit too much - even as it was deeply appreciated to see so many female leads - loved the emphasis on planning, patience and not on hotshot reckless crap.  BUT Leia should have dressed Po down in private for his choices a bit more, she coddled him which makes no sense.  And noone should wear long dresses in space, its just not practical for shifting gravity, blowing into space, infighting if you are boarded - it makes NO SENSE.  Kylo Ren:  I actually loved this character.  He is also true to himself in good ways and bad.  Most of these characters have depth, of the male characters Kylo/Ben appears to have the most depth and I enjoyed the gradual revelations of his character over the course of two movies and his relationship with Rae - in all its complexity.  The Bad:  Resistance ll's RESISTANCE:  About the RESISTANCE metaphor, I carried a photo of Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia during the women's march in Oakland and SF so I get it but this was incredibly heavy handed in drawing its connections to the world of today.  We were already there, you didn't have to work so hard, your viewers are not stupid, I was that little girl on Jakoo and the little boy in the stable - so I get needing hope.  When you work this heavy its as if the curtain pulls back and I see the strings, try not to do that. Finn and Po:  Getting better, although both could use more actual character development, the series has never been known for its depth but raise their insight scores, as they make some fairly bad choices based in self centered perspectives.  Why let Po get away with killing so many?  Not sure this is consistent with any military discipline, is that not a thing anymore?  BUT also ... Not every mistake has to be made by a guy and not every shallow observation or thought has to originate with a guy.  And while this was not entirely true, Kylo/Ben had some deep thoughts, the Rogue One characters were honestly better than this, take some authenticity from there.  Luke Skywalker:  Not a huge fan of this character, his wisdom is not incredibly high.  Still I liked him better here overall, but was dissatisfied with his choices with Rae and his lack of insight and connection to her character - I expected more.  His scenes with other significant SW characters were also dissatisfying and a bit inconsistent with the past.  Luke went through some tough stuff, but I expected more wisdom and growth with age and was disappointed not to find it here in this film.<br/>On another note ... Han was the hopeful one in the end, and that wasn't what I expected 40 years ago.  BATTLES:  Battles were better here overall, but NO Science in these BATTLES:  Here is one of my most annoying issues.  There is no gravity in space.  Are the bombs magnetic?  Why is the bomber so slow - it makes no sense when there is no "falling" in space, momentum yes, force yes, falling no.  Why approach the ship on that axis? Again, the approach makes no sense for everyone to come at the ship in a single plane, its like they are lining up to be shot one after the other.  Space has no up and down, battle scenes need to reflect that.  Fix this, it literally takes us out of the action!  Explosions in space, again, speak with scientists, battle scenes need to make sense.  Loved the escape battle though, and the planet surface scuffles made more sense.  BUT wow, these are far too conventional, I want to see more variety for a civilization that has advanced space travel and FTL.  Overall, liked the movie a lot!  One of my favorites of the franchise although Rogue One will always be my fave - its just more real, and made so many great choices.  Can't wait for next movie!    Please stop retreads:  no more casino/cantina tropes.  no more speeder chases if you can help it.   LOVE the changes involving the force.  Would love to see Rae understand balance can be grey.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

TLJ has pacing issues, inconsequential narrative choices, disconnected dialogue and monologuing, and almost no character growth or arcs. What some critics seem to like are the subverting of expectations. The problem for an audience member such as myself is that those subverting of expectations completely destroys my willing suspension of disbelief that is required for me to buy into a fantasy/sci fi movie. I had an understanding of the powers of the force that were contradicted in order to surprise the audience. The physics of space battles never made sense, but this movie adds in bombers, "gas", and FTL maneuvers that completely subvert expectations and make every space battle in the other movie no longer make sense. Characters go on quests for MacGuffin characters that aren't found and this call into question the narrative choice of creating that MacGuffin. Objects and character histories are set up as being important and then tossed off for a cheap shock. If they aren't important, they shouldn't be including in the storytelling or else I start to question the nature of the storytelling itself and this destroys my suspension of disbelief. I learn of a military industrial complex backing everything and this makes me question the insistence on a good vs evil structure in the previous movies. I am forced to conclude that Leia is just a patsy for the corporations interested in setting up and selling weapons to two warring parties trying kill each. The mythic story is lost and replaced with bad social commentary.<br/><br/>All of these suspension of disbelief problems are easily overcome if I am emotionally invested in the movie. Unfortunately, the filmmaker seems entirely uninterested in making us care about the characters. I just didn't care.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It was awful film that felt less like Star Wars and more like another Marvel film. The Last Jedi surprised me thought. Providing very enjoyable Star Wars experience more similar to that of Star Wars games like KOTOR or Jedi Knight series. It felt good, it was intriguing even though that Rey still is a shallow character as in previous film and even though Kylo is so emotionally unstable that he would put Mel Gibson to shame, I liked his character. Biggest down side is the humour which reeks of Disney, and the fact that many questions have been left unanswered. Too many in fact. But overall this film was good and I'm happy to see that Rian Johnson is coming back to direct the next trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is almost as if he had waited for decades for playing in this movie. Which makes me feel a bit sorry for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cons:    More plot holes than you could shake a space cruiser at, held together by ridiculous coincidences.    One-dimensional characters who talk about but show no emotions and who, when discarded, leave the audience indifferent - other than established characters who are discarded for no discernible purpose.    Characters whose behaviour seems to serve no rational goal.    Entire plot lines that severed absolutely no purpose but to have the characters pontificate.    Serious breaks with the sagas' premises to allow for developments that again leaves the audience puzzled.    Scenes as absurd as a flying English nanny they made me wonder what Disney thinks about its audience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>All in all, Disney seems to go the same path with the Star Wars franchise as Sony went with Ghost Busters: Forget the hitherto loyal fan-base, clean the slate - and then play silly games with it.<br/><br/>A New Hope was the first movie I ever went to twice. I count observing my kids as they watched episodes IV to VI in wonder to my fond memories. After the prequels and The Force Awakens, Rogue One seemed to be a turn to the better. But now, I think Disney is on spot with its message of The Last Jedi: Leave the past behind you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Absolutely loved the original trilogy. Prequels were...interesting. Old books, cheesy cartoons / CGI shows etc. But there were so many things in this film I did not enjoy. As a film, let alone a Star Wars film.<br/><br/>What I liked:<br/>- Puppet Yoda<br/>- Yoda / Luke scene and interactions. - Bomber run scene at the start was very cool. Loved the struggle you feel for the Rebels. - Unexpected twists with Poe's plans.<br/>- Visual effects. - Brief team up of Rey and Kylo.<br/>- I was ok with the whole Carrie Fisher Jedi float scene. Why not, Jedi do some crazy amazing things. Expand on it. (Did not like how she was basically not harmed from the massive explosion though.)<br/><br/><br/>What I did not like:<br/>- Entire plot revolved around Rebels being slowly chased. Empire not able to send a few ships in front, or the sides. Very odd plot, especially for being 80% of the movie. - Empire is seen as disorganized goof-balls with tempers. Yes, their ranks are thinned. Make them a bit more serious please. - Snoke being killed off immediately. No history revealed. Figured something will be in the 3rd film. Poorly done regardless. - Entire Wacky-Crazy Adventures of Finn and Rose leading to nothing. Phasma death(?) just tacked on during the Wacky-Crazy Adventures.<br/>- Not seeing more of the crazy cool looking Casino world. Tons of potential. - People finally decide warp-suicides are a thing. Could have done this a lot sooner.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There is one part in particular that is REALLY dumb, but other than that I thought it was a great movie. Seems most of the butt hurt comes from people being upset that THEIR fan theory didn't come true. They made something new. They didn't just recycle the same old crap into a new package. People should be happy about that, but people are ignorant. They claim they want something new, but they want the same old crap with a new coat of paint. Boo hoo haters. Just enjoy the film for the great experience it is...except for that one part...that one really dumb part.

So many bad writing and directing decisions. Second worst Star Wars film after The Phantom Menace. Obvious director didn't know what to do with Phasma and Snoke so he just killed them. Slowest chase in history, why did Hux not just send ships ahead of Rebel ship by light speed to cut them off? Why did Haldo not just tell Poe the plan? So many awful scenes, Luke throwing the lighsabre over his shoulder, Luke milking the creature, the ironing scene, Leia's scene in space had the audience in stitches, every scene on Canto Bight, topless Kylo Ren, Anakin 2.0 and the list goes on and on. Johnson should be removed from any future Star Wars project as this was a terrible attempt at a Star Wars movie. I've seen every Star Wars movie in the opening week since 1977 and am a huge fan of the franchise, this one doesn't belong. Awful awful movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Speechless Disney - I am still in shock I think. All of the answers to interesting questions and cliffhangers from TFA were completely ignored in favor of introducing worse than JarJar - Rose and a plotline to talk about animal cruelty. What.... what... seriously? The fate of the galaxy is supposedly at stake here, but we need to take a random segway to watch people we don't care about ride donkeys and learn about why rich people are evil and animal cruelty is bad? It was so forced and cringy and out of place and a waste of screentime it felt like a saturday night live skit. The only reason this gets one star is because of the throne room fight scene, which was great. There were some other decent fight scenes, but they are forever ruined by the cringy humor and awful plot decisions i.e. fight with finn and phasma... ruined by cheesy deus ex machina finn saved by the elevator and bb8 piloting an ATST??!?! Wow, that was actually one of the worst things I have ever seen i.e. fight scene on salt planet ruined by cringy luke brushing dirt of his shoulder and rose rescuing finn who was trying to save the rebellion because she loves him after spending 5 hours with him?!? i.e. kylo ren fighting his way to the front of the rebel ship and blowing up the command center but then leia becomes superman?!?! Worst of all the entire plot was pointless. There was virtually no character development or interesting developments for the resistance except for the fact that we learned they are completely useless and now down to about 20 people that can fit into the millenium falcon. Possible the worst star wars of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm giving this movie a 6 because I felt that the story involving Rey, Kylo, and Luke was well-played. It introduced new and exciting aspects of the force while showing limitations as well. With that said, I was extremely disappointed in the movie. It nullified every single question raised from The Force Awakens and created a universe with virtually no depth. Who is Snoke? It doesn't matter, he was wasted. Who are Rey's parents? It doesn't matter, they are nobody.  The characters Poe and Finn were some fantastic characters created in TFA. Star Wars is a series that is known for having heroes that stand apart. Granted, not every decision will be a good one; however, when every single bad thing that happened is because the main characters subverted orders, it makes them completely unlikable. They were wasted and none of their pieces in the movie had any impact in the overall plot. Finally, I had a really hard time getting over what they did with Princess Leia. The random force floating through space is absolutely ridiculous. "That's not how the force works!" Interesting enough, there are some things that are in the "legends" books that could justify this; however, it was completely out of place. I felt it did a disservice to all fans knowing that somehow they have to reconcile her loss in the next film. Overall the entire Canto Bight piece of the film felt like a clip from Harry Potter meets The Fifth Element. Both fantastic movies on their own, but not Star Wars. It made it worse that this whole piece of the film was only to show how incompetent Finn and Poe are and had zero impact on the overall story of the movie. Maybe I expected too much to hope that Disney would actually have thought through the entire story from 7, 8, and 9. Instead, it just felt disjointed like the new director wanted to erase what JJ did in episode 7. I'm not saying that Mark Hamill was absolutely right and they should have stuck with George Lucas's vision (that would have been nice though), but they could have at least told a succinct story to satisfy all of the great questions raised from TFA. I waited for two years to find that it was useless to even discuss these topics. Final thoughts: The comedic relief was way overboard. The Porgs are only to sell toys, fine, whatever...<br/><br/>I REALLY liked the Ice Wolves. It made me think of this latest season of Rebels. I'm sad about what they did with General Hux because I actually liked his character in TFA. I am torn with the fight between Finn and Phasma. I think it came to soon to have Finn defeat her, I was hoping she would be better. I do like the callback to Rebels here when Finn hit her and it was just her eye. This reminded me of the Asohka/Vader battle.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Too much forced humor that felt out of place.  New characters are all bland and boring except for Kylo.  When I was leaving the theater I realized I have no interest in what happens in this story next.  This will be the last Star Wars movie by Disney I watch.

The film isn't afraid to destroy the past and build a new future with exciting twists and environments that feel at home in the Star Wars universe. It's weaknesses are apparent at times, but I think there are few true miscalculations. Some moments emotionally fall short and remind us that "What we're watching isn't real." But that's okay. We shouldn't ask this universe to be everything. Star Wars is a universe not built on hard rules and technicalities, but on  adventure and the fun-of-the-ride that comes with stepping aboard a mythology unlike any other in modern times.<br/><br/>At its best, the film is a remarkably fun journey and its single greatest accomplishment is  that it establishes a new direct. Defining the Star Wars universe beyond any one  character (past or present). The Star Wars universe berthed the Skywalkers, not the other way around... Overall, this is the 4th best of the 8 Episodes released. Better than Force Awakens, but is it  better than Rogue One? A repeat view will help parse this out in time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The PT "ruined" that and everybody moaned, now they don't do that and every body moans. HAHA<br/><br/>SNoke is snoke, a powerful force user that controls the First Order and Kylo Ren, that's it. Just like Palpatine even in ROTJ was the emperor that had force powers and controled Vader and the empire, that's it. But Snoke is dispatched without ceremony and the "Vader" of this generation gets to be the "emperor". The Sith are not "explained" in the OT none of it is, The Knights of Ren neither.<br/><br/>In ANH Luke was a nobody that was the son of a powerful user, Rey is someone that everybody thinks it's linked to that but it isn't, or is Kylo lying? In ESB half of the audience didn't believe Darth Vader why should Kylo be telling the truth?.<br/><br/>Obi Wan was a jedi knight that did nothing except confront vader and become all powerfull, Luke just did the same and in a cooler way.<br/><br/>In Ahn there's no reference to what controls what, nobody knows the extension of the empire, where the throne world is, nothing , neither on ESB.<br/><br/>ETC ETC ETC<br/><br/>Man , this movie is everything a Star Wars fan would want. Almost nothing got explained in the OT, just that luke was vaders and leias sister in the second and third movie.<br/><br/>I'm really happy they didn't explain a damn thing. This isn't grey's anatomy, this is STAR WARS.<br/><br/>The fanbase is spoiled if they want exposition. The emperor never nedeed exposition to be powerful.<br/><br/>I may be in the minority but this IS the way SW should be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The writer/ director had no idea how to please the legions of Star Wars fans across the globe or perhaps they just didn't care. The heroes are hard to root for and seem made to please every liberal and minority possible, never  mind the majority of the viewers. The villains are weak and uninspiring. The film basically urinates on all of Star Wars history. The way Luke acted AND died was unforgivable.

If it would’ve followed the elements of good storytelling.  Rian Johnson is a moron. He is a fool and a dimwit. Simply put, he is a simpleton whose incompetence to tell a story, let alone a good one will forever be the reason he is a failure. Rian deserves an amazing F- for not doing what kids can do. You can't make any movie, let alone a Star Wars movie without holding onto the basics of 'telling' a good story. YOU cannot make any movie without having a decent script, some decent direction and a decent understanding of how to tell it. You can't have Plot holes let alone hundreds of them. All stories, books and comics follow the ‘basic’ concepts of "STORYTELLING." It is not DIFFICULT to accomplish the ordinary task of telling a Story. Small Children and young Teens could've told a better Star Wars story!<br/><br/>The movie bombed beyond bombed because of money, Rian’s ego, and George Lucas’ weakness for selling out; Episode VIII goes down as the worse movie in Star Wars, worse than the prequels because Rian J. couldn't tell a story. Rian J. couldn’t tell a fairy tale to save his Life. Even George Lucas got storytelling right regardless of his C.G.I. dependence. Rian Johnson will forever be the guy who killed Star wars, killed its Mythology and Killed the World that Millions and Millions of Fans loved...because he simply wasn’t a good story teller...<br/><br/>That is what everyone is so upset about. There was no story here, which is incredible because J.J. Abrams handed one to him on a silver platter. All he had to do was continue what was started and tell the story. Instead of continuing what was started, Rian J. burned everything that was set up and then tossed it out the window; along with all Star Wars common sense, mythology and force rules. Star Wars lore has been forever changed! It is now mixed with our own universe (Godspeed?), marvels universe (too much slapstick comedy)and Lucas’. And I don't even want to go down the road of Politics. NOW STAR WARS is POLITICAL! While Disney will deny believing this movie was a failure, because a few hundred puppet critics says so, (Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic) it will in the future. They won’t take into account the nearly 120k audience critics that have given this movie a horrible 54%; and that's only 5 days. It falls everyday down 1%. Just watch that numbers plummet this Christmas weekend. I predict Disney will look upon this decision, to trust Rian J. with The Last Jedi, as THEE epic failure in launching this new era of Star Wars movies. Shame on you forever Rian! How you simply could not do what children can do. Also, the criticism is just getting started. It’s not even been a week. Can you imagine years of this? The prequels are still getting heat 12-17 years later. And yours tops them all because of your lack of skills telling a story, not the lack of story. (Abrams gave you a story) This movie is yours for life; I can’t wait to see how your future career path spirals downhill because of your epic failure. Why is it so bad? Because Rian J. created the worst Star Wars movie that could've possibly been told -and it didn't have to be. That’s the heart breaking truth for everyone. It didn't have to be TOLD SO POORLY....<br/><br/>Nobody cares that you went in the direction you did, nobody cares that you don't understand how the Force works or how you portrayed Luke so inaccurately and killed him in the most unimpressive way.....Everyone expected and accepted all of this in Disney’s new Star Wars... It's how you told the Story Rian, it's you couldnt tell the story. That will forever be the reason you failed. I hope they fire you in the coming months, I hope you realize just how great a monstrosity this was, and I hope the movie Gods blacklist you, curse and condemn you to Hollywood Hell!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

How did Maz get Luke's Lightsaber? Who are the Knights of Ren? Who is Snoke? Why are the good guys the underdogs again? Why is Rey so unbelievably OP?, Rose is a **** who will infuriate anyone who watches her with her "Save the Animals!" malarky, TLJ Luke is an assassination of who Luke Skywalker is, Admiral Holdo couldn't just tell everyone something that would have stopped a lot of conflict from happening in this movie it's almost as bad a plot hole as Luke not immediately asking Rey how the hell did she find him when Luke was oblivious that there was a map to him. oh god **** this movie. Then there's Superleia, other people say in this movie the force gets mystified again but i don't know why if anything this movie created so many plot holes regarding the force i can't it seriously anymore. It's just for plot convenience now, it's not a struggle that characters must train to learn anymore, literally anyone can do it without training even though Luke needed training and he's Darth Vader's brat. It makes no ****ing sense and it ruins the force for me. Like the force apparently space doesn't have any rules in star Wars anymore, i saw WW2 bombers in the movie drop bombs in space that need gravity to ever work. Also Canto Bight Casino feels like we're back in the prequels again, this entire section of the movie can be cut because of how pointless it is. Don't watch this movie, it sucks donkey balls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

When I see the bad user reviews, they remind me of the political posts one sees online. They seem to be written by people living in an alternate reality. A scary alternate reality I'd never want to visit. I loved this film, but I can see easily why some don't but to hate it with this passion makes no sense. Like the sad uncle who keeps posting on Facebook that Obama was the antiChrist or Trump is being targeted the FBI for assasination, you feel both contempt and pity for them. One thing I have learned is that there is a small vocal minority that can't tolerate having their expectations subverted. The film is just fine, a bit draggy in the middle and did zig a few places it should have zagged, but overall it's an excellent film and I can't wait to see it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The most jarring element is the change in tone. When Poe and Hux did their idiotic schtick in the opening scenes, my gut dropped. I hoped it was just a fluke, but sadly, it set the tone for the entire film. The dialogue, and campy humor felt like it was lifted directly from bad fan-fic written by a 12 year old with aspergers. The main story was so contrived, and made so little sense, that I wanted to get up and walk out. The subplots are completely pointless, go nowhere, are rife with political pandering, and leave a distinct "prequel trilogy" taste in the mouth. All of the set-up from The Force Awakens is completely disregarded, nothing is answered-or if it is answered it's  with an infuriating dismissive wave of the hand. There are several plot devices that are nothing short of a deus ex machina. The characters we've seen previously are treated with disdain, and the new characters are about as appealing as a colonoscopy. This movie was just awful. I truly hope that Rian Johnson is never let anywhere near a Star Wars movie ever again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are enough things that I cannot get past to give it a good rating, lore wise. First of all, Leia should be dead, I call absolute bs on the force pull. Second, I disagree with the force link thing, I am sorry but it was never like that in the rest of the canon, once again bs. Snoke served no purpose, he claims the force link but as a master manipulator myself, he didn't do jack, it happened naturally, he just tried to take credit for it. And the biggest issue... LUKES LIGHTSABER IN HIS PROJECTION SHOULD BE GREEN!!!! Yeah, its blue. Rey finds Anakins saber in episode 7, and Anakins saber is destroyed after the battle with snoke.

If this movie had another name in front of it other than Star Wars I would have to say it was a decent movie. Something like: space balls 2: the search for cash.<br/> Or maybe: Twilight 16:  Revenge of the brooding darth emo guy. The movie is a slap in the face to hard core fans who have read the books, played the games and have fallen in love with the universe and the lore. The writing of this movie feels like it wants to pull the characters out of the long time ago far far away and pull you right back into our over the top politically correct, dumbed down humor world.  Unfortunately, The Last Jedi feels like it was written by someone who either has no clue about or has contempt for the the existing Star Wars universe. The writers have no clue how to develop characters or advance a believable plot line. Everyone except the dead are in exactly the same situation in the end as they were in the beginning.  Except for maybe the giant space llamas. Even Luke has gone from self hermit exile to self force exile. The situational plot drivers feel like a bad sitcom scene.   The captain has to drive and go down with the ship even though we have all that cool auto pilot ai crap and robots who could have actually hit the center of the dreadnought or have instantly calculated a path to take out as many enemy ships as possible. Naaaa not dramatic enough for an underdeveloped character death right? I am still amazed they didn't have General Acbar yell, "It's a trap!" right before he flew out the window.  Why bother going into the Star Wars universe when you can just take Star Wars to Vegas.  Craps tables , slot machines and all. And giant llama racing,  cool cgi animal rights activism filler is much more important than spending time on actual character development.  Who goes to jail for a parking ticket anyway?  Hell even the physics from other movies doesn't apply anymore. In previous movies one of the fastest ships in the Galaxy could not out run a star destroyer. But as they were whining on a star destroyer about never being able to catch the slow tugboat looking ships I was hoping dark helmet was about to run in and save the movie with ludicrous speed. Watching the movie felt like a dumbed down Millennial rant on how old people are bitter and fundimentaly broken, teachers are useless, and kids are good at anything they want to be and get a trophy without ever having to practice or train.  And don't forget your portable safe space so if you run out onto a battle field to say something to someone everyone will stop shooting and forget they hated you. <br/>Its funny how the most powerful Jedi ever, had to train for years to learn how to do simple things. However Rey can use the force right out of the box and do anything. She can beat down jedi with out ever having to train in the force. Its sad we did not know this years ago. It could have saved the jedi years of wasted time, or at least saved Luke from 8 months of running around flipping through a swamp with a frog on his back telling him he was not good enough. No wonder he was bitter.  It makes sense to change the training a Jedi thing.  Kids now days might not understand or believe the concept of having to train and work hard to be good at something.  Yuck . Who would want to buy that toy?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But seriously, I would rather have Jar Jar in every single Star Wars movie than watch the Last Jedi again. Stop defending it. It's not about theories, or about Luke Skywalker dying or about Rey and Snoke being nobodies. It's just that the movie sucks. End of story. The plot is not well written and it hardly develops throughout the movie. They build up the hype in TFA for nothing! If you want your characters to be no one, don't make it look like they are related to somebody we know! Besides, half of the movie is about two characters, one of them we don't know, and what they do is completely pointless. Finn and the asian chick could have just sat at the corner of the screen waving, because they entirely made the movie boring, as NO ONE cares about them. The script is just ridiculous. We understand that they want to make a new saga, one I won't be part of (I consider that without Skywalkers there isn't more Star Wars, as Lucas said Star Wars was about the Skywalkers), but they completely ruined it with this movie. They insulted our favorite characters and made their new ones look like invencible gods, aka REY, that without any training she is capable of besting Luke Skywalker... WTF PEOPLE. This movie is **** bad written and completely insulting. Its becoming another Avengers: the plot is not interesting but it has good visual effects and we can sell lots of **** **** Disney, I hope you crumble down to the ground like the Empire did. And thank you Mark Hamill for always supporting the fandom, even if it has cost you your character's life in this new garbage movie. People can say what they want and try to lie to themselves, but this movie has no redemption at all. What they did to Princess Leia... left me speechless. But what they've done to Luke? **** insulting. I'm out of this saga, but at least I have the Original and god, even the PREQUELS are better than this BS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

What people want is a "good movie" instead.<br/><br/>Also the movie didn't give a s*** about the last one (which itself was also not very good).<br/><br/>Basically it is a Return of the Jedi ripoff that has a stupid Hoth-like scene.<br/>The movie is way too long for it's content.<br/><br/>I never thought I would hope for George Lucas to return.

I frustrated the narrative in the news is that these negative reviews are false.  This is a real review.   ** SPOILERS AHEAD** I saw Star Wars in 1977 with my dad and I was 10 years old, so I have loved Star Wars for 40 years of my life. What I liked:<br/>The battle with Kylo and Rey in Snoke's thrown room. I like how Snoke was assassinated sort of like what would happen in Ancient Rome. The problem is that Kylo is not a fully developed character toward total evil to lead the First Order. Perhaps Ep. IX will save this movie. I hated the following:<br/>1. Luke: Disney ruined the legacy of Luke and what Lucas set up. Luke deserved better. Luke was a grumpy old man who has trashed the Jedi order. Then he becomes a coward and does a force astral projection and dies of exhaustion. Wow what a waste. Why not let Luke go out with a more epic way (i.e, have Luke in the flesh and Rey be ambushed by the Knights of Ren). 2. Plot-holes: Rey is a "Mary-Sue" who can do everything with no training. Finn -- a sanitation worker -- can take on Captain Phasma who is a trained soldier. Bombs in space; Light speed ships as weapons; force ghosts (Yoda) using lightning (why not have all the force ghosts take on the First Order?) 3. Casino story line: Waste of time and went know where except to introduce Rian's new trilogy in the future. Self-serving. Disney had to go all political with animal cruelty. I'm on the side against animal cruelty but it just didn't fit and I felt like I was watching the Disney channel sitcom. 4. Bad/Forced Humor: I felt like I was watching Guardians of the Galaxy or Avengers. They work in those films, but not in Star Wars. Luke throwing his dad's light saber over his shoulder was a huge slap in the face to everyone who loves Star Wars. It was not funny. These criticism only scratch the surface how bad this movie is. I'm sad to see Disney trounce on the legacy of Star Wars like this. Again, I'm a true fan and not a robot writing this review. Go see this movie form your own opinion. But I hated this film and I feel like Disney has just trashed everything to start over with their own thing. I'm open-minded to go in new directions. That's cool, but this just seemed so much in my face. My only hope is that JJ Abrams can rescue this pile of trash. Give some background to Snoke. Have it so that Kylo lied about Rey's parents and that she is truly the daughter of a legacy character. Redeem Luke!!! Have him so he only teleported away-- not died-- near the end in TLJ. Let Luke in the flesh take on the First Order and then die in an epic way. Have Kylo full evil and not conflicted as he rules the First Order in a heavy handed way. Have Rey get training by Luke.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Teasers from The Force Awakens (Who's Snoke, Who are Rey's parents), went unanswered or - at best - left with unsatisfying answers. Luke's climactic scene was stupid; I completely understand why Mark Hammil said this was not his Luke. This isn't the star wars you grew up with.

My opinion is that it was not a bad film per se, but that it was a very ambitious one.   There are things that happen in this film that were completely unexpected that will work for some but be loathed by others.    The film did have some memorable fight scenes and the acting as a whole was just as good as it was in The force awakens. The return of Mark Hamill was a great addition even though there were a few scenes that seemed off for his characters tone. Personally the biggest let down for me was that Rian Johnson seemed to completely disregard a lot of setup of J.J. Abraham’s film and just make his own movie.  There was clearly a clash between the two director’s narratives and I think it ultimately hurt the film.    In the end it was an enjoyable enough film for me, as I am a fan of the genre.  It just didn’t meet the qualities of my anticipation, after waiting 2 long years for this film.  I am still looking forward to see the conclusion to episode 9 as I still love the new characters and would like to see how their story ends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It ranges from dull to the absurd, and at times bordering on comedic for all the wrong reasons. Both the action and comedy fall really flat. At its best the movie is mildly entertaining in places. The Force Awakens was not perfect but was a largely decent film, with some standout great moments that you would be happy to rewatch. I cannot think of any part of this movie I would want to rewatch, no scene was that great. The plot? What plot..? Nothing really happens. Nothing is really explained or explored in any depth with regard to the characters, you are largely left with the same questions you had at the end of Force Awakens and some new ones. Want to know who Snoke is? Not gonna happen. And it generally goes that way.<br/>Rey, Kylo Ren, Luke Skywalker are briefly given tiny plot reveals about their past but nothing greatly significant, and for a 2.5hr movie, it begs the question WHY? The story does not advance in any meaningful ways, and subsequently feels like a wasted opportunity. Much of the film has you trudge through painfully familiar territory, space battles, chase scenes, light saber fights etc. But none of it felt particularly exciting or necessary. It’s like the plot could be condensed into a 10 min video and then the rest was just Star Wars filler. It’s easily one of the worst films I’ve seen in 2017. It’s was dreadfully average in every way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Watch Rotj (Epsiode 6) before and you will see what I mean. It is just terrible to see what Disney has done to the #1 hero of my childhood (Luke Skywalker). I know understand why Mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagrees with everything Rian Johnson (the director) has done to the character and I think it is an understatement.<br/>(2) The movie is spammed by over commercialized stupid humor. What might work in Marvel movies (of which i like most) has no place in Star Wars.<br/>(3) The story doesn't close any loose ends but creates even more.<br/>(4) The movie often shocks for the sake of shoking instead of going along with the story.<br/>(5) Star Wars was always conceived to be based on a steoretypical hero-saga and as a optimistic movie to teach moral ideals. This is simply not the case anymore it is littered with postmodern nihilism.<br/>(6) The Soundtrack is still John Williams, but we certainly know better from the Maestro.<br/>(7) The story is written in a way as to devalue and annihilate everything the protagonists of the first 6 movies have fought for. Like Disney would want to make people forget that there were even SW movies pre-Disney.<br/>(8) Disney/Kathleen Kennedy/LucasFilm promised for the last 3years that the whole point of rebooting the Canon (except for the 6 movies) is to make them more coherent which is a blatant LIE after this movie.<br/>(9)The acting was professional and the actors were really in their roles, too sad it was wasted on such a movie.<br/>(10) The movie has a few bigger plotholes, atleast one of them big enough to change the outcome of the complete movie during the first 20 minutes (hard to describe without spoilers) - and a smaller one regarding the geopoltical situation for example<br/><br/>Episode 9 would have to put so many things right and retcon so much to leave me with even the slightest interest in the franchise that it is almost impossible.<br/>I will take any future SW release with strongly reserved cautioness if at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

WTF!!!<br/>I am so happy I did not bring money to the cinema. I just went thru the last three money grabbing bs films on kInOx.To. Don't make the people anymore richer who buy IPs to rip open the consumers that are just wallets to them. Disney pissed on all that was good about Star Wars, which wasn't really that much, and now bring us Bomber in space that don't shoot rockets, but drop bombs on ships in space like in WWWII on a planet!!!<br/>SW is SciFi-Fantasy, but a tiny rest of standard physics should be respected! The Force always was a very restricted tool and even Yoda could lift only so much, but this film broke everything. It left us with broken characters, story telling, laws of nature and good taste. Hollywood is a SJW mess now. ALL good characters are women and ALL a_s_s_h_o_l_e_s are male. And this white entitled female knows to use THE FORCE(TM) without any training. Of course she trains herself! A male trainer would also make the feminist audience this trash caters too go on a Twitter s_h_i_t_s_t_o_r_m spree and we don't want that!? NO.<br/>Star Wars is long dead. Drop the IP and forget it. It's time!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Knowing that reading reviews can taint the experience I've deliberately stayed away from any Star Wars related publications. After the excellent Rogue One, I went in with great expectations. Unfortunately I quickly realised what a bad decision I made. This is without doubt the worst Star Wars movie to date. Think Phantom Menace was bad ? I now think back to that movie with fondness. 30 minutes into the movie, I was wishing I was back in the dentist chair. But I kept watching, hoping that it will redeem itself. It didn't. Without going into spoilers, the story was a daft drawn out affair. There was none of the comradery and banter that made the original such fun to watch. There were attempts at humor but nobody in the cinema was laughing. It all felt fake and sad. There was also no build up, the whole movie felt like it was stuck in second gear. While watching it I kept thinking that there is nothing original here,  nothing that hasn't been done before. Just a badly executed rehash of Return of the Jedi with a bit of Empire Strikes Back thrown in. The director somehow managed to make a three hour movie with no actual story tell and no emotions stired. It is the only Star Wars movie where I couldn't  wait for it to end, wishing that they just put all the characters out of their misery and be done with it.<br/>If there is one advice I could give is to save your money, buy some popcorn and watch the original trilogy instead (or anything else for that matter).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It absolutely destroys Luke Skywalker, Underplays Chewie (And i know, noone cares about Chewie, Who is just sitting around all this movie, having lost Han and having not a care in the entire world)<br/><br/>There is one shot of R2D2. There is two shots of C-3P0. So if you're a fan of the old series, don't watch this. It's going to hurt- and hurt alot. The film refuses to acknowledge basic space laws of physics- from bombs falling in gravity in space- to decompression only existing when it's convenient- to shields being on or off depending on convenience- to ships needing "fuel" to stay ahead even though vacuum provides almost no resistance and they would maintain their top speed without fuel. It also ignores the previous film completely. Every plot point they made is ignored. Every chance to make a good scene thrown away. There are 8 or 9 plot twists in this piece of garbage, and none of them were surprising. There is 20 or 30 jokes in this festering dung heap, and none of them are funny.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson wanted to be "New" and "Unpredictable". He wanted it so badly, he sacrificed the soul of the series, basic storytelling, and Luke Skywalker. His attempt at "Plot twists" will only surprise those insipidly unimaginative enough to not see them coming.<br/><br/>This film dazzles with pretty lights and colors, imaginative flight sequences, and strings them along on a plot so thin you'd have to fold it 10 times to wipe with it, which is surely all it's good for.<br/><br/>Wanted to see something different, a smart and competent rey who doesn't abandon her training? You won't see it.<br/><br/>Wanted to see a daring change, where Rey turns to the dark side? You won't see it.<br/><br/>Wanted to see any plot where Rey develops as a character? You won't see it.<br/><br/>Wanted to see Luke Skywalker go from a paradigm of hope and bravery to a scared, grumpy old man who tries to kill his own nephew in his sleep? You'll see it. People are throwing roses at this, calling it "Brilliant" and "Unexpected".<br/><br/>It's the purest garbage i've ever laid eyes on. New fans are despising it. Old fans are despising it. It's score is sinking on every platform. Rian Johnson not only fails to capitalize on any mystery laid out in the much more admirable "The Force Awakens", but fails to even continue the basic plot. Luke goes from a man who went in search of a Jedi Temple for answers, leaving a map to be found- to a man who never wanted to be found and throws his own father's lightsaber off a cliff for a cheap laugh.<br/><br/>JJ abrams meant that scene to be a passing of the torch, both from Rey to Luke, and JJ to Rian Johnson. Johnson literally enacted that scene, throwing the plot and mystery off a cliff. If i had to describe this movie, i would describe it thusly:<br/><br/>Star Wars: The Last Jedi, is a freakish abomination of purposeful hatred bent on the destruction of all that came before it. Stumbling into life from the untalented and obviously egocentric mind of a director who views Star Wars as something subpar to be improved upon, instead of a massive universe of endless possibilities, it insults, belittles, and minimizes the efforts of many great storytellers, replacing their grand visions with it's own stunted and malicious message of "Just accepting the new" without thought. The film echoes this on every level, presenting somehow sluggishly a series of battles and intense situations interspersed with repeated jabs at the "Uselessness of the past" and to just "Let it go, even if you have to kill it". It does an admirable job of this- sinking it's inept and decaying claws into every facet of Star Wars, tearing away at universe and characters until nothing is left but the bare bones of a once great franchise.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------<br/><br/>I award this movie 0 points. If i could award it less, i would.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is Star Wars. Anyway, plot and subplot are completetely a disaster in terms of screenwriting. So It's not anymore a matter of how much FANS are attached to the franchise, it's that Hollywood it's not able, anymore, to distiguish between a bad or a good script, while they're focused (more than ever before) in a greedy, and really pathetic, search of gold. Could have we expected something different from Disney? Certantly not.<br/>Have I hoped something better from Star Wars? Certantly yes. May the force be with all of you, this is a really sad era.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Despite some shortcomings, TFA created a promise for a great episode VIII. Alas, it wasn't to be. The director Rian Johnson does not appear to understand what made Star Wars work. Childish humour was never a strength of the series and Johnson not only overuses humour, his intended jokes misfire one after another. Worse, like the prequels, TLJ has no sense for tone. One goes from tragedy to the most daft humour and back again. The best explanation for the mess that is TLJ is that Rian Johnson is having a whale of a time trolling all genuine SW fans. In any event, SW has been killed for good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Too often are "bad guys" just overly vilified as just pure evil with no reason and without showing their motivations. This movie helps to humanise Kylo Ren, which makes it far more relatable and understandable, overall making the movie far more impactful.<br/>The rebels also fail several times and things go a completely different direction to planned (e.g. wrong codebreaker, failed disabling of tracker, failure to prevent gate destroyer) which is refreshing to see, it means you can't constantly accurately predict what's going to happen and again makes it more relatable and it feels more real.<br/>Another is maintaining the emotional side and tribute to the originals, Luke & Leia reuniting is genuinely touching and Yoda coming back to help end the Jedi is very refreshing and provides closure on the old trilogy.<br/>Overall, this is a really good movie and well worth a watch, ignore the review bombing, it's a great film!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Even Mark Hamill had major problems with how the character was portrayed.  From the first cringe inducing "yo mamma" joke right out of the gate, to Mary Poppins Leia.  Where to begin?  This movie is an absolute mess, and further proof that Disney had no gameplan whatsoever with this "trilogy".  Why is everyone from the OT so dour and pathetic?  Why are no questions answered?  How did Maz, Leia, and Han all seem to know Rey for some reason in TFA?  Who was Snoke?  Why was Yoda acting like he did when he first met Luke on Dagobah, when he was originally only trying to trick him into thinking he wasn't Yoda-- at no time in the prequels or after Yoda dropped his act did he act like a giddy laughing weirdo.  Why am I watching 40 minutes of Benicio Del Toro stuttering?  This film left me no real desire to see Episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's been a week since I've seen it and I am still confused as to what the director was trying to achieve. He hoped that people would be surprised by how fun and funny the movie was, but the humor was just awful and misplaced and took you out of the seriousness of the scenes and the situation.<br/><br/>I thought the Luke and Rey stuff was "alright" and I just wish there had been more screen time given to them, instead of that stupid casino scene which was completely pointless to the plot. I think they're absolutely brilliant actors and they didn't utilize them enough. I felt like they could have done more with the already established and meme friendly characters as well. They could have added way more emotionally traumatizing scenes using those characters, I was almost ready for that. I don't mind them ending the old stories and reinventing Star Wars, I was ready for that as well. But what I ended up seeing was this hollow mess of a film. Like they wrote 7 different stories for the film, cut the scenes up into strips mixed them up and glued them back together and said "that'll do!". I didn't think any of it was clever, I didn't wrestle with my morals, I didn't feel any emotional resonance with any of the dramatic things that happened. It was just frankly ridiculous to the point in being comical in places (Leia). Most of the important scenes are just copy pasted from the old films but done way worse. There are continuity errors ALL over the place. Huge swathes of the plot were pointless to the point I was left exhausted 2/3 of the way through the film, I was ready for it to be over before the last act even started. Some of the random plot props they through in also made no point or sense (the books in the tree, we'd never seen them before so it made no impact). I think getting this director on was a complete mistake. He wasted so much potential. The GOOD parts of the film were the Graphics, the start was a pretty good space battle. I wish there were more interesting and visually appealing scenes other than the Casino, but the plot left no room for that. A couple of interactions between Rey and Luke were funny or interesting and left you wanting more. I really wanted to enjoy this film or feel something for this film, but the only thing I felt was disappointment. I'm quite jealous of the people who did enjoy it and don't judge them in any way, but now I'm really worried for the future of films in general if this is what critics think is a great film. Valerian had more of a star wars feel than this was, it had more charm and characters and great opening scenes and establishing shots that made it a believable universe and was in general much, much better. Not perfect and a bit long but it was still coherant and none of it was pointless. Oh well..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Meaning I just didnt care. In fact it felt so tonally incorrect at times I winced and squirmed in my seat. Like you might do whilst watching a really bad stand up comedian or your uncle twerk dancing with your auntie at a wedding. WTF!<br/><br/>The opening scene with Poe and Hux felt like a Christmas Pantomime. All tension evaporated the moment he pretended to be on hold. DREADFUL! I didn't mind the Porgs or BB8 but serious evil and heroic characters should be just that. Luke seems to have been replaced? Mark Hamill was playing a guy called Luke. But it wasn't Luke. I didn't mind him being a recluse or grumpy. The trailer looked moody and cool. When he appeared in the film he was an unlikeable douche. AND HE MILKS A SPACE COW!! He is LUKE SKYWALKER not a bloody dairy farmer! I feel sorry for MArk Hamill. He has been betrayed. I can see why he disagreed fundamentally with the script. AND WHAT was with him chucking his lightsaber over his shoulder. It felt like a blooper they decided to keep in! I think that one moment is a brilliant metaphor for what Disney and Rian (Comedy) Johnson have done to the Star Wars legend.  Jedi Training!? Rey received NO training. I get more training at my Monday night Yoga class in Peckham than she received. Yet all of a sudden she is a Jedi Master WTF. I LOVED Empire Strikes Back becuase as a little boy I got to learn how to be a Jedi. How to use the force. I learned through Yoda about the dark side and light of human nature. Here Luke makes a lame Joke about reaching out! UTTER garbage. Train the girl. I wanted Rey to prevail from a struggle. Zero character arc and as a result I dont give a Monkeys. SPACE WALKING LEIA! Did no one say anything to Rian! Not one person pointed out that that was a crap idea. No One mentioned Mary Poppins! O........M........G that was bad. Visually it was great. But the writing and the characters was awful. Get Garth Edwards back!  At least he understood the Star Wars Universe. The last 3 minutes of Rogue One were better than the entire Marvel-esque gag fest that was Last Jedi. Why not get Get George R. R. Martin to write it! He'd do a fantastic job. At least he'd understand the human condition and struggle. I liked the political message! I liked the diversity. But all that has been flushed down the pan with the most expensive SNL skit in history.

It's that bad, and it's clearly polarizing because it's "Star Wars" and because it feels totally disconnected from the original movies. Even TFA was more thematically coherent than this hot mess.<br/>I personally feel that the movie was out of tune with the rest of the saga, I didn't like the need for jokes every now and then, for useless and uninteresting plot arcs, for the eulogy that "just trying" is enough, and that you don't have to aim for greatness, but just being stubborn is okay, even if your decisions lead to thousand of deaths: it's all fine, you are a good looking actor! All is good!<br/><br/>Kylo Ren is the usual emo kid (that's probably why this movie is liked by this hipster generation), Rey is - without any explanation - one of the most powerful force user in the galaxy without the need for a training. Luke is just an old bitter hermit who can remote fight another powerful user and trick him, the same user that just tricked Snoke and killed him. Wait, what? Consistency, where art thou?<br/>Maz reached out to provide a "contact" for a useless arc that just lead to a lot of people dying, but yeah Finn got a love interest in Rose so everything is fine, alright audiences?<br/>Leia flying? For **** sake, what did you have in mind, screenwriters? Do you think that moment was more powerful than the princess maybe dying for real, carrying consequences?<br/>Instead let's kill Ackbar off-screen, just to make a nod to older audiences.<br/><br/>What really puzzles me is the fact that a lot of people are not liking it and that the main theme is "they are trolls": maybe the ones that didn't like the movie are the most vocals, ok - but again, Star Wars is an iconic saga: there are people considering ****ing football a religion, so I don't see much of a difference. I really didn't like the movie, so I can't put a good vote to it. Let's see what will emerge in time, but I doubt this movie will stand the test of time. Beautiful visuals, but it's this movie that instead troll the public.<br/>Ad maiora.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Mark Hamill was absolutely right when he said this wasn't his or George Lucas' Luke Skywalker. Half the time he's what you would believe he would be as an old man, the other half he's doing slapstick comedy that belongs in a Space Balls movie. Finn and Rose (the most obnoxious character since Jar Jar) have a pointless story that accomplishes nothing. Poe's story ends up being worthless. It's like one good story you care about spattered with cringe worthy humor, sandwiched between meaningless boring stories that don't even feel like they're taking place in the Star Wars universe. Some people are overcompensating for their rage and saying it's a zero, but it is honestly objectively a bad movie. At least Phantom Menace had Darth Maul. This movie has nothing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Since my first Star Wars movie, which I watched 35 years ago until episode 8, these have always been the series closest to my heart. Not anymore. Disney and the amateurs responsible for that joke really did a great job alienating so many Star Wars fans. To cut the long story short:<br/><br/>1. I undestand now why Mark Hamill did not agree with the Director about Luke. I will pretend that the Luke story ends with Return of the Jedi. I feel betrayed and devastated after watching what he has become.<br/>2. Cheap jokes from B rating movies. We, the Star Wars fans are more intelligent than that. Who allowed such crappy humor in the movie?<br/>3. All questions after Episode 7 go in the garbage. Good job killing the fabula and the character stories, Disney. In short, I didn’t see any character stories in Episode 8. It all felt like a bad dream come true. What could have been done wrong with all characters was done wrong. Especially very terrible ideas about Snoke and Ray.<br/>4. This is the first Star Wars movie that made me bored on the 30th minute after watching it and I couldn’t wait to finish. I will never watch it again.<br/>5. Forget about all previous episodes. Disney did a great job restarting the series, unfortunately in the worst possible way.<br/>6. Bad character dialogues and story telling. I never felt excited or curious during the whole movie, which makes me feel strange as I have always watched previous episodes with great interest.<br/><br/>I wish the series ended with episode 6. Damage is already done, RIP Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I think we are even further behind plot-wise than we were in TFA? No major villans, no old characters, no exciting new characters..<br/><br/>I'll add that I especially disliked Han's golden dice, which were never introduced previously and never explained in this movie. Looks like I need to see the new Han Solo movie if I want to have any chance at understanding this movie! I can't wait to see how Han gets those dice... maybe at our favorite casino planet, where he will win the Falcon?  He will likely win at last minute and fly away just in time, leaving behind all of the slave children just like our heroes in this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The main conflict of the first half of the film was very dull, and most of the movie lacked any urgency.<br/>I really enjoyed some of the twists and character dynamics, and there was one fight scene that was particularly outstanding, but I felt like there was too much fat that needed to be trimmed from the script, and the tone was messy.<br/>I think the biggest problem with this film is that it kept the humor of previous films, like The Force Awakens, but lacked its heart, and its charm. There's also the way Rian Johnson handled Luke in this movie, which I wasn't particularly thrilled with, and one scene with Leia was probably written for Superman or Star-Lord (if you've seen it, you know what I mean).<br/>I'll end on a high note, Kylo Ren. While I'm not the biggest fan of the whiny dark Force user (See Anakin in ep. 2-3), and I initially got the impression that Adam Driver's performance was based solely off of the Tusken Raider massacre and accompanying monologue, he has turned out to be a really interesting character with a gripping screen presence and an epically awesome fighter (Where can I pick myself up a TIE Silencer?). His performance was easily my favorite part of the entire film.<br/>I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it to my favorite franchise.<br/>This movie was like a soup with a few absolutely outstanding pieces of meat floating in a cold broth of mediocrity. 6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Universal acclaim when so many people have problems with it feels like Hollywood shills can influence generations with their money and power.<br/><br/>I'm a star wars fan not a huge one but one none the less. I having seen clone wars. I didn't love tag but I liked it's setup and world building and hated its cornyness and nostalgia which is a similar feeling I have to tlj. I loved the original trilogy it's witty and corny at the same time. The prequels I also loved with their newscope and backfilling of the universe we had known. This movie had so many potholes that couldn't be glossed over and took me out the film. The cgi and filming was top-notch as was the soundtrack mostly. The corny lines were kids movie **** without the adult connotations that some kids movies do so well. The characters are dull as **** Rey is a lame duck but master fighter, kylo was better but doesn't seem to be growing, prepubescent anger, odd clumsy standard **** who reaches the same endpoint as ep8 by the end.<br/><br/>I think I hated this movie most because of the constant twists that are explained as plot points by the characters, good movies don't tell the viewer what's going on they show you through natural dialogue, emotion and leave some ambiguity. Bad movies have characters that literally real you what were doing now and next. There were million examples, will kylo kill his mum no he won't o wait she is killed anyway but wait she's alive and is now mary poppins but wait shes not strong and is now in a coma in 2 minutes of screen time wtf. Rose professes her love for fin after no onscreen chemistry or sexual tension and they kiss, and then he drags her back to base quicker than the FO walkers over massive distance past the obliteration of Lukes ghost. I have so many more yet I still liked some of it.<br/><br/>I don't like the direction Disney is taking this series and I need them to move on from the old characters quickly. Adding simple man's **** at every step to appeal to the largest audience is tarnishing one of my favourite franchises ever and I don't know if I can take it anymore. It starting to feel like fast and the furious in space.<br/><br/>Also I didn't read or talk about one fan theory except jarjar snoke and had no spoilers, I limited my exposure to the hype and only saw the trailer twice. I expected a return for the franchise and waited three days to see this movie which was less time than the last two. I was shaking in anticipation, something not normal for me as I lined up beforehand.<br/><br/>Also as a sane individual I didn't purchase battlefront 2015 or 2017 after pkating the ****ty betas and I've barely played a star wars game ever so maybe I just feel too strongly towards the film's.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Force Awakens mirrored A New Hope, and while it made sense to reassure returning fans, and give any new fans a fantastic story to start with, it disappointed me a little how safe they played it. The Last Jedi took all the expectations I had going in and threw them out the window.    Now most people are upset by this. They wanted all their questions answered more or less the way they were expecting. I feel the exact opposite, and yes I am a long time fan of ALL the previous movies, not that I should have to qualify my opinion with that. This movie was exhilarating. I can't remember the last time I turned to my friend in the theater with my mouth open in amazement because I'm so shocked about what just happened. It made the movie exciting, and the stakes higher, since I no longer felt completely sure about anything that was going to happen. Movies are ultimately just entertainment, and it certainly succeeded in that regard.    The visuals, acting, spectacle, sound, etc was phenomenal. The entire scene in Snoke's throne room made me want to cheer. I enjoyed this movie the whole way through, and I am excited about what direction the new Star Wars will take in the future. For all the people who want to nitpick every detail and piece of lore, Star Wars doesn't belong to you. It doesn't even belong to George Lucas anymore. If you don't like the ideas of the people who work very hard and do their best to make the best movie they can then don't watch them, and leave the rest of us alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

For me, it was a great Star Wars movie filled with awesome new sequences, fun new characters, terrific adventures, and unique romantic dynamics.  Mark Hamill brought new layers to Luke Skywalker.  His PTSD was quite believable.  I do understand a lot of people wanted Rey's parents to be these people, or Snoke to be this guy, or Benicio Del Toro to play this kind of character, and when they didn't get what they got, it really upset them.  Probably because Star Wars is truly owned by its fanbase.  That said, if I have to accept the prequels as canon, you're going to have to accept this new trilogy as canon.  Things don't always go the way you think.  But at its core, this movie has top notch acting, and breathtaking special effects.  You can't please everyone, but you did please me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The filler between those pieces were sloppy at best. Here's what I mean. SPOIILERS AHEAD<br/><br/><br/>Okay so the ending. The battle between force ghost luke and kylo was excellent. Luke was relying on genuine Jedi fighting style (more reactive, acrobatic, and at his level, more masterful) while Kylo was using sith style. It felt authentic. But then why did the effort kill Luke? That was weird. Speaking weird deaths: Snoke and Phasma and Alex(?). We had deaths of characters who's character arcs seemed under-utilized. Snoke's death is particularly surprising given that we essentially (should he truly be dead and boy howdy did he look dead) have zero idea of who he is. How Palpatine did not know of him. Any of that. While there are lots of theories and I'm sure the books are comin' that, is a cheap cop-out. Your movie must defend itself and right now (short some explanation next film) we feel a little cheated of Snoke's storyline (and to an extent phasma's as well).<br/><br/>So now let's get to the real issues. How in the hell is the First Order so much more powerful than the Resistence? I mean, we have seen their Star Killer base destroyed. A Dreadnought gets rekt in the first scene. Yes, they destroyed five Republic planets but even given that those planets were core worlds, even one being the capital, the resistance by the end of the film is two dozen people all inside the Falcon. That isn't a resistance. That's an unruly armed protest. Hell, there are fewer members of the Resistance than there were physical Star Destroyers pursuing them (and I believe the current numbers on troops in the smallest class of star destoryer is ten thousand extremely conservatively as in, just the officers required to pilot one and one of these star destroyers looked to be on par with the executor class AND housed Supreme leader snoke a ship that estimates about 100,000 people).<br/><br/>I can suspend some disbelief but come on here: what is going on where twenty people are beating a force that has them at what looks like a 100,000+ to 1 ratio? (And I literally mean like, twenty people, the entire Resistance force is ferried away at the end on the Falcon which according to Wookipedia can supposedly hold 1-2 pilots and 6 passengers so even twenty is pushing it). Then there's the issue of what the hell was the plan (from both sides) with that extended chase scene that really made up the meat of the film. The eventual solution was for a pilot of the last remaining rebel capital ship to make a hypderspace jump directly through the star destroyers tailing them. Which is rad but like, raises the question, why didn't any of the other two (one of which being a medical frigate which is a fairly large rebel capital ship) make this decision as their fuel was running low? They knew it was death as soon as the fuel went out and I literally made this comment in the film like, oh, I guess that's just not something they can do. And then it was the ultimate solution. Those two points are illustrative of what I think is ultimately the problem with the movie. There are great moments but the film labors to set them up by creating bizarre universe breaking and absolutely reality bending decisions/results. And these are world breaking things that break what is happening, in this very film, let alone the general star wars universe (why were the rebel bombers not Y wings???). Overall, I like this film less and less the more I think about it. I can't help but feel it was rushed by production to capitalize on a rigid release schedule and, if they'd just taken the time to iron out some of the largest, glaring details, it could have been a really great film. 5/10 would not recommend paying money to see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The scenes are BREATHTAKING.  There were literally gasps of how beautiful the imagery was.  If I were to want a cinematographer, it would be Rian.<br/><br/>As a WRITER, he's a complete mess.  The narrative goes in one direction.  The meta-narrative goes in a completely different direction. Neither going in a Star Wars direction.  Rian had some nods, but they were all visual (as expected from such visually focused director).  There is NO adherence to the laws of the Star Wars universe and is a giant middle finger to the whole series.  Then, if there was any doubt that this was intentional, Kylo blatantly states it in the movie.  This movie literally washes away all that would constitute the IP we know and love.<br/><br/>The plot holes this movie opens up are gargantuan and the contempt for the property is clear.  The overt heavy handed push from above is evident.  Kathleen Kennedy has killed this universe and is trying to rewrite it to fit her own ideology.  This will be made evident when Star Wars IX opens to the worst since Attack of the Clones.<br/><br/>I know I'm not going to see it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's trope destroying, and I think that's perhaps one of the things I like about it the most. All of the fan theories can kiss their arse goodbye, and I love that it had the guts to do this.<br/><br/>It's not a great movie. Not even close. It's not even particularly good. It's just better than The Force Awakens, better than Rogue One,  and probably better than all of the prequels too.<br/><br/>I hate that they made the choice to let go of one of the cast members, and I feel like I would have prefered to see more of them. I'm also disappointed in the scene where they effectively burn the last remnants of the jedi code, because it's like burning EU canon. There's no jedi code now, and that's how Disney like it, but the code of the sith and jedi are two of the only really interesting things in this fictional universe, so I was left feeling a little bitter at this.<br/><br/>But overall, it's a step in the right direction. It's a shame the series goes back to the master of playing safe for episode 9. JJ Abrams is the worst.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The last jedi's biggest problem for me, is that the over all tone just doesnt feel like the adult star wars bad ass movies we have gotten, even through the prequels. This was a little kids disney movie complete with so many poorly timed jokes and slapstick humor you lose track of the actual plot lines. My second biggest issue is the plot holes. George Lucas is called many things, but his team did a good job covering all of there nerdy plots because they know that nerds and fans love to debate star wars. And they did a pretty good job minus some things here and there. This movie was made by people that either are very out of touch with its fan base, or they are trying to change there fan base from nerds to more general public. Because this is not a movie meant for nerds. They dont even try to make the science make sense. They dont try to make the plot line up with the cannon of star wars at all. This is a movie for the general public to laugh and have a good time. If thats what disney wants to make star wars then so be it, but myself and the long term fan base is probably not going to stick around for another movie like this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
