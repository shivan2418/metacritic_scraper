There were a lot of unexpected turns and one character arc that wasn’t the greatest. However, upon my second viewing I appreciated the film and the risks that Rian Johnson took. No film is perfect but that doesn’t stop it from being good. First off, the characters were very well written and the action was choreographed to perfection. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley both give terrific performances as Kylo Ren and Rey and carry every scene they are in. Mark Hamill give his best performance of his career and Carrie Fisher is much improved over The Force Awakens. In fact, her performance proves that she can still act after all these years. Fin’s story arc is a weak point in the film and slows the movie down a little. There are many strong moments in this film that you will remember for years to come. There are small moments I could nitpick but they don’t affect the overall film. There’s some comedy that works and some that doesn’t, but again, it doesn’t detract from the film. I don’t want to ruin anything for anyone but this is a very different film from what I though it was going to be which might cause some to dislike it. However, if you go in knowing that this isn’t going to turn out the way you think, you’ll enjoy the story that was made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm not the type to review movies; honestly I don't care. After seeing this movie, however, and being a huge Star Wars fan, I must say this movie was a total disappointment. I think the prequels were actually good, the plots had structures. This movie on the other hand, the plot is everywhere. It is difficult at times to follow and there are parts that could be cut out. The whole Rose-Fin adventure is stupid, and feel the movie would have a much better flow without it. In addition, the humor in this movie is awful, its too in your face; it should be subtle. Its like Disney was trying to create material for Family Guy and/or Robot Chicken so they have nothing to parody in the end. The whole Luke brushing his shoulder off was totally unneeded. This movie should've been darker, but the humor really ruined it. There were a few great parts in this movie, but unfortunately  there's more bad that overshadows the good. I was excited after The Force Awakens for the next installment. After the Last Jedi though, I'm not as eager. I just hope J.J. Abrams can fix Episode IX and wrap this up in a respectable manner. Disney should cancel Rian Johnson's trilogy because clearly he doesn't know how to make a Star Wars film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If you get bored by the exhausting Marvel sequels (except the recent Thor!), you will be bored here. They truly are beating a dead horse with this film. Next time I want to dive into the star wars universe I should just rewatch the originals. So disappointing. It's like someone described how to make a star wars movie to an alien, and then the alien tried writing and directing his own. Between this movie and the recent EA game, my love for star wars has taken a beating, and it really sucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There is no point in destroying the Empire and killing the Emperor at the end of Return of the Jedi. It destroys Luke's legacy and completely kills any reason to watch future films in the franchise.<br/><br/>In this regard, it is worse than the Prequel trilogy since while those were terrible films, they did not destroy the franchise.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7878617"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Before going to see TLJ today I was slightly disappointed/nervous at the audience score on aggregators such as Metacritic. I thought, "What could fans hate so much that some stoop to the level of likening it to The Phantom Menace?" Now that I have seen the film (and read through many comments from people who both liked and/or disliked TLJ) I will give my reaction in full.<br/><br/>To state it simply: I really enjoyed TLJ. Why? The visuals, the practical effects, the shocking moments, the action scenes (the fight in Snoke's chamber and the action on Crait were very exciting), the acting (particularly Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver), the intuitive nature of the dialogue (I'll also add that "Darkness rises, and light to meet it" is one of the coolest lines of dialogue I can remember).<br/><br/>Were there things I didn't like? Of course - but they're small. I'll talk briefly about my top three issues. First, I thought that there were pacing issues. There was one moment in particular that was more of an editing issue where one scene jumped almost abruptly to the next. Second, some of the humor was present at times where I thought it shouldn't be (even though I thought that pretty much every line that was meant to be funny was worth at least a chuckle). Third, (and I think this has something to do with TLJ being the second film in the sequel trilogy) I felt that this episode could have been it's own stand-alone movie, that it wasn't a sequel to TFA. The only things that connected it to TFA are Rey's journey to find Luke and Kylo's struggle with the Light.<br/><br/>Now let me address my views on some of the more dividing moments:<br/><br/>Let me get two things out of the way quickly. First, Leia's moment where she floats back to the ship. Strange? Very much so. This is one of those moments in the film where Rian Johnson took a chance. I understand the explanation for it (Leia is Force-sensitive), but I think that the film would have been as good without it or if it had been filmed differently. So I guess in that instance I'm 50/50. The other criticism I want to bypass quickly is that some people have labeled TLJ "childish". This is nonsense. If you didn't know Star Wars was made for children then do some research.<br/><br/>Here are my feelings surrounding Finn's story-line. I've seen a few people dismiss it as "unnecessary" because they [Finn and Rose] didn't end up completing their objective. Am I the only one who found it more appealing that they didn't complete their objective? Having them succeed would have felt too ordinary to me. Also I have heard people say that the character DJ was a waste of time. I would mostly agree. It's sad too, because I actually enjoy characters like DJ. I wish he would've been used in a different manner. Unfortunately, subtracting DJ from the plot renders the scenes on Canto Bight null. This is also sad because there was some great action scenes here. Now, I have tried to reconcile this. I find some plausibility that in a real life scenario, heading into uncharted waters means that things will not always go as planned. Finn and Rose went to Canto Bight to find the codebreaker but end up getting captured. They then break out with DJ's (and BB-8's) help, only to get on board the Supremacy and have DJ turn on them. Also, it’s important to mention that the children we see on Canto Bight are important to the last scene of the film, so there’s that.<br/><br/>Now let's discuss Luke. Yes it is different that someone like Luke would struggle with fear and failure after what we witnessed him do in Ep. IV-VI, especially at the end of ROTJ where he ultimately proclaimed himself a Jedi and shunned the Dark Side. Fast forward to TLJ, we find out that Luke has changed. He clearly cared deeply for his nephew Ben. Such emotion can illicit strong reactions. I think it was made clear in TLJ that Luke was disappointed with his actions, that's why he went into exile. He realizes that he made the wrong choice back when he considered killing Ben. He feels responsible (as I've heard Mark Hamill say) for Ben's fall to the Dark Side.<br/><br/>The death of Snoke I certainly did not see coming. How it happened was, I think, the most shocking part. Was Snoke a powerful Force-user? Apparently so. Should he have noticed the lightsaber moving next to him? I thought he would while I was watching it, but now thinking back I don't think it's hard to imagine Snoke being so transfixed in the moment that even if he had reacted he would have still been killed. Am I disappointed that we didn't learn more about Snoke's background? Yes, I am. That being said, Ep. IX has yet to be made. I'm pretty sure Snoke will be mentioned in IX.<br/><br/>To sum up, I will say it is the nature of the plot of any film/novel for people to both like it and others to hate it. Still, I think that a lot of the criticisms of TLJ are premature.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Sure, I get that failure is the big theme here and even legends can fail, but they did in a way that was astronomically out of character. Luke doesn't turn his back on people. Even if he goes emo because of his failure with Kylo, is that supposed to be traumatic enough to let the whole universe suffer as he tries to go into hiding forever? Nonsense. His 'conversion' scene is also dumb. Rey says I believe in you, and all of a sudden Luke has his conviction again. Completely unearned. But even when he does come back, it's another example of misdirection as he literally does nothing the audience hopes he will do. Rogue One had the Vader scene that blew the roof off the house. We want to cheer for our Star Wars characters!! This movie refused to portray Luke as anything other than an old man ready to die. So infuriating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not a single question was answered and everything built before this episode was not crushed, but ignored. Rian Johnson has either never seen a Star Wars movie or willfully decided to disappoint as many people as he could simultaneously. Snoke is nothing. Luke is nothing. Leia is Mary Poppins. Han died for nothing. I believe that Disney wants to eliminate the idea of heroes and villains and instead champion an idea that anyone can save the day even if you are not trained or skilled (example: Rose is a mechanic who works on pipes, but can also fly a fighter or Rey has trained for 2 days with a lightsaber and now she can defeat Snoke's elite guards) Overall terrible and yes I am salty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7878549"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I was impressed with the character development. Kylo was less angsty and a more manipulative, deceitful villain yet I still felt sympathetic for him. Poe was somewhere between brash and brave. Finn and Rose learn an important lesson in trusting strangers in a great sub plot that reminded me of a Flannery O'Conner short story. Luke has always been angry, and it seems now he's channelled it into his obsession with regret. He resolved his oedipal complex in return of the jedi and was becoming a pacifist, which I thought Rian Johnson maintained in a clever way at the end, but I think for real closure I wanted him to resolve his anger problems. The conflict between Kylo and Rey is great when they forcetime each other but she needs more character development. Her character is a little bland and needs some salt- maybe from that planet with all the salt. And I wish Leia was more sarcastic. But maybe she's older and wiser now. I liked the david and goliath plot line of the rebel fleet on the run. Their situation becomes more and more dire until the fleet is reduced to hiding out using junk speeders to fight. I became afraid for the characters, I saw they were afraid, which is basic and crucial for an adventure story yet missing in the force awakens. (That movie felt to me like an encore presentation of star wars in the form of improv hosted by han solo.) However the whole point of the david and goliath story is for something big to happen at the end, which is where Last Jedi seemed to peter out. It just drags on unsure of when to stop. That was my big issue with the pacing. Great dialogue. Nailed the sound of the Jedi, clever one liners, yet didn't quite nail the star wars sense of humor.  It's more character based, about sarcasm and cockiness, the shakespearean irony of two people flirting by insulting each other, cute child archetypes in the form of droids, droid/human misunderstandings. And the bad guys never make you laugh. Cinematography was well composed, I know Johnson was influenced by the Russian film Letter Never Sent, great restraint on lightsaber fights, thank god no death star and I hope disney wont put two in the next one to make up for it. I missed the influence of Campbell and the monomyth. Had big hopes for Johnson in this regard. Hero with 1000 faces seems to have been milked dry anyway but maybe there are other Jungian/Freudian psychology books that can influence this next trilogy. Or I could always rewatch A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I don't think I need to write a 5,000 character to let you know what I feel. This review wont truly be spoiling the movie but there are hints in this review about what happens in the movie.<br/><br/>If you are watching Star Wars the Last Jedi because you want to see the older characters like Luke, Han Solo..etc, you are in for a disappointment. It's clear, this movie has been given a new director. This new director is practically throwing out all the old characters in a very disrespectful way. It's clear they want to start something new and they only used the old characters to help start this new path. While it's fine to do this, it's not good to disrespect some characters that people have grown up 40+ years with. Going back to my point, this new director is clearly trying to make a new direction for this movie. Gone are a lot of the subplots that the Force Awaken hinted and started. Gone are a lot of characters that have started.  Gone is the main point of "Star Wars".<br/><br/>The movie is also trying too hard to be move funny like Marvel Studios does with it. The jokes/humor do not fit in this tone. There are way too many plot holes and very questionable character motives. Regardless, the final act (last 30 minutes) is where the movie just falls apart with character motives, plot holes, disrespecting characters, dropping subplots..etc<br/><br/><br/>Garbage movie. If this did not carry the Star Wars name, it would be butchered by critics. Instead, it carries Star Wars so they must give it a high score. 4/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

She had no character development in the last movie and she was skilled in everything. In the last Jedi it was more of the same with still no explanation. Don't even ask me about the huge plot holes.

A defeated, half-baked, wise kenobi archetype that hardly was what kenobi was to luke. Rey's dialogue with luke felt forced, repetitive, and non creative. Snoke's back story ignored.  Rey's backstory throwing into the trash. Kylo is the same jerkw ad with the same temperment that has hardly grown AT ALL from the first movie. SO much missed opportunity for back story growth, canon progression, and creative story telling.... but it completely flopped and again fed on nostalgic moments from the original.... There are redditors out there with story writing capablities 100x that of the team behind this movie... all in all 3/10... another overhyped, nostalgic, and overproduced underwritten film. damn shame :(.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It was the first time I saw an audience cheer when the hero came to save the day at the end, then five minutes later, hang their head and leave the theater in silence. The jyst of almost every comment I heard (and these were the die-hard Star Wars lovers) was 'How could they do this to us'. One girl next to me was saying, 'Oh my God. Oh my God. I can't believe this. That movie killed Star Wars'.<br/>I couldn't have summed this movie up better. Here's why: The reviews lie to the public. Even IMDB. If you read their plot synopsis, it reads 'Rey develops her newly acquired abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker.'  WRONG! Luke REFUSES to train her. In fact, he refuses to train any Jedi and wants to see the Jedi die out. Apparently he has spent twenty years trying to train people to be Jedi, but when he discovers that Kylo Ren has too much of the Dark Side in him, he wants to KILL Kylo instead of saving and mentoring him. After Kylo escapes Luke's wrath, Luke goes to a Jedi temple and broods for another ten years over his failure, refuses to have anything to do with the Rebel cause and decides he wants to isolate himself there until he dies! I am not making this up! Yes, the same Luke who rose up to become a hero for the Rebellion, destroyed the Death Star, killed Darth Vader and dedicated himself to restoring freedom to the galaxy,apparently now wants to run his lightsaber through his own nephew, wants nothing to do with the Rebellion even as his sister begs him for their very survival, and wants to hang out on an island, milking the **** of some alien on the beach and watching little aliens running around doing his laundry (these scenes ARE IN THE MOVIE! I kid you not!) and brood about his failures until he dies.<br/>Sorry. This is not the Luke Skywalker that Star Wars fans know and love. This is bad writing to get rid of another beloved character in favor of Disney's new vision. How dare they. The writing. Atrocious. Remember the Battle Of Hoth In Empire Strikes Back? Well, you can watch a poorly staged, thinned out version of it at the end of this movie. Only wait. It isn't snow this time. It's salt! That means its totally different, right? But we've still got snow walkers and rebels in a trench with their guns, right?<br/>And remember when Lando and the Rebels took on the Imperial Fleet at the end of Return Of The Jedi? That's here too. Only now, you don't need 50 Rebel ships to take out a Star Destroyers 15 laser cannons. All you need is Poe Dameron and one X-Wing fighter to take them out. He's THAT good.<br/>And did you know that when Jedis die, it doesn't matter now because they can just come back to life as ghosts and interact with the living world te way they always did when they were alive? Yup, Rian Johnson the director apparently thinks so. Thus, Yoda can burn old Jedi texts and light fire to Jedi Temples. Now that we know this, it doesn't matter that Luke dies at the end of this movie. Rian Johnson can bring him back as though nothing happened in the next movie. By this new logic, hell, lets bring back Obiwan and Darth Vader and Quigon Jin and Samuel L. Jackson and heck, why not ALL the old Jedis. I could go on and on with examples like this.<br/>And for those of you waiting for a climactic lightsaber duel, when you go, pay attention to the terribly choreographed duel between Kylo and Rey and Snoke's Elite Guards. It is laughable. The scene more akin to a ballet with missed steps than it is to a violent sword fight. See it, then tell me I am wrong. It is embarrassing. And it is all on director Rian Johnson's shoulders.<br/>This movie is an insult to the original trilogy and is an insult to every intelligent Star Wars fan out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7877980"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">STAR WARS FANS ARE TEARING THIS FILM APART. And rightly so.<br/><br/>The Last Jedi was a fun movie. It had everything you'd want to see in a blockbuster: goal-driven characters, a great musical score, and explosive action. And yes, BB-9e and the Porgs were clearly made for merchandise, but so were the Ewoks so it's not like Lucasfilm hasn't milked the cash cow before. But I left the theater discontent. Here's why:<br/><br/>The Last Jedi did not add much depth to the Force Awakens. In the end of TFA, there's a real gray area in Kylo's future. I got the feeling there was still light in young Ben. By the end of TLJ, it's completely snuffed out. He's not a complex character anymore. He's just a very one-dimensional baddie. Even his mom knows he's a goner. There's a real problem with this conclusion, however. The whole movie hints at hope in Kylo. Rey senses it. After Luke was honest with Rey, the audience can tell that there's a misunderstanding between master and apprentice. An internal conflict still exists within him. That is, until his betrayal to Snoke. Then, Kylo transforms into the blandest character ever. Quite comparable to Steppenwolf from the DCEU's failed team-up movie. I wanted so badly to invest in the villain, but I couldn't after Luke's lightsaber was torn apart.<br/><br/>And then there's Snoke. I understand maybe Rian Johnson didn't think he was very important to the plot, but his quick exit was a bad idea. There was so much potential with his character, but nope. All wasted. It just sucks to wait a whole year for the build up just to see him go so soon. I do admit, the way he died was pretty cool, but at least give him a backstory. Star Wars fans go crazy after that. And after the countless Snoke theories that accumulated over the past couple years, I can't imagine how the writers of this film got together and said, "Do you know what would be cool? If Snoke just died without a backstory. I'm sure fans would eat that **** up." Well guess what, we didn't.<br/><br/>So Mark Hamill didn't like Johnson's direction on Luke Skywalker. I HATED WHAT JOHNSON DID TO LUKE. First of all, his disbelief that Ben Solo couldn't be saved from the dark side? Darth Vader admitted himself that Luke was the one who turned him good again. So why couldn't he have talked with his nephew and had a flat out family discussion with him. Yeah, he may have been impulsive in the original trilogy, but you'd think Luke would have learned by now what his being like 60 years old and all. Second, Luke as a hermit... doesn't really fit his character. The prequel trilogy lay the grounds for why Yoda could make a good hermit. He's hella wise. Luke, on the other hand, has always been a fighter. He did not of that in this film. And if you say I'm wrong because of the scene with Kylo, he just dodged Kylo's lightsaber a couple times. And then he dies, no wait. That's just hologram Luke. No wait. He's dead. GG Luke, you thought too hard you had a brain aneurysm. If you thought Snoke's potential was wasted, Luke had like 10x the potential, and it was also wasted. TLJ did nothing to further the elements of TFA. There was nothing riveting in the story, nothing new that we didn't already know, just a jumbled up mess. There were things I enjoyed. I liked Rose. I thought she was a great character who really stood by her morals. I gotta say, I'm Asian American and I did appreciate the fact that Star Wars has become more and more diversified. If any fans complain against diversity in Star Wars they are just racist. So, good on Lucasfilm and Disney for that I guess. And great job by Kelly Marie Tran. Benicio del Toro is in this film, which is a plus...<br/><br/>If this was a standalone film, I might have given it a higher score. But this is Star Wars. And it did not feel like a Star Wars film.<br/><br/>Captain Phasma was also wasted. You know what, Johnson took like the three most visually compelling characters in this film and killed them off... I'm actually pissed thinking about it right now. Good luck JJ Abrams. You're going to need it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

While it did borrow a lot of it's feel (and a little of it's plot) from the Empire Strikes Back, the main arc of the story was great.  The side-plots were serviceable.   I left feeling some closure to the old guard.  Seeing Carrie Fisher's last performance was worth the price of admission alone.  Her brief scene with Mark Hamill left it's mark, and more importantly it passed the torch to the new generation.   It somehow made The Force Awakens better.  There were some questionable decisions made on how the Force works - and even though it's explain still in simple Yoda like terms, I left the theater thinking the Force is as mysterious as ever.   Looking forward to the final part in this trilogy, much better than the prequels.  I rank this film #3 on my list of best Star Wars,  my favorite episodes in order:  Empire Strikes Back, Rouge One, The Last Jedi, A New Hope, Revenge of the Sith, Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens, Attack of the Clones, Phantom Menace</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Poor character develope in addition to more useless characters and poorly timed humor. If that wasn't bad there was a nonstop touch and go with this film, middle of action and cut to a close up of characters whispering. Just get to the point, this film beat around the bush and I honestly started to feel bored in a starwars film. Yes you read it literally bored. Might I also add that everything is just getting ridiculous looking in scale, snokes command ship is like the opening scene from space balls, starwars has managed to parody a parody of itself. Speaking of useless characters snoke has become just that in this film, a tool that could have been absolutely amazing has become a useless under developed bad guy again. Speaking of which this film almost entirely takes place in space and hardly has ground elements so your stuck looking at the same volley of bombardment from this useless gigantic capital ship and no other first order ships can come and intercept them? Your telling me the bad guys who have practically taken back the Galaxy can't send a ship to cut them off. Finn was great, his supporting actress was useless and not as an actress just as a character, it was horrible she and snoke are jar jar worthy. Rey, well, likeable as always and she has kept the stiff unsure of herself approach but adorable as always. Carrie Fisher was spot on and awesome. Luke's character hardly had a decent role but when he was there it was great, for the first film being all about finding Luke they really under utilized him as a character in this film. Captain phasma, again completely useless and honestly I don't want to get flak for this but it's seriously just an equality role, just another useless strong female for a film that gets under utilized, should be cut entirely. Much like the female admiral who I cannot remember, that's how useless and under developed she was, she takes control of the ship and if they WOULDNT HAVE KILLED AKBAR he could have easily been in control, like really why introduce some new character that has no arc from previous films when you have the opportunity to utilize a fan favorite, like again just an equality actor. So what are my final thoughts well if you like episode 1 and 2 "prequals" then this is the film for you, this is my least favorite starwars film that was all visual and no substance. Rogue one was better.... Just saying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Last Jedi is not what I expected. At all. And it's all the better for it.<br/><br/>Rian Johson has decided to approach the character of Luke Skywalker with shades of gray; gone is the hero that we remember from the original trilogy. In his place stands a man who has been broken down by experiences that have caused him to question the hubris and claim to moral authority that defined the Jedi Order. He's reluctant, skeptical, and everything in between. In short, he's more interesting than he's ever been.<br/><br/>Likewise, Johnson and company have summarily shattered our expectations of how things will play out in the traditional good vs. evil battle that has defined the Star Wars universe since... well... forever. I don't want to give too much away, but there are some plot turns that unfold here that were--for me--totally unexpected. For the first time in a long time I was kept on my toes throughout the duration of a Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>In short, this latest entry pushes the lore and mythos of Star Wars in new directions. It challenges preconceived notions of how it should all play out. That will (and apparently has) make some people angry, but I loved the unpredictability of it all. Still, The Last Jedi isn't perfect. The way Finn and the new character Rose are handled feels a little flat and diversionary, and I wish there was just a bit more pay-off in some crucial moments. Still, the freshness of this--and the sheer awesomeness of the various conflicts as they unfold--makes this one of the best Star Wars entries. There are some fantastic call-backs to the original trilogy that I don't want to give away, but they carry as much emotional weight as the new and unexpected revelations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Last Jedi takes the franchise in the right path, managing to give us a wider understanding of the Galaxy and putting the character's humanity at its core.

The author (Chris Agar) concludes that "Lucasfilm is constantly in a lose-lose situation" and will never be able to please everyone because they will be accused of copying the original SW films, or else they will incur the wrath of fans by departing from tradition. I'm not sure I agree - in fact, this "lose-lose" business feels a lame excuse that gets Disney off the hook for making bad films. Furthermore, it is a false choice fallacy to suggest that the studio must choose between copying the OT or doing something new. If Disney would simply give the world a good story that is true to the original spirit of the originals, they would win the adoration of the fans forever.<br/><br/>Look at how enthusiastically fans embraced The Force Awakens and Rogue One, both of which were decidedly mediocre. In other words, it ain't that hard. Yet somehow Disney messed this up. Big Time.<br/><br/>Sadly, there is already a veritable circling of the media wagons in defense of this film. The narrative that many in the media are embracing is that audience critics of TLJ are either disaffected fanboys unwilling to broaden their palate, or perhaps they are simply bigots who cannot tolerate a more diverse approach to the franchise.<br/><br/>But what if - WHAT IF - audiences hate The Last Jedi because it is a bad film? Surely we can admit that possibility?<br/><br/>The fact that we can't speaks to both the inherent confirmation biases in the media (anyone who doesn't think TLJ was graded on an extremely generous curve may be a touch naive) and Disney's shrewd exploitation of these biases. Surely a property like Star Wars gets the corporate treatment...these are not "autuer" films, no matter what the Disney marketing machine would have us believe. In short, Disney knew what they were doing when they decided to make a social statement with casting and story decisions. Like the Ghostbusters reboot, the Disney Star Wars films were always going to be embraced by the critics. Clearly, virtue Signaling is a temptation that very few people in that milieu can resist.<br/><br/>As for the film, others have underlined it's staggering weaknesses better than I can (poor pacing, lack of character development, nonsensical plotting, highfalutin social commentary, weak dialogue, punishingly stupid jokes, and unidiomatic tone) - simply put this is a 40 lbs turkey served cold. Remember that fans embraced The Force Awakens and Rogue One, neither of which is anywhere near as good as even the worst of the originals. All Disney needed to do here was make a halfway competent film. The backlash is because with all their vast resources, they couldn't even manage that.<br/><br/>When I was a senior in high school we had a math teacher who was extremely generous with granting opportunities for extra credit, and even went so far as to allow us to approach her with questions ask during tests. She knew that a lot of us had gotten acceptance letters from colleges and didn't want anyone to catch such a bad case of Senioritis that it would screw-up our future...she used to remind us that it wasn't hard to get a passing grade in her class - but you had to put in the effort, or she would have no mercy on you. Really, all you had to do was care.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Snoke's backstory is excluded from the story, Rey's parents are irrelevant, and where are the knights of ren, huh? And that one scene at the start (i think you all know the one) is just so weird and unnecessary. It trivialises the 'force' and is just so awkward. Without spoiling anything, it just makes no sense in the context of the rest of the film if they come back, and its worse for episode 9 because now they can't solve that problem either which would have been conveniently solved had the scene been followed-through with, its a mess. Its near the same level as batman v superman martha scene. There is zero depth in this film, sure the action sequences were perfect but its without substance, all flash. Humour was alright, but even that felt a little too obvious and unnatural compared to harrison ford and ewan mcgregor days. And it stems from a typical disney problem where characters are too superficially fantastical (i think only Poe and Rey had adequate character development).<br/><br/>Honestly can't believe they're getting rian jhonson to direct a new trilogy this film is so bad. Rotten tomato user reviews already dropped 30% and IMDB is hammering it now - can't believe critics are still holding at 90%+ when this film is a failure to fans.<br/><br/>Even if you suspend reasonable disbelief at certain points, the story is such a mess that every significant plot point is of no significance to the overall story - In situations where there are two paths to the story being developed, neither path is followed through with and you get half-assed compromises that are indeed suprisingly bad. What you're left with is a big mess that JJ Abrhams has to clean up in episode 9. If they had followed through with even some of the themes being touched upon like politics, morality, greed, and power then this film would at least have some substance and value to literature but none of those themes get shown in a way that makes you think about it, rather they are artificially injected in typical Disney fashion and not a integral part of the central story - like most things in this film, such themes are disposable rather than deeply ingrained in the story. Which is not the good marks of any valuable film. It would probably take Christopher Nolan to save the next installment, i'm not sure that JJ Abhrams can do it. This review gives 1 point for continuing the star wars story. And another 1 point for marketing intrigue across mainstream culture; even if it's for worse than better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I imagine the recipe for such "brilliance" was to pack a room with progressive liberals and focus-group them until death do us part. This resulted in a final product empowering all the right groups (think Hillary and Angela Merkel as rebel commanders) and dishing out justice to dumb-ass, testosterone-filled dirt bags (Luke Skywalker included).

This movie was full of questionable character choices, side plots that felt like huge wastes of time, and questionable uses of "the force". Not only does it leave you with almost as many questions as the previous movie, but there really is no character development for anyone except maybe Kylo Ren. Can we get some explanation as to why Rey is automatically such a prodigy with the force? Can she ever go through some sort of inner turmoil or any sort of loss or obstacle? I feel like the people who made this movie didn't even watch the original three, there is absolutely no parallels anymore. You could say that is a risk, but I'd say it was just a poor choice. Everything has been undermined.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

TLJ is superior to TFA. It is far, far from perfect, but no SW film ever was. Yes, there is abundance of silliness (Leia floating in space taking the prize for perhaps the most ludicrous moment of perhaps the entire franchise), but unlike TFA, this one dared to take risks and has managed its characters far better (both new and old). With Abrams in charge of Episode IX, the franchise is still not safe from ruin, but with this TLJ it gets to live another day</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Didnt they learn from the 1st one that they need to push the story forward instead of making a C grade retelling the old stories? Wow, so glad I didnt pay to watch this.<br/><br/>1st of all, the replacement characters remain unlikable because dialog and character building is poor. Attempts at humor are not funny nor charming, and the plot development might as well be written by someone with a high school level intellect. Plot holes abound in what is sadly yet another attempt at a retelling of the same story from the 80s... how you can make more plot holes in a story remake? Well they did. and they threw in a few eye rolls as Rei continues to be a lore destroying super Jedi that has more power than all the previous Jedi combined without even trying and barely any training. The sensitive storm trooper who didnt want to kill can now kill as many of his brethren while smiling. And oh apparently the rebel are now so dumb that they dont even consider looking around for an exit when they are trapped until the magnificent leader says they should look around and after asking Lea if its ok to look around with him... lol. Luke who is supposedly a master Jedi at this stage in his like, is now the guy who either died due to being out of shape or by a 3rd rate sith dork who lost storm trooper in melee combat. But he he sure fooled him for a minute to allow a group of worthless idiots escape... I guess this was his Obiwan moment when he went up against a full powered Darth Vader and had no chance of winning... except in Lukes case it was against a kitten with the IQ of a wet towel. They basically took a dump on all three original movies (and even the prequels if you care about those) as well as all the written lore that came after not to mention common sense. Luke got killed while projecting his hologram... why? To give the rebels time to escape when all they had to do was look around for an exit and shoot themselves out. But they were too dumb to figure that out. It took sacrificing Luke (who didnt actually need to die, he could have pulled out the second they started looking for an exit) and Rei to move a few rocks to do what would have been trivial with the guns and equipment the rebels had with them. And all this happened why? Because they ran out of gas lol.<br/><br/>Good bye Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Kermode even liked it, I can't understand.  On almost every level this movie is a train wreck.  .<br/>.<br/>Where to begin.  Ok, so there's a moment of continuity failure that was so bad I actually had to turn the person next to me to confirm I hadn't had a stroke, blacked out for 10 minutes and missed a section of the film.  One moment Rey is on Snoke's flagship and the next she's somehow on the Millennium Falcon.  It's bad, really, really bad.  .<br/>.<br/>And that's the problem with this film - there are countless, and I do mean countless, moments like that.  I'll try and pick out a few which haven't gotten a mention on these user comments.  Luke Skywalker appears to have developed a severe form of schizophrenia.  While much has been written about how he displays none of the virtues of OT character, what confused me more was the total lack of logical consistency of the character we were presented here.  There's a scene where he literally lights a flare and walks up a set of steps intent on burning down the original Jedi temple, complete with the Jedi texts (a MacGuffian that actually hold absolutely no purpose in the film making this an utterly meaningless gesture).  He then hesitates and Yoda, who appears for no other reason, blows up the treebased temple with a lightening strike.  Now forget how incredible dumb this is.  How there are any number of countless other moments in time where it would have been fortuitous for Yoda to appeared as a deux ex machina to save the day with this completely ludicrous ability.  No, banish that piece of **** story writing, instead focus on Luke having a full on schizophrenic episode and immediately mourning the loss of the sacred texts which he moments earlier was on a mission to destroy himself.  I can only assume he now suffers from an undiagnosed, DSM V definable mental condition.<br/><br/>What else?  On there's mountains, absolute mountains of stuff.  Pit of Sarlacc sized plot holes.  So they're chasing the remains of the Resistance fleet .... ok.  Why not hyperspace jump ahead of them and close the net?  Basic, basic stuff.  Primary school level stuff.  Why not launch your Tie-Fighters?  These are capital ships.  In modern warfare it's like saying the aircraft carrier could outrun the F-18 fighter jets that it hosts ..... basic, basic stuff.  .<br/>.<br/>What else?  Ok so I'll close with the Snoke issue.  So forget that he has no back story.  Forget that all those threads, that in retrospect where actually quite well constructed in The Force Awakens, were cut abruptly short.  Ignore the fact that Snoke literally claims that he read minds and has demonstrated this power minutes earlier.  Ignore it all.  Instead focus on how Rian Johnson has left the director of Episode 9 completely screwed.  The big bad is gone, replaced with a whinging emo child.  While Driver deserves the least amount of abuse for the work he's put in, his character is a sad joke.  Till the end Palpatine and Vader were unquestionably capable.  Deserved of the respect they they commanded.  Undeniably the end bosses of the series.  Kylo Ren on the other hand has been systematically owned by almost every character in Episode 7 and 8.  He barely saw off Finn at the end The Force Awakens.  Snoke shamed him infront Rey and his elite guard.  Rey smacked him around with zero training.  Luke basically gives him the finger in the final confrontation, which wasn't actually a confrontation.  Until Snoke's death, even General Hux commands more respect than him in the First Order. .<br/>.<br/>He is a near constant failure.  He is ... Christopher Moltisanti from The Sopranos.  He is the family **** up.  .<br/>.<br/>Indeed his facial scar is a constantly remainder of how weak he is .... but he's the big bad we've got to look forward to in Episode 9.  In the pantheon of great villians, while people will for decades speak of Vader in the same breath as the Id from Forbidden Planet, Hans Grubber and Hannibal Lecter, Kylo Ren comes in about as credible as Arnold's Mr Freeze from Batman & Robin and as capable as the two dumb dumbs from Home Alone.  .<br/>.<br/>It's now very clear why Colin Trevorrow was let go from directing Episode 9.  He clearly rocked the boat by pointing out what a cluster**** he was inheriting from Johnson.  I never thought I'd say this but JJ Abrams has my sincerest sympathies.  While after watching The Force Awakens I left the cinema enraged because of the unoriginality of simply ripped off Episode 4, at least it was well made and setup future movies.  It felt like a Star Wars movie, a near scene for scene, dialogue for dialogue rip of A New Hope, but a Star Wars movie all the same.  The Last Jedi however kills the saga in its tracks.  .<br/>.<br/>I say this with tears in my eyes and vomit in my throat but ... the prequels were better constructed, more coherent and added more to the saga than this monstrosity of a film.  It really is a dreadful mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

He took an incredibly complex plot, fraught with a lot of potentially cliche and dull as hell story possibilities and steered the series back on course. In fact, it was done over and above expectations by making amends for the previous movie sins commited in the "Force Awakens." While the movie was full of a few too many last minute saves it didn't to my best recollection step to the depth of paradoxal coincidence. there were one or two unexpected twists, but this is the first of the major series I've actually enjoyed (excluding Rogue One in particular) since Return of the Jedi. I am suspect that this may be a one off as I don't fully trust Disney in the least. However, you don't have to agree with me or any of the other reviewers. just take a look at the long lines at the theatres...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Last Jedi was a refreshing change of pace in the new trilogy that was sheer brilliance. While the Force Awakens was a disappointingly conservative complete rehash of the original trilogy, TLJ used some artistic license to make changes and take risks, and it paid off. If you are looking for a story told in an archetype fashion, you will not enjoy something so new and different. There are still recurring themes of light, dark, force, family, struggle, and balance that make this a Star Wars classic, but the creativity and change in the movie are inspiring to say the least, such as the visuals, settings, and story.<br/><br/>Some great examples: The silent scene of Holdo sending a ship through another ship was Gravity-esque brilliant. Benicio is always fantastic, and his random inclusion in a subplot (ie NOT the master coder) rightfully shows that a story doesn't always have to follow a simple linear path. Rey's alliance becomes questionable. The story is never overly predictable, leaving many different avenues open. It also gives you a lot to think about, such as Benicio's revelation that many don't draw a simple line between good guys and bad guys.<br/><br/>I was surprised and disappointed by the low user scores/reviews. I feel like unlike most of them, this movie had substance. Summary of bad user reviews:<br/>-Luke's character defiled (blasphemy!)<br/>I get it, it was a bit disappointing to see him not be the true master we all expected. But realize that there is no perfect character, and a temporary lapse in judgement is reasonable. Honestly, I feel like he was never really a well developed multi-dimensional character anyways, at least until now (blasphemy!)<br/><br/>-Soulessly sets up for selling toys/games/licensing<br/>You kidding? Have you seen the original Star Wars? Where wookies, ewoks, walkers, x-wings, planets, etc were invented? In fact, many walkers and ships were reused here, not much innovation there. And Star Wars has always been about creativity. I really appreciate the work in showing us new worlds and creatures, such as the casino planet (compare it to the original trilogy's cantina)<br/><br/>-Silly humor in this new trilogy<br/>Again, refer to the original trilogy (R2D2, C-3PO, Chewbaca, etc). I thought the clothes iron scene was hilarious. If you think this movie was cringy, complain about Marvel movies.<br/><br/>-Political agenda: too much emphasis on minority/different characters, white men are portrayed badly<br/>I can kinda see how there does seem to be some political undertones in this, but this mostly just comes off as crying to me. Surely they produced this before it became Trump's 'merica, so hopefully they will "fix" this by whitewashing the cast in the next movie.<br/><br/>-Didn't like Luke milking a cow or other creatures on his island<br/>Well how else is he supposed to get calcium? Seriously, I saw this in a number of reviews lol<br/><br/>-Porgs == Jar Jar<br/>Absolutely absurd to compare them, Jar Jar was an important character that diminished the graveness of scenes. Porgs had a small "role" in only a few scenes.<br/><br/>-Something, something, Disney/corporate defilement/cash grab<br/>Pretty incoherent arguments here, can't really find a thesis behind them, but some just seem to hate Disney. They took the franchise in a different direction, move on.<br/><br/>-Too different from original star wars, I saw/grew up with the original movies, Star Wars is my religion, I'm not ready for change, etc<br/>Bingo. Can't argue with you on that, but if you want blissful nostalgia, watch TFA or the original trilogy again<br/><br/>Finally, while I loved the movie, a few things I was slightly disturbed by:<br/>-Leia space scene was a bit of a stretch, still cool tho<br/>-Rey overpowered w/little to no training<br/>-Emperor Snoke extremely powerful but defeated very easily + who was he?<br/>-Luke wants to end the jedi, then at the end says they'll still live on?<br/>-Luke vanished :( why?! (issues behind the scenes?!)<br/>-Finn+Poe+Rose subplot seemingly pointless, but still a refreshing unexpected plot change<br/>-Still haven't seen any Jedi mind tricks! :p<br/><br/>TLJ's theme of wiping out the past and moving on is perhaps a reflection of the nostalgia that people hold onto in justifying keeping star wars movies repetitive boring rehashes. Sorry guys, but let the past die. Kill it if you have to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If you go into it with no expectations, it's one of the best movies you will ever see. The movie doesn't do what you think and in that sense is very refreshing for a Star Wars film. I love that Rey is a "nobody". I love Poe's plan didn't work out. I love that they didn't blow up a death star thing. It doesn't follow the Star Wars script like Force Awakens or Rogue One (the worst Star Wars movie ever made), in that theres isn't a space battle, a light saber fight, and a land battle all going on at once. It's refreshing and a must see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Well, you can forget about all of that, because this movie trades all those wonderful things for Disney sitcom-tier humour and quips, boring meaningless space battles, no heart and soul, total disrespect of the lore and characters that George Lucas had created, uninteresting villains, plot holes galore, and a chase plot reminiscent of Battlestar Galactica.<br/><br/>In short, this movie was a MESS. I can't believe I'm typing this, but it's worse than Force Awakens. At least JJ stayed true to the tone of Star Wars. I don't know what Rian Johnson and Disney were trying to accomplish with this absolute train wreck of a movie. It's time to accept Star Wars died when George Lucas sold the franchise to Disney.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Pienso que a muchos les molestaron los giros pero creo que eran necesarios para que la película se sintiese fresca y no como un refrito de la trilogía Original o como que apelaban a las teorías de los fans, los efectos visuales son asombrosos eso si se usa un poco mas el CGI pero no molesta, la comedia tal vez sea el punto mas feo de la película no tengo problemas con chistes o bromas ya que se usan desde la trilogía original pero estos son malisimos a tal punto que se sienten super forzados. Una película fresca de Star Wars que soluciona muchos fallos de el episodio VII y que apesar de contar con fanservice este no entorpece la trama o la vuelve un calco de episodios pasados, veanla y tengan sus propias conclusiones yo la disfrute y hasta llore con lo emotivo que se vuelve.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Disney has completely disrespected the originals and concocted a big money grab for their pockets. I have never written a review on a movie however I feel I need to for this. If you loved the originals, you probably fell in love with watching Luke, Leia, Han Solo, Chewie, R2-D2 and C3PO. They had prominent roles that heavily contributed to the feeling of Star Wars. We fell in love with the characters. I didn't feel attached to the characters in TLJ. Felt as if everyone was thrown into a grinder to let them blend as best they could. Forced humour just took the piss. They killed off Luke as if he was nothing. He barely played a role. Leia, flying through space like superman? WTF? She wasn't trained in the force yet she can do that? Snoke can't even see/feel a lightsaber moving next to him and he's some super powerful force wielding bad guy? Who is Snoke? Cheap Porgs? Cant Disney come up with quality ideas for battles.? The end scene of this felt like Empire Strikes Back on Hoth, Disney tried hard here, it really did. It sucked. They did the same thing with TFA, with the attack on the StarKiller like A New Hopes attack on the Death Star and Return of the Jedi, where Lando and the X-Wing fighter fly into the centre to take out the Death Star from within. TFA wasn't the best, however it left the door open for an incredible sequel. TLJ could have answered a lot of questions. There is so much crap to write its unbearable to think about. Sh*t acting...Throw a touch of "cultural diversity" in. Asian girl and a black man run around trying to save everyone. There is another post on MC, very well said, along the lines of, all white men are bad and women are superior. Almost felt as if there was a feminist movement going on. What about a send off for Carrie Fisher in the end credits like Fast and the Furious did for Paul Walker?<br/>Disney you have destroyed it. No doubt you lined your pockets deep. In the end thats all that mattered to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's a very interesting movie that usurps your expectations and hopes but does it in a way that makes sense. Movie critics seem to love it. After seeing it, I thought fans we're going to be more divided. This ended up being the case. I think this is because while the movie is not disrespectful to Star Wars, it is not overly reverent. It does not bow to fan theories or the fanfics theorists created in their head. Part of me is slightly disappointed in some of the story decisions. Still, I thought the movie was very well done.<br/><br/>The ironic part is that people are going to hate this movie for the exact opposite reason as the Force Awakens. The Force Awakens was like a chocolate cake. It was super delicious but somewhat simplistic. This movie is deeper and the flavor is going to drive some people away. The Last Jedi could be called the new Empire. This is not because it follows the same story beats as Empire but it is Empire in the sense that it leaves the audience unsure of how to respond. Like I said, I liked it. I need to watch it again a few more times. While it did not follow the epic I wrote in my head or the old EU, I do not think it's trash. I am not sure if this is simply a good Star Wars movie or if it is something truly special. As far as criticisms go, I think the movie has some pacing issues and not all the dialogue works. Not a negative but some of the character decisions might make fans uncomfortable. The plus is that this movie is something new and it has breathtaking visuals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Somehow, they managed to exceed my expectations. This movie is horrible. I honestly can't think of a single good thing about it other than that the music (almost all of which is from earlier Star Wars films) and that it isn't a remake of The Empire Strikers Back. Besides that, there's almost nothing good about it. The pacing is terrible, and it jumps between scenes with completely different emotional tones and, despite being the longest running Star Wars movie ever, speeds through practically every scene. Extremely important story moments are covered in only a few minutes, while unimportant scenes seem to stretch on as long as possible. Most people I talked to had little idea what the plot even was, aside from the information provided by The Force Awakens. The plot makes no sense either, and would be avoided if the characters weren't complete idiots who make mind-numbly stupid decisions, such as hiring shady criminals in a dark alley to help them, or wanting to escape on ships that they know don't have weapons. There's also no explanation as to the current political situation, and it's unclear what's even happening in the Galaxy at large. It's not even clear who's funding the inexplicably recreated Empire, and it's not even clear if the New Republic still exists. Worst of all, everything was reset and everything that ever happened in the original movies means absolutely nothing now. Every victory every won by the Rebellion, every superweapon destroyed, every system liberated - are all meaningless. Han Solo returned to being a smuggler and divorced Leia and was murdered by his son in the most obvious trap imaginable, Luke Skywalker became a failure and ran away to pout on a deserted island and also ultimately died, and the New Republic the rebels fought and died to create was destroyed by in five minutes of screen time by a new Empire which is inexplicably strong enough to build a planet-sized superweapon which is now left to be opposed by a new Rebellion which itself will ultimately be destroyed when they inevitably make another trilogy. The writing is insulting. There's one scene where Leia is sucked into the vacuum of space and somehow survives floating through it for several minutes and pulls herself with the Force to her ship. The dialogue is filled with "jokes" which are always as out-of-place as possible. For example, there's one scene where the entire Resistance is evacuating where Leia says to C-3PO to "wipe that nervous look off your face", or something to that effect. Rey is still a flawless Mary Sue who, according to Yoda's force ghost, already knows everything contained in the entirety of Jedi scripture, while Luke Skywalker's character was completely ruined, and he went from leading the Rebellion to victory against the Empire and being set to recreate the Jedi Order to a failure who attempted murdering one of his students and burning down the original Jedi Temple. Yoda's ghost later shows up to burn down the temple for him through the Force, which begs the question of why force ghosts have never interacted with the physical world in such a way before, and so why Yoda doesn't just go kill Snoke himself, who wouldn't be able to fight back as Yoda is already a force ghost. Also, while Yoda is destroying the original Jedi scripture by doing this, he mocks it and says that Rey already knows everything contained in them, as noted above. The cinematography and directing are also terrible. Even though the sets and environments are beautiful, the camera seems to have no idea what it's supposed to be doing. It will randomly cut away from the characters for two seconds to the top of a mountain or something else nearby and cut immediately back to them as if nothing happened, and other times will cut between different characters, forward in time, or even to dreams or hallucinations without giving any indication that it switched to something else. The film also seems to have an obsession with randomly making things slow motion and silent during action scenes, which feels out of place in a Star Wars movie, extremely overused given its inclusion in seemingly every action scene, and also takes you out of a scene that would otherwise be engaging. Thank you for reading my review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Did someone forget to do their writing homework and have to do it on the bus before they got to school?  The writing is awful.  No backstory on Snoke?  Luke dies because he tried too hard doing a hologram projection?  It's not that I don't like it because it's a departure from Star Wars of the pat.  I don't like it because it has no depth and it sucks.  If I wanted another fun senseless movie I'll go see an Avengers movie.  It's what they do.  Star Wars is the complete package, or rather was.  Think Jar Jar Binks was bad?  Well his movie currently rates higher than Last Jedi.  Thanks Disney.  Suck it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I was lead to believe that this was supposed to be dark, serious, emotional; yet it turned out to be half sci-fi half comedy. (SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>- Luke's character is completely wasted, there was so much potential for him to have a grand entrance, change the lore, further the plot, and have a meaningful conclusion. Yet they chose to make his opening scene start out with comedy, and kill him of exhaustion, or whatever..?<br/><br/>- Leia officially has developed her force powers to the point where she can sustain herself in the cold void of space, and force pull herself through that space like superman. Vader could not live without his mask, despite being one of the most powerful force users ever, even after being turned into more machine than man. - Rey still does not get any official jedi training other than audio lessons about the force and the hypocrisy of the Jedi, yet takes out multiple praetorian guards at the same time, and lifts thousands of pounds of rocks. Luke could not lift the X-Wing after training with Yoda, who has been teaching Jedi for centuries. So, Mary Sue much?<br/><br/>- WAAAAAAYYYY too much comedy in this movie. It's not that the comedy wasn't funny, it's that it felt like almost every other scene of this film was a comedy bit. The opening dialogue of the film is comedic. Also, Yoda is comic relief. Sigh.<br/><br/>-  The film is very inconsequential as a whole. It doesn't really world build much at all or further the general story, other than the rebellion being in the same boat it's almost always been in, which is losing some and winning some. It does not expand upon the lore very much, other than the new abilities like force skype, and force astral projection(which apparently kills you, no matter how powerful of a force user you are). - Characters Finn, Poe, and Rose did not actually progress anywhere. Finn and Rose's sole purpose was to be filler in this film, then fight phasma, and kiss (come on?! seriously with the cliche?!). Poe is there to be annoyed with the stand in for Leia, a good pilot to win against any odds, and say, "we're the spark that will light the fire to the rebellion" in a cool way to play on the audiences emotions and provide exposition as to the point of the film.<br/><br/>- Speaking on that ^.. What is the point of this film? Is it so that we can watch a 2 1/2 hour lock in between the rebels and the first order? Could you really not come up with a better story than that? Like idk, using the last of the fuel reserves to land on a planet(take us to another world with interesting dynamics perhaps?), defend the fortifications long enough to refuel the ship so that you can light speed through the ships (which was cool by the way, thank you) whilst being in an interesting place other than a cruiser? - ^ That's just the rebellion side of the story too. The mysticism side of the story, or the lore of the jedi, sith, and the force went pretty much nowhere. We found out that Luke knows of the Jedi's failures and hypocrisy, that Snoke is still just a random villain with no other motive than to simply kill the rebels, Rey is incredibly powerful with almost no effort. Again, could we not have used Luke's masterful force potential for something more cool? - The film mainly doesn't set well with me because I was led to believe that this was going to be a seriously dark toned story, (the trailers, the red and white drab colors on the marketing, "it's time for the jedi to end", the dark, menacing music and tone of the trailers) and then we got a film that dumps on the lore, spits on Luke, is stationary throughout half the runtime, drags on, uses every opportunity to get a laugh(Thanks Disney), and disrespects all of the fans who expected the star wars movie that you lead them to believe was to be. It doesn't matter to me if every fan theory was wrong, it doesn't matter if i didnt get what *I* wanted, what I do care about is you giving me what you lead me this film was going to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Only good part of this movie was the Kylo Ren - Ray story line. The Luke Skywalker storyline was the worst part. He should have gone down in the flesh fighting the bad guys using crazy force powers. Instead he was a coward, I think he died of a heart attack. The Rebel - First Order combat was also pretty bad. A third grader must have thought it up. There is no gravity in space, you don't have to fly over the dreadnought to drop bombs on it. The subsequent ship chase made no sense. The First Oder could have easily destroyed the Rebel ship with tie fighters or having other ships light speed in front it. The space combat aspect of this movie was garbage. The movie is very sexist, all the male characters were either stupid, cowardly, or evil. The humor was hit or miss, sometimes good sometimes misplaced. Disney will make tons of money on this movie but the franchise is in trouble.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Please do not go the cinema. I watched the originals on repeat some days when I was a little kid. To me, this new Star Wars was a rap*e of the spirit of the films. I have never been so angry during a film, or walking out afterwards. Star Wars was not just a movie, it was a sub-psychological spiritual doctrine for the western countries, it was beautiful, inspiring, romantic and wonderful. Don't let this molestation enter your memory of it. There are about 15 moments you will literally wonder if they were trying to destroy the franchise for good.. and you thought Jar-jar was bad!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7876476"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br/><br/><br/>O novo episódio de "Guerra nas Estrelas'' joga com a expectativa criada de que seria um remake d'O Império contra-ataca, de modo similar que ''O Despertar da Força'' emula ''Uma Nova Esperança''. As situações estão todas lá, construídas perfeitamente para que os mesmos jargões sejam usados de forma segura e nostálgica. No entanto, os temas subjacentes sofrem mudanças importantes, e a solução do conflito tende sempre à surpresa.<br/><br/>E são todas ótimas surpresas, que revigoram a mitologia da saga ao mesmo tempo que permitem a expansão de seu universo. Os avisos de Luke para Rey, ''Isso não vai se passar do modo que você imagina'' e ''O que você acha que eu faria, pegaria uma espada laser e sairia pela galáxia para dizimar a Primeira Ordem?'', são emblemas que permitem ao roteirista Rian C. Johnson navegar por mares conhecidos através de correntes pouco aproveitadas.<br/><br/>Assim com em "O Império contra-ataca", dois arcos principais se desenvolvem simultaneamente até que confluem no terceiro ato. No primeiro deles, espera-se uma reedição do treinamento em Dagobah. Rey é enviada pela Resistência e apresenta a Luke as credenciais de ter sido recomendada por Leia.<br/><br/>Assim como Yoda, Luke se mostra relutante em relação a nova discípula, mas por motivos bem diferentes. O mestre sabe que o conflito entre os jedi e os sith cega para uma harmonia maior, que, ao ser ignorada, reproduz o embate em escala ampliada. Desse modo, sua decisão é se isolar na ilha mais sagrada da Ordem até encontrar a paz necessária para que possa morrer, levando consigo todo o legado do qual se tornaria o último representante. Skywalker concede três lições a Rey, buscando fazer com que a moça compreenda a necessidade do fim dos Jedi. Por trás de todos os vínculos se esconde esse poder, essa força, que também está presente em todos os seres. Luke demonstra a vaidade que está por trás da crença de que a ''luz se extinguiria sem os Jedi''.<br/><br/>Não que o nosso heroi se livre da tentação do apego à realidade em que cresceu. Ele hesita quando se trata de destruir a árvore sagrada da Ordem, que marca seu centro cósmico e esconde seus textos originais. Luke não sabe se a hora realmente chegou. Sua indecisão é rompida pela presença mágica de Yoda, que coloca fim à materialidade da história Jedi e dá uma lição no antigo discípulo: não há nada nos livros destruídos que Rey já não soubesse, e não cabe a esse ou aquele mestre estabelecer a hora do término do conflito entre luz e sombras. O que cabe ao mestre é transmitir o que aprendeu, incluindo o poder que se esconde por trás de seus fracassos.<br/><br/>Rey, por sua vez, continua em sua jornada marcada pela carência de raízes. Ela projeta a figura paterna em Skywalker, do mesmo modo que projetara em Han Solo. Sua ânsia pelo fim da rejeição a leva diretamente para o confronto contra o lado obscuro, e ela vê seus múltiplos e aparentemente infindáveis reflexos, que representam camadas de seu ser, em uma sucessão desesperadora que, quando enfrentada, a conduz mais uma vez a si mesma e à sua própria solidão. Essa solidão, por sua vez, a abre para a influência de Ben Solo.<br/><br/>O líder dos cavaleiros de Ren também enfrenta o mesmo tema da libertação de qualquer dualidade, que nele toma a forma de ruptura com o passado. O novo deve suplantar o contexto e as estruturas já estabelecidas. Luz, sombras, Jedi, Sith, pais, mestres, rebeldes, Império pertenceriam ao passado da saga. O futuro está em seu vínculo com Rey, cuja carência pretende suprir ao revelar à menina aquilo que ela já desconfiava: ela não é ''ninguém'', não pertence a nenhuma linhagem nobre que lhe dê direito de tomar parte significativa na história dos Skywalker. Seu papel seria dependente de sua relação com o filho de Han e Leia.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Researching some of the aspects behind the scenes are beginning to make more sense. The Good<br/>A handful of shots are incredible and iconic in their look.<br/>The Rey and Kylo dynamic becomes intimately stronger.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/>Charaters and characterization are completely disregarded.<br/>Lackluster anticlimactic ending.<br/>The entire film is inconsequential, ultimately serving little purpose in the overarching story. (Mind you thats with the death of 5+ substantial characters.)<br/>Messy writing with plot holes throughout. Beyond those bullet points I can say this is a very mixed movie that “is not going to go the way you think” but let us examine why that is. Currently the climate towards any SW fan saying they didn’t love this movie seems to be that expectations are unattainably high, or that the film didn’t unfold the way you would have preferred and similar. Personally I find that largely inaccurate, my dislike of this film has nothing to do with the movie not being what I wanted it to be though the film seems to be disappointing to many.  Rain Johnson takes existing character development and essentially throws it out and in many cases leaving confused characterizations to remain. Many characters feel more like a Spaceballs counterpart than anything. Humor is at a Prequel level of childish and forced. Dialogue is mostly poor sans a few good moments and the flow of the movie is all over the place. I like practically everybody didn’t like the Casino scene whatsoever and could have done without Finn, Rose and DJ even being in this movie. Luke is inconsistent and changes his demeanor abruptly but ultimately Luke serves no purpose in this film other than stalling Kylo. Really this film is largely a waste of time, I’ve seen it twice and returned tickets to see it any further, it just doesn’t give you any real substance other than the Kylo Rey dynamic. Rain Johnson wanted to make a Space Samurai movie and that he has done in style. Reports are than Johnson wouldn’t agree to do this film unless he could throw out Lawrence Kasdans draft and do his own thing. This was a major mistake on Lucasfilms part. The original trilogy worked so well with 3 directors because the story was all coming from the same source, same with Harry Potter, and ALL other movie franchises. This movie is ultimately a misstep that I have no doubt will become a financial and receptive disaster. Rian Johnson your overly cockiness and ego got the best of you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It delivers fantastic performances, writing, cinematography, action, special effects, music, worlds, emotional moments and beyond that; something truly special. The acting in this movie is simply amazing. Everyone does a great job but some of the standouts for me were Rey, Kylo Ren, Luke, and Snoke. They arguably have some of the most integral scenes in the movie and flawlessly deliver believable and emotionally driven performances. The writing is also great; with more twists and turns then any Star Wars movie before. It will keep you guessing the entire movie, and continue to prove you wrong time and time again. The cinematography is very beautiful and unique to The Last Jedi as Rian Johnson's long time cinematographer Steve Yedlin worked on this movie. He framed certain shots in a way no Star Wars movie has ever done before, which is great as it gives this movie a really different feel. The action sequences are fantastic. The lightsaber choreography specifically blew me away as to how amazingly executed it was in this movie. The special effects are also top notch. Snoke specifically looks much better than he did in The Force Awakens. His appearance is a lot more life like and believable. There are not as many new musical themes in this movie as The Force Awakens, though the music is still memorable and balanced very well throughout the movie. I really liked the new locations in this movie. Of course it spends more time on Ahch-To, which is always a beautiful sight to see. Canto Bight is a gorgeous looking town with lots of light effects and things going on. And Crait looks gorgeous with the salt flats and bursting red colours. The movie is also filled with some really great emotional moments. I want to highlight on Leia specifically, as there are certain moments in this movie that pay tribute to her last appearance in the saga perfectly. All of what I have mentioned is great, but this movie does something else entirely that makes it so special. The movie has an underlying message/meaning, that separates it from the rest of the saga. I do not want to give away too much without spoiling it, but The Last Jedi makes you rethink about its heroes, and what it means to be a hero. The movie is not without its flaws, however certain people will be bothered by more things than others. Some of the humour in the beginning of the movie did not work for me, and some of the supporting characters could have had better conclusions. But the things it does not do well, are far out shined by the things it does tremendously well. I can see why this movie is getting a mixed reception, as it takes a lot of risks that some may not agree with. However for me, I think the risks it takes are incredibly powerful and payoff in the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Women are now dying in bombers, fighters and big battleships, also all generals are women as well. Really Disney, how can you be so obvious?<br/>Fighting is boring and it seems all the "jedi" have forgotten how to fight with a light saber.<br/>"Bad guys" are just a bunch of arrogant, naive and angry little kids who are angry a lot and love power.

A lot of tropes from the previous films were led up to the edge and just pushed off.<br/><br/>Really enjoyed the more expansive view of what the force is and how the Jedi fit in with it. I read a lot of bile in these reviews, and passionate fans have every right to spout off.  But there was no outrage in this movie for me. I’d frame more than a few scenes differently, but I like where Mr. Johnson took this.

The action was good, the creativity was good, the cinematography was good. It also answered most of the question in "The Force Awaken" and opened a lot more, Some people will be satisfied but some won't.

There is a padded out middle with a needless side plot that contributes nothing to the story. It gives more time to throw away characters, but still leaves them as throw away characters by it's resolution. They also include an odd technological plot point that feels more like Star Trek than Star Wars. There are so many holes in the story left by The Force Awakens, but The Last Jedi uses it's long run time to create it's own new holes instead of filling the old ones. You can totally tell which scenes were added for those re-shoots that delayed the movie from May to December and they were completely unnecessary. I think TFA is actually better overall because while TFA replaced story with action, TLJ replaces story with just... well nothing much really. Filler. The jokes are mostly bad but they don't distract too much from what's going on. People will defend this movie by calling criticisms nitpicking but I really don't think they are. The plot holes are huge and obvious. You don't need to nitpick them, you can't miss them.<br/>Having different writers and directors for the 3 movies is giving them a total lack of consistency in vision for the story.<br/>Overall this trilogy feels like a cash in to sell books and eventually create a huge new extended universe just like the old cannon had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Me giving a 1/10 for a Star Wars movie, a franchise that helped raise me, a franchise that I could basically forgive anything, and give my money to, how can a company be so disconnected from it's core base, and ruin the franchise. It would seem like it would be an impossible task, as so many people in the past has managed to create great content for the Universe, whether it be fan made movies, or video games. I'm just dumbstruck, the people who enjoy this movie must be bereft their common sense and somehow be on drugs to enjoy it.<br/><br/>George Lucas created star wars for 12 year olds, disney created star wars for social justice warriors and stoned hippies. Star Wars was a subject without political agendas, it was something anyone, anywhere no matter what your religion, your political standpoint, your race or your birthplace. Everyone could connect to star wars, and there was a unity, a bond between all humans in that.<br/><br/>This, this is not that! This breaks that bond! This makes it us vs you! Those of us with common sense who can see the **** we're being served, and  those of you who think what you're being served is sweet chocolate.<br/><br/>Star Wars is dead, long ling the evil coorporation empire disney, who ruined a strong and bonding bond for all mankind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Oh how wrong I was.<br/><br/>The main conceit of the thing is that the Empire can't track ships in Hyperspace until now so the Resistance can't just flee the bad guys' fleet and the whole plot revolves around how the Rebels are gonna escape that fleet bearing down on them (also, why couldn't the bad guys call in another fleet to head off the rebels? Do they only have 6 ships? Or couldn't a couple of those have made a quick Hyperspace U-turn to get ahead? No, I guess it makes more sense to just have them follow afterward forever). Um, except that if one watches, the original Star Wars movie, Vader very clearly tracked the Millennium Falcon through Hyperspace to the Rebel base...<br/><br/>Secondly, Rey and Kylo can see each other across space through the Force? F*** you, Rian Johnson.<br/><br/>Oh, and Luke can astral-project himself (with a spiffy new haircut, a change of clothes, and Han's dice) across the galaxy and engage in lightsaber combat (with the wrong color lightsaber, I might add). Again, f*** you Rian Johnson.<br/><br/>The entire casino planet just aggravated me. Why are 95% of the characters human and wearing Earth suits? Are they in Monaco or a galaxy far, far away? And why are all the games exactly the same as what I might find at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas? (Because these filmmakers are the laziest group of hacks ever given the reins of a multimillion dollar franchise, that's why.) When you're making a 2.5 hour movie, maybe cut a subplot that accomplishes nothing and turns out to be incredibly annoying. Just an idea.<br/><br/>"The Resistance needs you because Kylo Ren has grown too powerful in the Force and the First Order cannot be defeated." I'm pretty sure Daisy Ridley said that exact line 3 times to Luke. Remember what I said about lazy hacks?<br/><br/>The sequence on Snoke's command ship where he tries to turn Daisy to the dark side was almost word for word the same sequence from Return of the Jedi when Sidious attempted to lure Luke to his team. It's great in Return of the Jedi (probably my favorite sequence of the entire 6-film Star Wars universe), but when you simply rehash it with different characters, shockingly it loses all effect.<br/><br/>I am so tired of Rey. She has no character arc. She is poorly written and acted. She simply gets swept along with events and doesn't really have anything in the way of motivation. All of the new characters lack any originality or life that would interest me in their journeys. Finn is so "gee whiz, wow" as to be annoying. Poe had the most interesting arc here, going from being the a-hole who got a whole squadron killed to sort of seeing how to actually be a hero, but every one of his scenes with BB-8 still annoys me and since every decision he makes in the film is wrong I can't really find myself cheering for him.<br/><br/>Why did the black ball droid who figured out it was BB-8 under the inverted garbage can let the stupid little droid go when all his co-conspirators were captured? Is it because he needed to be free for his deus ex machina appearance in the scout walker to save the day? Oh, I see, it's once again because these are lazy **** filmmakers. Gotcha.<br/><br/>The porgs annoyed me. Does this universe need more cute characters to do something stupid n the corner of the screen? And the fact that they, the "racehorses," and the crystal foxes seemed to be sentient enough to have emotions of fear, empathy, and surprise was just stupid. If you want to have a semi-sentient animal that's fine, but three separate such species on three separate worlds? Give me a break.<br/><br/>The special effects were even bad! There was a scene with Luke and Rey standing on the cliff face (her first lesson, I believe) where the cliff is so clearly a green screen it is laughable.<br/><br/>And that brings me to Luke. If you've seen the original Star Wars trilogy, the core of Return of the Jedi is Luke's refusal to kill Vader because he alone understands that no one is beyond redemption. In the face of his own death he stands up to the most powerful men in the galaxy to bring his father back from the dark side. Mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagreed with every decision Rian Johnson made with regard to Luke and I fully see why. Like Jar Jar Abrams, Johnson does not understand who Luke Skywalker is. His first instinct would not be to murder his apprentice when he sees darkness in him; it would be to do everything in his power to bring him back from that darkness. This isn't even a father he never knew. This is the son of his best friend in the universe and his sister. There is no way he thinks to kill that boy; he would die before that.<br/><br/>It's unbelievable just how inept Episodes VII and VIII have been. I'm honestly not sure I'll bother seeing IX theatrically at this point because the truth is I simply don't care what happens going forward in this Disney fan fiction garbage universe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Nothing bad happens to Rey. She always overpowers or bests Kylo. There's really no danger. I'm not that excited for the finale. I will say that the space battles were awesome, and the filming style was absolutely spot-on. Poe Dameron is made to look like an idiot in this one (over time), and literally .... there are no white male leaders in this rebellion. I think they just vanished! No, but it was painfully obvious -- especially when almost all the First Order's leaders were evil white males. Luke is in this one a lot more than I thought, but his appearance wasn't completely satisfying either. Rian takes a bold step in this one with Luke's now infamous line, "It's time for the Jedi to end." This movie continues with that thought, so it's very contrary to the ending of The Last Jedi (unless you interpret that the Jedi aren't needed since the Sith were destroyed). What Disney fails to realize is that we want MORE LIGHTSABERS. It seems that in stepping away from the Prequels Disney has gone too far in the opposite direction. In this movie, the Resistance is made to look very small and weak. I honestly don't even know how Disney will set up the 3rd movie. There are good things about this movie, but they mostly revolve around the technical side of it. If you at least see it with an open mind you might not be completely disappointed. This movie also contradicts itself! You'll see near the end. Luke's line may not be true after all!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The only bright spots of the film were the acting on the part of Daisy Ridley and Mark Hammill. Everyone else was pretty awful. Overused clichés again, out of place dialogue, and lack of appreciation for the Star Wars universe. Its like they tried to make this a marvel movie. They didn't stay true to what the force means and is in the star wars universe. And they decided to throw the plot into total chaos for the last film. Its hard to give thorough criticisms of this film without spoilers, but the biggest problems were in the writing and the plot. It was not well done at all. I thought the prequel movies were well written but suffered from bad acting, effects, and setting art. This film cant even hang its hat on being well written. Most disappointing movie I've seen in recent memory. I would tell you don't go see it but I know you will because its star wars. Just don't go in with high expectations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
