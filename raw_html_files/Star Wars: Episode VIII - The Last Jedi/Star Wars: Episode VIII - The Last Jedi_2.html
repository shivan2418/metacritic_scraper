                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_9478928"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This movie was awful but not for the general reasons involving wokeness and current year patriarchy bashing nonsense. This movie was bad because of the leadership both in the production and in the characters in the movie. Everyone involved in the writing process is out shopping. it is painfully obvious nobody in this generation was involved in any actual real world military. If we reduce the space opera to a World War Two Admiralty scenario, we can use the following parallel: Imagine you are a Navy Admiral in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack. In stead of regrouping and reforming for a plan, you gather all the allied forces and retreat. Your Wing Commander wants to make a retaliatory strike, but instead of sending the proper tools for the job, you send the wrong aircraft and smaller boats and sacrifice all of them. You have a plan but you never inform your upper echelon and higher command structure. You continue to deuce out. You just run. Japan’s fleet is chasing after you and the remainder of you forces. Japan’s fleet is picking off your ships one at a time. Your Wing commander on the largest carrier comes to you and states he and the Air Wing can hold off and even destroy Japan’s ships with high altitude low risk bombing runs. If they cannot do this, they could at least kamikaze themselves and buy some time or at least cripple the enemy. YOU as the Admiral say “nah”. No explanation of why, because there could be spies around. YOU as the Admiral ignore the situation and just want everyone to stand in awe of your military tactical prowess by NOT telling your upper echelon and ENTIRE LEADERSHIP the plan and course of retaliation other than to high tail it to Sacramento or San Francisco. YOU as the Admiral share another plan to just stay the course and basically escort Japan’s fleet to mainland United States. You as the Admiral do absolutely nothing and take offense when someone takes initiative. You, as the Admiral, have your Fleet Wing Commander charged with mutiny when he decides to do his duty and his job by fighting the enemy.  You do not fight, you do not attack, you do not bargain or surrender, you just stay the course. Then, 3 miles off the coast of California, you alone jump in a submarine and torpedo the enemy vessel. The attack was successful and the dreadnought was crippled, but now the enemy fleet is close enough to land. Japan makes a beachhead and commit to an invasion of California. Now the fleet is without leadership and the war was pulled to mainland US. Good job. You could have done this the whole time, or even remote controlled it into a guided weapon while both fleets were still in Southeast Asia or at the very least, torpedoed the ever loving crap out of the pursuing ships. Instead your incompetence and poor leadership led Japan to invade San Diego and take Temecula and Escondido. The remnants of the American fleet continue to retreat along with the rest of American forces back to the Rocky Mountains waiting for reinforcements from Kansas and Oklahoma. You have lost the war. Half of this movie has a side story where a whinny PFC begs General Patton to lead and then returns alone to Mary Sue leadership of the American Fleet. Two other equally whinny but hubris filled sailors attempt to find General MacArthur but their attempt fails too. Instead they found Bing Crosby and they return empty handed. Nothing they did had any impact on the outcome of the war. They wasted time and resources and everyone’s patience. The movie ends with reinforcements graduating boot camp as a Three Star General. This movie sucks. There was no point to any of this lazy writing and it is indicative of a generation and culture who has seen war on TV but never been to a war or had the threat of war in their neighborhood. Thank you for ruining Star Wars, Pumpkin-head and Hubris Medusa.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I am a star wars fan, and I will never watch this movie again, ever.  Yes it's that bad.  Main plot point is that a large first order ship can't catch up to a large resistance ship that is right in front of them.... WOW.  Apparently none of the first order weapons or star fighters work after an initial clash with the resistance... WOW. And yes, this goes on for the most of the entire movie.  Now let's move on to the character assassination that happened during this WOKE! star wars attempt at a movie.  The main narrative for character assassination when it comes to this WOKE! fest is that MEN are completely incompetent.  First up, Luke Skywalker is a putz.  I'm sorry if you thought he was some strong, accomplished, battle tested leader.  NOPE, he's just a hermit living alone, feeling sorry for himself.  The film blames his absence for the first order even existing.<br/><br/>Anyone remember Dameron Poe from the force awakens?  Military trained, Ace Pilot, Spy that understands the cost of fighting a monolithic oppressive force...  NOPE, in this movie he is a toddler that apparently doesn't understand ANYTHING that they have been doing or fighting for.  This stupefied version of his character is written so that Leia and Holdo can hold the toddlers hand and tell him to calm down and let the women handle the situation.  Mostly because they have written him to rage and fly off the handle at every opportunity in the movie and he does.  Because Men are beasts who cannot control themselves... obviously.<br/><br/>What about Finn from the Force awakens?  How about we throw him into a completely unnecessary situation (entire casino plot) and forced attraction with yet another new female character that has zero appeal or chemistry with him on screen?  Gotta hit that diversity quota I guess... I'm sure the actress that plays Rose is a great person, but the character itself serves absolutely no purpose in the film.  The entire Casino subplot was a left political bent fantasy of the writers/producers and completely 100% cringe worthy.<br/><br/>I can go on but really, it was **** movie, with forced far left activism destroying any sense of actual entertainment value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Action scenes are unbelievably bad and nonsensical (look for characters throwing away their weapons). The whole clown fiesta is topped off by more plot holes than I have ever seen in a movie before. This is without a doubt the worst SW movie ever made, and if the world was a fair place, Rian Johnson would never be hired to direct another movie ever again.

The plot was bad. I mean epic level bad. It included but limited to waste of life and resources on a pointless attack, A disregard for general intelligence in not sharing tactics and strategy with the senior leadership of the rebels leading to one cluster mess after another. They completely dismissed the original characters or made them all quick cut out throwaways why even bring them back. Luke Skywalker deserved a better fate, Han Solo Deserved a better fate. Hope they got a good payday from Disney to waste there times in those films. It does little to capture the fun and adventure as the first 3 movies and any fan of these movies would have to agree that hanging out with Jar Jar Binks for hours on end would be preferable than watching this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

With so many great Star Wars authors, flatly ignored by Disney, and with so much money, how can you end-up with such a bad story.  Utterly ignoring even The Force Awakens (first of this trilogy) is mind-blogging, as it shows that the team and Disney did not even have a story planned to start with.  I will not detail all the bad points that numerous reviewers on Youtube properly explained.  This movie must not be considered canon in the Star Wars universe/lore. -- It is the opposite of a "must see". I watch such corny movies with a child's heart, so it is very hard to make me give a negative review!  I write this months later, with nearly a year to think about it (read: not just a reaction).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

My friends were divided between "it's OK" and "it's the worst Star Wars movie ever," but I thought that meant it would be a thoughtful and engaging film given the praise critics heaped upon it. I should have realized nobody said it was a great movie, but I found it the most disappointing film I watched. First of all, the pacing was off and the movie jumps from scene to scene without a realistic time flow. Due to reasons other viewers mentioned, I found it hard to suspend my disbelief despite not exactly having high standards in that department. The acting from the villains was over-the-top and the protagonists' acting was melodramatic-maybe OK if this were a romance movie, but it isn't. Both the protagonists and antagonists acted in a manner that broke verisimilitude and rationality.<br/>I guess it was pretty to look at though, like a Transformers movie. To conclude, this movie failed to make me excited about the sequel or any Star Wars media made under Disney. As critics seem to have a very different definition of a good movie compared to mine, I will not be watching Episode 9 unless the audience reviews are overwhelmingly positive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But I didn't. While it has its moments, it's far from the quality film we deserve. I have always maintained that I love all Star Wars movies equally and think they all deserve a place in the series. I love the original trilogy, I love the prequels, and I even really loved The Force Awakens. Which is why this movie was such a disappointment. This movie doesn't "feel" like Star Wars. Rogue One didn't really "feel" like Star Wars either, but in a different way. Rogue One was different, but still good. The Last Jedi feels like a high-quality Star Wars fan fiction that the interns drafted up while all the talented Star Wars writers were out to lunch. From the very outset, we're given an opener with tons of cheese that I guess was supposed to make the kids laugh because Disney mandated it. And the entire film is full of forced one-liners and humor that falls flat. Then there's Kathleen Kennedy's lovely forced diversity. Every character in the Resistance is either a woman, a racial minority, or often both. Laura Dern plays an unlikable moron with purple hair and Rose Tico is completely unnecessary to the film. One of the characters even has an annoying speech impediment. Nobody cares about this kind of stuff in movies, and it's especially annoying considering it came at the cost of quality. Speaking of which, this movie is all over the place. There are a handful of good scenes and not much else.  I forgave Rey's effortless use of the Force in Episode VII because it had just awakened in her and was so powerful, even Snoke felt it. But Rey doesn't even have much of a personality in TLJ and overcomes every dumb obstacle with minimal effort. Speaking of Snoke, he's not a mysterious dark presence anymore, he's a wrinkled old man in a hideous bathrobe who dies like a b**** and we don't learn anything meaningful about him before he does. The entire casino planet part was entirely unnecessary and reeks of the writers desperately wanting to have another eye-popping cantina scene like the last movie. Rose whines to Finn about child slavery so they save a bunch of animals and then leave the kids behind to stay as slaves for some reason. Captain Phasma reveals she's not dead and approximately 3 minutes later, she's effortlessly cut down by Finn the janitor in hand-to-hand combat. Chewie is just kind of there the whole movie and never does anything. Luke is all sad because he failed as a Jedi and acts like a whiny jerk for most of the movie instead of the powerful Jedi he supposedly is. There's an absolutely horrendous scene where Leia gets sucked into space and magically flies back into the ship with the Force with absolutely no explanation as to how or why. You might as well have just shown her in space then blacked out the screen with the words "plot device" on it, then cut to Leia safe inside the ship because it would have had the exact same effect on me. Then at the end, there's a generic recreation of the Battle of Hoth that I couldn't be bothered to care about. Also, for the entirety of the film, Kylo Ren is still an edgy, angry crybaby. Every line of dialogue in this film feels like it was written by freshman drama students and character development is completely nonexistent aside from Luke's change of heart and admittedly cool showdown with Kylo Ren, which aside from the throne room fight was the only part of this movie I actually enjoyed. The Last Jedi is an absolute mess and it certainly isn't a Star Wars movie, whatever it may be. I'm not blinded by nostalgia, I liked The Force Awakens. But this movie dashes any interest or development episode VII created for the Star Wars saga. I honestly have no interest in seeing where the story goes from here because the journey up to this point was so absurd and poorly executed. I'd honestly be satisfied if JJ Abrams revealed in Episode IX that everything that happened in TLJ was just Rey's fever dream or something and then pick up from where TFA left off and not totally suck this time. I'm not in the category of people who think this movie is the worst film ever made and it wasn't quite as bad as I assumed it would be. But I felt lukewarm about it as I watched it and the more I marinate over it, the less appealing it becomes. I had the same experience with The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. And that's what this film is isn't it? It's the Crystal Skull of Star Wars. Let's forget it ever happened and never speak of it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

While I was looking through the reviews I saw a post that said: "Once again, Star Wars: The Last Jedi manages to bring back everything that made the other movies good"... or something like that, but I'm going to focus on the 'manages to bring back', cause, it does bring back stuff from the other movies, but that's the problem, it's unoriginal and it's just another cheap ploy by Disney to make money. Understand that I am a fan of Star Wars, just not a fan of the way Disney is now conducting themselves when they create these movies.

Story is very boring, confusing and hard to understand.<br/><br/>Directing - F.<br/>Felt like the movie was directed by a 10 year old kid who has ADD.<br/><br/>Acting - C.<br/>Some characters are new and don't do anything and/or what is there purpose. Acting is nothing good - nothing bad just average.<br/><br/>Editing - F.<br/>The movie should have ended at least 15-20 minutes earlier if not more. The pace of this movie is terrible.<br/><br/>Musical Score - B.<br/>Keeps with the tradition of previous Star Wars films.<br/><br/>Special Effects - A.<br/>Great blend of CGI with practical effects.  Some of the best in a movie. Along with costume design and make-up.<br/><br/>Cinematography/Production Design - A.<br/>Well done. Looks clean and a well made film.<br/><br/>Overall Score - 4.3/10<br/>Too bad the production, Special Effects, Musical Score, Costume Design and Make-up are not the heart and soul of a movie. In those categories; some of the best ever for a movie. However, it lacks a comprehensive and organize story, new characters one may not care about; along with no character development, poor directing and bad editing; that in the end makes this the worst Star Wars film to date.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Every one involved in that movie except Mark Hamill should be ashamed of themselves, they literally are ruining the fabrics of society with their absurd sjw pushed agenda.<br/><br/>It's as if they are seeking to have humans hate each other and put them in a state of civil animosity. This movie is pure garbage that destroy and humiliates beloved/established characters by replacing them with unlikable characters that have no story to back anything in what they can acheive.<br/><br/>Kathleen Kennedy is the worst of the worst and she placed the worst trolls of all time to direct this movie by obviously spitting on George Lucas hard work.<br/><br/>This is outrageous.

The first 1  1/2 hours felt like they tried to fit 2 Hours of Spaceballs into the movie: to many jokes, to many stupid punch lines. Anoying<br/>2.	Score: uh was that bad.<br/>3.	Story: where to begin?<br/>a.	That stupid and useless sideplot destroyed the only decent Character (Finn) for TFA<br/>b.	Leia flying in Space without a Spacesuit, what dit the secreenwriter smoke? She should have died. Making force users able to live and move in Space is a stupid idea!<br/>c.	Hyperspacing into Ships: cool effect, but why did the Rebellion didn't do that with the Death Stars? Droid controlled Frigate hyperspacing into Death Star(s) and not one Rebel life is endangered. Deus ex machina Screenwriting? Alway a bat thing<br/>d.	Luke Skywalker giving up his complete ideology and leaving the galaxy high and dry? Who wrote that crap?<br/>e.	Why does the Resistance exist in the first place? Why weren't all oft hem part oft he new Republic (which actually existed) ... okay, that is mainly a dumb thing of TFA, but it contuinued to this movie<br/>f.	Slow speed chase: why didn't the Empir... ah ... New Order just call for more ships to cut into the Resistances way? Or just jumped in front oft them? Instead they chased them for weeks (remember: Finn and Rose went t that lenghty, useless sidequest)<br/>4.	Characters<br/>a.	Kylo Ren: still as intimidating as Lord Dark Helmet. And, by the way: Ben ist he Name oft he son of Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker, the Kinds of Han and Leia are Jacen, Jaina and Anakin!<br/>b.	General Hux: still a bad Josef G�bbels Joke<br/>c.	Chewbacca: he should have eaten all of those anoyying furballs ... what purpose did they have in that movie (except for merchandise)<br/>d.	Balldroid: still a stupid and anoyying idea ... by the way: why does it have a coinslot and how many coins can he store? And who came tot he idea repairing something punching ist head into a wiring board and causing a whole bunch of shorts? Hte whole damn X-Wing should have explodet after that stupid droid did that (sorry, electrical engineer speaking ... tha whole thing was stupid)<br/>5.	Original Trilogy: everything that happened in the original trilogy has been made irrelevant with Last Jedi (and TFA), except fort he meeting of Han and Leia I believe, that I forgot stuff (a lot), but this covers the most stupid things.<br/>I like Disney, I love what Marvel does under the cover of Disney, but Lucasfilm ... sorry, Luicasfilm went for me from one oft he best studios to one oft he worse:<br/>-	Bad Characters<br/>-	Bad Continuity<br/>-	Bad (and lazy) Screenwriting<br/>-	Bad Story<br/>All in all: Last Jedi is in my opinion the second worse Star Wars Movie,the only one worse ist he force awakens (Yes, I thing, that A Phantom Menance" was much, much better than Ep VII and Ep. VIII copmbined .., and Ep.I wasn't even a good movie)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I saw it over a year ago and I am still pissed off about it.  After seeing The Force Awakens, I was so excited to see The Last Jedi.  I could not have been any more violated by this movie. I loved Star Wars and saw the first movie in theaters when I was a kid. My childhood hero was Luke Skywalker. Rian Johnson ruined this movie and burnt the entire franchise down with it. This movie had excellent music and beautiful cinematography, but none of that mattered once the character started acting. The acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous. I felt like I was watching a Star Wars spoof.   Rian Johnson did the one thing that I thought was impossible—he made me not care about the next Star Wars movie.  I won’t go see it now just to protest this terrible film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Juvenile humour that is jarringly out of place for a Star Wars movie, "world mechanics" that are internally contradictory, repeated middle fingers to significant events in the Force Awakens (which made the rebooted franchise fun to watch).<br/><br/>I'm not even hating on the movie for its blatant political messages or gender and racial biases.<br/><br/>This movie is not a Star Wars story, because it gives middle fingers to plot points from the original movies that started the franchise.<br/><br/>If all someone has to do is fly a starship into an enemy at lightspeed, why the hell did the rebels sacrifice most of their best pilots in a new hope on a million to one chance that someone could drop a photon torpedo down the thermal exhaust port?<br/><br/>Light-speed through the death star...problem solved with one death. Luke Skywalker wasn't needed. At all.<br/><br/>Which is the basic point of why this entire movie is not a Star Wars story...Skywalker is unnecessary. The past is meaningless and insignificant. Giving middle fingers to past episodes by belittling amazing plot points is not "innovative, bold and fresh" storytelling; it is not "growth and revitalization" of a franchise. It's a lazy and disrespectful deconstruction of previously brilliant, original, inspired movie-making!<br/><br/>Rian Johnson should be ashamed that he wrote and filmed this. He is now as dead to me as Brett Ratner since X-3.<br/><br/>Dear Kathleen Kennedy. I will never pay for another Disney-Wars movie. I am infinitely grateful I saw this for free at a sponsored screening. The cosmic irony is that Spaceballs celebrated its 30th anniversary this year...considering that a number of themes from it were used in this movie.<br/><br/>My disappointment has rarely been so profound.<br/><br/>The 1 star is for John Williams, the effects guys, and the unfortunate actors and crew that were contractually obligated to make this stinker. The studios, writers, producers and directors get 0 stars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

While I liked the visual, sound, and directing effects; I cannot deny the story felt dodgy to say the least. Most plot elements felt meaningless. I was sitting there at the cinema like “Is this a main line movie, or a saturday morning cartoon spinoff?”. Overall, it can be either as good or as bad as you like depending on what aspects of cinema you value the most.<br/>At the very least I found it entertaining by the end, but it was still a huge disappointment compared to The Force Awakens, which in itself wasn't much to write home about.<br/>It pains me to say this, but The Last Jedi was average, and I'm concerned as to how the final episode might attempt to fix the many holes created by this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Which they called "subverting expectations" and "surprising twists".<br/><br/>The main hero doesn't need to learn anything. She is awesome at flying, fighting, fixing the Millenium Falcon, reading/controlling minds, translating the wookiee language and everything else that is put in front of her. But apparently it doesn't matter why she is so good at all these things.<br/><br/>Luke became a hermit that lives by milking aliens, after trying to kill his own nephew and fleeing to an unknown planet. I can't even describe how disrespectful and unlike the original Luke Skywalker this is.<br/><br/>Their "training" consisted of secret talks with Kylo, scenes showing how powerful and open-minded Rey is, how disturbed Luke has become and flashbacks where he tries to kill his nephew. In fact, there is no training at all. There's something like two conversations about the force and the one that learns something by the end is Luke. Rey doesn't learn anything.<br/><br/>Snoke...it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how/when/why he got so powerful, who he is, how did he get a massive high-tech army capable of conquering the galaxy,etc...<br/><br/>Neither the current director nor the past director knows who he is. All they know is that he is the big bad guy, very powerful, with an immense army. Whatever comes next, Ryan Johnson doesn't have a clue and doesn't care that much.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is a festival of boredom. It's full of fillers and plot holes, with a good fight, an emotional scene and many cringe moments.<br/>I don't know how they managed to make such a bad and disjointed sequel, but they did it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Milking the boob of a space alien and drinking its green boob milk.  The entire Casino scene and sub plot revolving around it. Flying Leia. Killing off Luke.  Sorry, I can not bring myself to even give this movie a 1. I'm not the Force Awakens hater, I actually enjoyed it.  It 'felt' like Star Wars.  but this abomination?

It destroys what I loved about established characters (Luke and Leia suffer most of all). It contains woefully misplaced humour that does not land. It is completely tone-deaf. It contains the universe's slowest and most implausible chase. It contains the most pointless side quest in history. It contains plot holes that cause it to lose internal consistency (eg, Finn drags Tico across an open plain in front of a dozen walkers that are just standing there and survives, because?) and contrivances that break the established workings of Star Wars (The Holdo Manoeuvre). It contains political messages that bring you crashing back to our reality and have the subtlety of a sledgehammer and the crudity of the carbon-freezing facility on Bespin.<br/>Spare yourself the misery of watching this movie if you still can. For me, its ruined any hope of enjoying this sequel trilogy at all and I will not be giving the ST any more chances to make me hate Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I’m not going to do that here because most people dont really care about gaping plot holes if a movie delivers a good time and a solid message.  The other criticisms you hear are about ”poorly written characters”, ”bad sense of humor”, or “pointless side plots”.  In fact, all three of those are symptoms of the underlying nihilism of the film.<br/><br/>REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS<br/><br/>It’s not that the humor in the film isn’t funny. Often, it does make us laugh in the moment, but almost invariably serves to undermine the authority and gravitas of a character, rendering him impotent, which instinctively rubs some people the wrong way.  In the first scene, Poe makes an absolute mockery of General Hux.  How can we take Hux seriously after that? Finn runs around naked in a leaking bacta suit. Chewbaccas power is drained by porgs.  Snokes a joke. Luke’s lightsaber is treated like garbage. And, of course, Luke Skywalker is ruthlessly and vulgarly humiliated at every opportunity. Vulnerability in characters can humanize, making them sympathetic (think about how your felt when Snoke mocked Ren’s mask), but it’s hard to look silly and intimidating at the same time. In contrast, the humor in the original trilogy was almost always either romantic banter or a repair to defuse a tense situation.<br/><br/>Characters seem thin because nothing they do matters and nothing about them matters. Family doesnt matter.  Rank doesnt matter. Relationships dont matter.  Heros dont matter. The most sympathetic character in TLJ is Kylo Ren as he sinks into the deep, abiding nihilism the film celebrates. Let the past die.  Kill it if you have to.<br/>The only thing the good guys have going for them is the Force, which is a stand-in for deus-ex machina.  The Force provides.  Rey doesnt need a family nor a backstory nor training nor wasted time with self-improvement because the Force does all the work for her. There is no true struggle for the good.  Rather, the film posits that there is no good.  No evil for that matter.  Its all subjective. We are all in a galactic hamster wheel in which nothing ultimately matters. THATS the lesson Canto Bight teaches us through Rose and Finn.  Cant find the expert youre looking for? Who cares, there are no experts, anyone will do, any random thief. The Force provides!  Obviously, Rose and Finns mission is an abject failure and they learn nothing. They congratulate themselves that at least they saved the space ponies, but its not like the animals wont immediately be recaptured, and they did nothing at all for the slave children. Its no coincidence that Benicio Del Toros nihilist DJ (Dont Join) saunters away rich without a scratch on him. That guy really gets it!<br/>Look at how the film plays with the notion of self-sacrifice for the greater good, one of the classic hallmarks of a hero myth:<br/><br/>Paige Ticos self-sacrifice is meaningless. The dreadnought is easily replaced. Many rebels die. Poe is dressed down and demoted (but not so youd notice-- his demotion is also meaningless. Whats rank?).<br/>Holdos self-sacrifice is meaningless. The rebel hiding spot is immediately discovered.<br/>Fins attempt at self-sacrifice would have been meaningless, if not for Rose interrupting his effort and explaining how pointless it all is.<br/><br/>The lesson for Kylo Ren was that he should not have allowed himself to be distracted by Luke.  Luke was only an illusion, a relic with no substance, no real power. Apparently, he was all but dead already. If Ren had only followed his own advice and Let the Past Die, he would have triumphed and crushed the rebels.<br/><br/>I learned that since Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm and rejection of Lucas, there has been no master plan for the new trilogy nor its ancillary projects.  Rather, Disney's Kathleen Kennedy has been constructing a multi-billion dollar write-around, with each successive writer/director told to do as they liked, with no regard for continuity, only to be fired mid-stride if she didn't like what they were up to.  Abrams did what he does and constructed a mystery box out of "The Force Awakens", questions without answers à la "Lost".  Now, Rian Johnson, using Kylo Ren as his personal stand-in, has deconstructed and demolished that box and has built nothing at all to replace it.<br/><br/>"The Last Jedi" takes a treasure chest with seven movies' worth of content in it, dumps it in the dirt, shows us the empty bottom, and jokes about it.  We're supposed to admire how clever that is, while not questioning what we are to do with these empty boxes.   Kylo Ren's mission to kill the past is complete. I didn't like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Check, for example, Luke's learning curve in the first three films. The hero is encountered with the unknown, he goes into it, slowly but surely he learns, through many trials, what it is to be a jedi.<br/><br/>Now look at the plot structure in the new films (especially in this one): the hero already knows too much of the jedi powers. There's a total disregard to legacy. When the hero walks into a force trial of sorts, she only sees herself. In the previews film, she already knew some secrets of the force with almost no training. Here, the hero gets a free pass into becoming a jedi.<br/><br/>There is also the issue with the ideology that the film wants to set forth, and worst of all: diversity for diversity's sake. No. In a monomyth structure the key is having the heroes do their work, learn something and with that confront the ultimate plot twist before the resolution. Here I see very little of that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There was no moment of interest, excitement, fun, or fear. It left me with nothing. It's a masterpiece of inverted greatness. It's amazing how it uses an established world with amazing characters and situations and it successfully removes all emotion from everything. I've always considered Highlander 2 the worst movie ever created, but at least I can smile at how bad it is. The Last Jedi is an emotional black hole.

I had to the say the best character's were Luke Skywalker , Leia Organa , Rey , Kylo Ren , Poe , DJ , Finn , and Admiral Holdo. The humor , the action , and the emotion in the Last Jedi is fantastic. It's not a perfect movie it has flaws like the casino scene and Snoke's death don't get me wrong that scene was amazing but now we don't get to know more about him which disappoints me. Overall this movie is fantastic definitely worth for your time. Definitely top 3 in my ranking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Star Wars: The Last Jedi is easily the best or second best Star Wars film--easy. It manages to give us an amazing story, filled with amazingly well written characters, beautifully crafted scenes, and a score by Williams that will make any person shiver with euphoria. Everything on screen and I mean everything is visually gorgeous and hard to top. The Last Jedi is the darkest film in the Star Wars saga and is filled with jaw dropping moments that will leave you speechless--It certainly left me speechless. Mark Hamill returns as Luke and nails it. Carrie Fisher (God bless her) returns as Leia and nails it. Oscar Issac shines as Poe and gets more character development. Daisy Ridely ad Adam Driver SHINE as they give powerhouse performances here. Andy Serkis is always great when he's on screen. Domhnall Gleeson does great here as well. This is a perfect movie, but there is just one downside to it and that involves John Boyega and newcomer Kelly Tran, playing Finn and Rose. They have a storyline here that doesn't fit all too well for parts of the movie, and at some points feel like an entirely different movie altogether. But it can be easily forgiven as it does give us new looks on the Star Wars Universe, plus LITERALLY EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT. The action is incredible, the space battles are star gazing, the lightsaber fights are blazing, and the fights on the ground are blaring. But most of all, this movie tells a story that you will never see coming, not from a mile away. It toys with your expectations, knowing exactly what you are expecting, and the immediately does that and/OR THE EXACT OPPOSITE. Plus, it answers most questions left in The Force Awakens while also leaving oher aspects open. It should also be noted that this movie barely did what The Force Awakens did, as in fan pandering. There's barely a single sign of it here and that goes to show just how passionate the man behind this movie is. Rian Johnson has written and directed the best Star Wars film I have ever seen and it proves why Lucasfilm is giving him free reign on a new trilogy. Rian is a master class filmmaker here and he needs to be recognized for bringing a new story, with hard hitting moments, to life. But most of all, I am excited to see what happens next...Luke was right, "This is not going to go the way you think." I am going to watch it, then watch it again, and again, and again. Thank you, Rian, and thank you, Lucasfilm. And before I go, don't worry Game of Thrones fans, Captain Phasma actually does stuff this time. Cool stuff too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Right off the bat, a space chase like that is not physically viable, basic weightlessness in space means ships would only accelerate and never slow down. There is so many plot holes, needless characters (who is also brilliantly uninteresting)and useless lightsabers (also wrongly named laser swords) bad fights (enemies clearly aiming for weapons not persons) and a plot that make me want to vomit.<br/><br/>Worse then the already garbage prequel. Not to mention a starsystem killing weapon makes no strategic sense, who are you going to rule after blowing up all the people and resources of entire systems? My 10 year old nephew makes better stories, let alone actual writers... Disney did exactly what we all feared, mucked up starwars to a be parody of the "real movies"<br/><br/>The writers and directors should be ashamed. The story makes no sense, the characters make no sense, even the enemies are bad. The big badass snookiiee cant foresee his own death? and his guards are useless (literally dropping weapons and throwing themselves into death) Damn, even the last bit makes no sense, ehmm why huddle outside the BLASTPROOF doors, maybe wait inside and deny the enemy use of the walkers ex. Finn finally getting his moment only to have it taken away (btw how she catch up and overtake him??) DAMN this movie is SO bad! - only the latest Predators movie is worse (but that one really IS worse and death of the Franchise) This is the death thrones of the Star Wars saga coming to a abrupt end. Rouge one gave a glimmer of hope that maybe Disney wouldn't Gak it all up, but Noooo.. Worst movie in Starwars universe, in all time, meta, expanded included (which says a lot)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Whoops,  no that isn't necessary. The characters are uninspired, from the newest to the most iconic. I didn't care what happened to any of them. No one is a leader, everyone is an idiot. If George Lucas were dead, he would be spinning in his grave.  I have seen and love the original 6 movies for my whole life.<br/><br/>I never want to see episode 8 again. Star Wars is dead to me now. I will not be seeing episode 9, and considering that Star Wars is my best loved Sci-fi franchise, that is saying something.  I read the books, played the games (board and computer), drew pictures of the Millennium Falcon as a child and saw all the movies on opening day, including Episode 7 (which was also a huge disappointment but at least felt like it might have been hiding something that I missed...)..<br/><br/>I never will see E8 again, nor will I watch E9.  I could have gotten a bunch of monkeys with typewriters to write a better plot and more compelling characters.  It is almost as if the writer WANTED to piss on the Star Wars lore, just to say he could.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

He is not alone, and the companions decide to seize the opportunity during his pause... and take the shot. The mother, and the rest of the people that was with her, get sucked up by the cold vacuum of space. All seems lost. But then, the mother, the leader of the resistance opens her eyes, extends its hand to the ship, and flies towards it! It's a miracle!<br/><br/>A soldier that has doubts about his loyalty to his commrades and their believes, decides to sacrife himself to buy them a little more time. He is about to get killed, proving everyone (even the audience) that they were wrong, and he is saved by someone, who prefers to take the shot instead of him. It's a miracle!<br/><br/>The resistance is trapped in a cave. There is no escape, as the tunnel just collapsed behind rubble, and the enemy will get them before they can get out. They need more time to clear the rubble. All hope is lost. But wait. Someone appears. A hero of legends! But he was in another planet, in another solar system! He confronts everyone, buying them the time they need! It's a miracle! Oh no! He was a ghost of some kind! We don't have enough time to clear the tunnel! They are coming for us! Wait. The rocks are moving! Are they... flying? It's Rey! She saved us! When did she become so powerful with the force? It doesn't matter. It's another freaking miracle.<br/><br/>Oh no! We were jailed! "I can get you out, and by the way I am a hacker of sorts". Oh no! They are destroying the little escape pods! Our post-leader just went light speed kamikaze and destroyed their fleet (even tough there is no reference it could work that way)! Oh no! Snoke is going to kill us! He didn'trealize that someone is force moving the lightsaber, until it's too late... and he dies.<br/><br/>Do you see the pattern here? In this movie miracles move the plot forward. Not the consequence of actions by the characters. At the end, the good guys are just lucky because someone up there ("up where?" you may ask in space) cheers for some, doesn't care for others, and is playing god. No character development, the set where the movie takes place seems more like an excuse, the bad guys are bad for the sake of being bad.<br/><br/>Oh no! They are making another one!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm gonna leave it at this, the movie has potential if the movie was edited differently and certain scenes were cut out and some deleted scenes were placed in the place of those scenes.  If the casino scene sequence was cut, and Rose ended up being a hacker who was once a criminal and gets them onto Snoke's ship.  So, with that there would be extra time to insert the deleted scene when Rey runs to the village she thought was in danger and has a nice dialogue scene with Luke.  The Last Jedi, while I didn't like it at first, could've been made better if a few changes were made that would've been easy to make.  I'm not part of the toxic fan base that claims this ruined Star Wars, I just think that Rian Johnson would've been a great anthology film director and J.J. Abrams should've directed the whole trilogy.  This is actually what I think LucasFilm wanted, and J.J. didn't want to direct them, good thing he's back.  So all in all, The Last Jedi is a decent and confidently made, but fails to remember that part of making Star Wars is fan service.  I want to see Rian Johnson come back and prove himself with an anthology film, which I believe he is better suited for.  Maybe bring him on to write the Obi-Wan movie with Ewan McGregor and let him make an Oscar worthy movie with good action, like Looper.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie is about failure and the characters’ failures are not due to inherent flaws, but because they make stupid decisions. Finn and Rose get caught by security on the casino planet because Finn crashed the ship. It was established in the last movie he was a terrible pilot. Once in prison they decide to trust an obviously untrustworthy guy, and it ruins Holdo’s plan almost making her sacrifice pointless. Poe had them go on the mission in the first place because he was overreacting to Holdo’s refusal to tell him the plan. He mutinies and ruins her plan, yet he is barely reprimanded. This does the opposite of endearing me to their characters.<br/>I thought Luke’s portrayed was great. The explanation for how he came to that state was too vague. Luke and Kylo’s actions in response to this event seem extremely irational, hopefully we get more context in the next movie. I liked both this portrayal and his original heroic one, so I was very dissapointed at what seemed to me to be a half redemption. He saves his sister, but he fails to confront Kylo honestly or bravely. He humiliated him and died spreading an incomplete image of he was. The galaxy doesn’t need hope, it needs the truth. Luke wasn’t perfect, and that is okay. They should know the truth and continue to hope, fight, and struggle regardless. I very much disliked the way the movie portrays these final scenes as positive when I felt they should be bittersweet at best.<br/>Overall the characters I liked from the last film were made to look foolish. They were at their best interacting with each other, but Poe, Finn, and Rey barely speak to eachother the whole movie. Kylo Ren has a chance to be a different kind of villain and chooses to do the whole “rule the entire galaxy thing”. Snoke’s death was genuinely exciting and this ruined it. There are about a dozen other things I could rant about, but I will end on a positive note. The acting is great and this is definitely the most visually stunning Star Wars movie yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But it could be argued that this is not really a real SW movie anymore, it´s only on the name. Like other people wrote before me, it looks nice (hence the 1 star) but it's boring and way too often illogical/nonsensical. On a side note, it includes quite a lot of subliminal (and at times direct) political, economical and sexist propaganda. This in my opinion does not belong in a good fantasy film supposedly intended to entertain people from all genders, races and political orientations. Certainly it was never part of the SW universe before. But that´s not the worst part. There are many more other deviations in this movie from the SW that we all know and love: changes in old well stablished character personalities, in how spaceships work, in how the Force works, and a long etcetera. The director actually said he was doing everything he could to try to break the SW traditions and our expectations. He did achieve his goal unfortunately, and thus the film lacks any heart that makes a SW film. Why would Disney spend billions buying an incredibly loved and successful franchise and then allow a single producer or a single director to INTENTIONALLY break with the traditions and our expectations of such a valuable intellectual property? We loved it as it was (that´s why they had to pay so much money for it in the first place!) so why the obsession with changing it so much? Don´t waste your time with this trash. Metascore 85. User score: 4.4. That says it all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Yes this is a different Star Wars movie. "Things are not going to go the way you think" Many of the reviewers on the site are salty that their theories didn't come true, and that Luke was a hermit to begin with and not a Grand Master Jedi that the Expanded Universe originally wrote him as. Although, yes he is that, but that comes before this movie. Before the sequels (Although the flashbacks do help show that) Luke is now ashamed for what happened to Kylo, he feels responsible, and hurt. He feels like he let down Leia and everyone else. He has taken full responsibility for it all, he has gone to the island of the first jedi temple to simply get out of the way and die. But that is until Rey find him, at first yes he is unwilling to teach he, but then he agrees, now I cannot wait to see him return in Episode 9 as a force ghost and see Rey take over, who is the true last jedi, and teach a new generation of Jedi. She has the books, Lukes saber, and she is ready to take the screen and fulfill her destiny. Yes at first glance Snoke is a bit of a waste. Most people salty that he wasn't Bane or the Emperor, but it doesn't really matter who he is, or if he comes back or who he was. Kylo Ren has overpowered his master, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, but Snoke was arrogant, and didn't count on Kylo betraying him. Adam Driver did a fantastic job at portraying this. You think he will turn and help Rey, but he tricks her, and try to turn her. All I can say is this film was fantastic. The funniest thing about this movie is how salty people are that their fanfics didn't come true!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Why? I know for a fact this review will be down voted because it's a positive review, I know for a fact i'll be hated for loving this movie, but you know what? This is my review. I know it won't change anything, I know it's just one review, but it is my review, and like those who have given this movie a "10", and a "0", my voice will be heard as well. This is not the worst movie ever made by human beings, this is not the soulless cash grab the world has created, but it is NOT the best Star Wars movie, it most definitely has flaws, and it is far from a perfect movie, but with all that being said, it is still strong. Yes, the opening crawl isn't that good, I think setting it a few days after "The Force Awakens" wasn't an advantage, but after this crawl, we get John Williams amazing score blasting with a gorgeous trumpet chant, and, in my opinion, a funny joke from Poe, and Hux. I much prefer Poe to be a jokester, rather than no nonsense, because A. We have Hux to play the straight man to all of this, and B. Oscar Issacs delivers this moment very well. I think it's alright to laugh in a Star Wars movie, if Han Solo taught us anything. We then get an impressive space battle, and yes I've heard the complaints of the bombs dropping in space, and how the defy the laws of physics, but this is a universe where Lightsabers exist (which defy the laws of physics), and their exists an energy in this universe which allows people to lift rocks, and bend people's minds with the slight of a hand, so pardon me if my suspension of disbelief is a bit more for me to see if this universe didn't create technology to drop bombs in space. Also here, we get a beautiful moment where we see Rose's sister make a heroic sacrifice, and it's done with little to no dialogue, which is the strength of Star Wars.<br/><br/>I know people have a problem with how Luke is portrayed, but it makes sense. How else would you act if you had failed your nephew, and you lost all your students when you were supposed to be the one who were to make them become the next guardians? I know Mark Hamill said he didn't agree with the choices made for Luke, however A. He later stated he was happy with how the film turned out (Amazing how people forget to include that part) and B. Sorry, he's just the actor. Sure he originated the role, but their were other actors who played Luke after him, and their will be more after him. He doesn't get a say over this character, unless he was the writer, and director. That's how it is in Television, Film, Theatre, and Voice Over. I will admit, I will agree with those who don't like this movie about the casino scene, but I won't lie, I am impressed by the mix of practical and CGI, and this obviously took a lot of time and effort to make. The one criticism i'm shocked by is how people don't like Luke's ability to use the force, but what happened if we said the force can't shoot lightning, or couldn't bring down entire ships? We limit what this all powerful force can do. Saying Luke, one of the most powerful Jedi, and THE SON OF ANAKIN SKYWALKER, can't force project himself the across the galaxy is on par with saying the Aliens in "Signs" weakness is wood, and water, it just makes no sense. Look, if you hated this movie, I'm sorry you had such a terrible time, and felt the need to blow up about it, and I hope you won't be this upset again. I will not however agree with how people are treated. I have a friend who was an extra on this movie, and she told me entire shooting days took longer than they should because Rian Johnson was meticulous about everything, he even looked at every extra's costume so a clear character was shining through them. He also loved using practical effects, and she said she saw many people wanting him to use CGI, but he felt it wouldn't be a Star Wars movie if they did so. I will admit, some of the stuff he has said, like the "Your Snoke theory is wrong", is definitely not cool, but anyone in his position would be fighting back, especially if death threats were received.  I love this movie, and that's where I stand, and I'm super excited for Episode IX, and I know fans are making wonderful films like 'Star Wars Theory's' Vader film (still waiting for part 2). I'm happy with what i'm getting from both fans, and Disney, and in the end, was I entertained? The answer is yes. Thank you for reading, and may the force be with you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
