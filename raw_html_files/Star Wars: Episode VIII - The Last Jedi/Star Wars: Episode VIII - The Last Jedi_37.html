I feel they really dropped the ball. We all expected with a big confrontation between Luke and Snoke and got nothing. Snoke was the most undeveloped villain since the Wicked Witch of the East in the Oz prequel with James Franco. The space casino could have worked better if the code breaker and owner was Lando Calrissian. If this was a passing the torch to the next generation of heroes and villains they greatly missed the mark.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This was prequel territory with more than abundant slapstick and shallow characters.   Much of the “new direction” did not feel fresh, inventive or satisfying.  There were a handful of good scenes but most of it felt cheap and deeply disrespectful to the original source.  TFA was a mediocre remake of ANH - but it still FELT like Star Wars.  TLJ feels more like a parody.  Like one of the main plot points, the series may have just run out of gas with no momentum into Episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It had a lot of flaws but fixed many of the problems I saw with The Force Awakens.  Rey is no longer a "Mary Sue" character, Poe Dameron has much more screen time and development, and there aren't as many visual distractions.  With all this comes more problems however.  The main plot is split into two much like Empire Strikes Back, and begins much in the same vein because that's what the director - Rian Johnson - had to work with.  There are times where it feels like a direct ripoff from not only Empire, but Return of the Jedi as well.  For instance there is a scene where Rey gets captured on purpose to try to turn Kylo Ren, but Ren takes Rey prisoner, much like Darth Vader did with Luke, and takes her to Snoke.  Snoke then mirrors Emperor Palpatine's role nearly down to the exact lines, and Kylo Ren ends up saving Rey to kill Snoke.  This was such a wasted opportunity and I saw it coming from the moment the scene began.  The sad thing is both Kylo and Rey had more trouble with Snoke's guards than Snoke himself!  There are other cases where the sense of urgency just isn't there when you think it should be, such as with the fuel crisis.  Finn and Rose seem very content to spend time enjoying the scenery on the Casino planet when their entire fleet is on the verge of being wiped out in mere hours.  This is a scene that could easily just be cut down or omitted completely for the better.<br/><br/>Where the film truly shines though is the final act on the salt planet (I forget its name).  The imagery and cinematography is second to none, and the way the salt turns red as the speeders run at the AT-ATs is absolutely stunning.  The final battle is also well done, but I wish Luke and Kylo would have actually dueled instead of Luke dodging all the swings.  Overall the film was decent.  I liked it better than The Force Awakens but it definitely doesn't top Rogue One or any of the original six films bar episodes I and II. Episode IX definitely has a lot of work cut out for Star Wars to regain its footing, but I'm sure JJ Abrams is up to the task.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

We all thought: "Hmm, who's this supreme leader snoke? where does he come from? how strong he's connected to the force?". But then he gets killed by his student who haven't even finished his "apprenticeship". Supreme leader snoke is not frightening in any scene and is now replaced with this young boy who doesent know if he should cry or kill anybody around him.<br/>- All Star wars movies nowadays need this cute little alien-animals, and then have to show them 10 times<br/>- Some jokes are ridiculous --> Like Luke throwes the light saber away, after 1000 laser shoots Luke scratches his shoulder, the joke Leia brings about her hair when he meets Luke... thats just a few of them. This only shows that Disney doesen't take the franchise serious. It must be funy in most of the scenes, even if it fits or not.<br/><br/>I am not looking forward for episode IX. All of you, who may like this movie that much, are in my opinion new fans who don't care about the older trilogys or blind fanboys who take everything disney will throw at us the next 10 or whatever years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Still haven't forgiven Disney for disregarding almost everything from the EU as "Legends" just so they could make room for their own **** story and characters. The prequels may have had bad acting (mainly anakin) but at least they were ambitious and built upon the Star Wars Mythos instead of whatever the **** the The Last Jedi is working towards story wise. Also you had a perfect setup from the EU with Darth Plagueis that would have connected all 3 trilogy with the Skywalkers together but nope no backstory at all....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

TFA did such a good job with Solo and Leia feeling like they were older versions of their original trilogy selves, but in TLJ Luke and (even Leia) this time around just were just new characters played by the actors we are familiar with. New characters were introduced for no reason other than to kill off somone Disney is trying to make us have an emotional connection to (why didn't Ackbar get to crash the ship, true fans would have been into it, and that plot point was used in the 3rd Aftermath book).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

So if you are not that into Star Wars, you will have a good moment and you'll enjoy this movie. But as a huge fan of Star Wars, I'm a bit worried. Like the VII, this movie doesn't add some interesting facts to the SW universe, and many question asked in the VII are still unanswered: Knights of Ren? Origins of Snoke? Moreover even if it's better done than in the VII, there are still copied-pasted scenes from the original trilogy: there is the equivalent of Hoth, Obi-Wan's death, The Emperor and Darth Vador vs Luke, the elevator from episode VI, rebels'escape from Hoth, the cave from Dagobah... and that's so sad. When will Disney offer us a new Star Wars? But with RO and episode VIII, they took more risks. Maybe IX will be a true SW, but isn't it too late?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Now some people don't like the movie because of some scenes that are in the film and now thats fine not everything works in the movie however there are still some many good scenes that really work. Some story elements are amazing for example Snokes death is one of the best points because it puts Kylo Ren in command of the First order, I feel like this because I really don't think that you need a Palpatine type character in every trilogy. Now I'm not gonna spoil any more of the movie. Now there is something that the people must remember and that is you cannot instantly judge this movie immediately after you come out of the theater. 9.5 star destroyers out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie is a bad sitcom comedy, the only thing missing was the fake audio laughter after a bad joke. I mean im still in shock at how bad this movie was! When looking at a movie you pay attention to the fan reviews not Hollywood. When looking at a video game review you pay attention to the critics not the fans. I wonder if the power of Disney has forced some reviewers hands as I cannot believe the positive reviews I've seen. Awful, truly awful.

It felt like a huge **** you, we know your gonna see it.It was an insult to the fans intelligence. I literally can not think of a worse movie in terms of failing to deliver. This was incoherent garbage. The story was cut and paste of 5 and 6 scenes with new characters that suck ass and have not been developed at all and I could care less if they all died. The only thing that could have made this movie worth watching is if every single new character was killed off. I ****ing hate Rey, Finn, Poe, The Random Chrome Trooper(that serves no point whatsoever), Kylo(a big baby **** that I feel no reason to fear as a dark figure) the General for the First Order(a joke of a character) and can we please stop with the whole women are unstoppable and men are idiots feminist tripe. Sometimes people are dumb and sometimes they are smart it isn't restricted to sex and race. This was total **** I wish I could get my money back. Also, Finn and random janitor girls entire story was useless. It did nothing but to serve some sort of PETA/evil 1% rich people talking point for the virtue signalling Hollywood left crowd. Propaganda isn't art. It doesn't make it through the test of time because it isn't honest with its story.

What's that you say?  To further develop and play out characters and situations that started in the previous episode while carefully handling beloved characters that have been used throughout the entire series?  Don't expect to see too much of that.<br/>I don't think this director has ever watched all the Star Wars movies. This movie has little and desperately needs soul, heart, and drama. If you can get past the slapstick humor(why is that in here?), characters behaving completely un-characteristically, and plot devices that have no business being in this movie, there are some absolutely beautiful cinematic imagery on display here.  Most of the moments that should have been very dramatic, sentimental, and emotional were completely mishandled and shallow.  All the care that Abrams(SW7) and Edwards(R1) put into continuing this story arc is completely wasted here on comedic devices.<br/>Where does the series go from this one?  I can't even imagine.  Still not the worst part of this series.  Episode 2 takes that crown for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie deserves a zero just for what they do with Luke, or rather the missed opportunities with one of cinema greatest heroes. Watch the bland new characters participate in pointless plots while Luke and Leia are mere props for a non-existent story. The humor at first is refreshing, but soon becomes tiresome and makes everything a joke. Rian Johnson wrote a third tier fan-fiction that doesn't make any sense. Uninspired, it feels a times like a botched remix of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi without understanding what made those movies great. There is so many cringy moments, like this random kid force-grabbing a broom followed by a close up of his face watching the stars. It's long, we don't care about the characters and just keep watching for this moment we think it's going to happen that's going to make it worth it, but it just gets worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I really love Star Wars and have no problem with making big changes in these movies. However they need to make sense and flow with the story line. I have no problem with surprises either. This movie was the worst of all the Star Wars I have ever seen. The actors in my opinion did a really good job. The problem was the story, it was all over the place. My biggest issue lies with the way Luke Skywalker was handled. Luke being a bad ass was snuffed out and died in the worst possible way a movie could. Luke going to an island to hide and no backstory to discuss what hes been doing, or anything makes things even worse. Luke continues to wander off and dissapear, to suddenly show up again with Rey. I like Reys character and agree with the direction they are going with her, but her character was underdeveloped as well, back to Luke. All Star Wars fans know Luke is extremely powerful and wise. This movie makes him appear to be a lowly old man who has nothing going for him, and has a pitty party. Then to make things worse, at the end of the movie, he suddenly shows up out of nowhere as a projection... Really? This is the worst part. If your going to kill Luke fine, but he dies on a rock after not even fighting Rey in real life. There is no honor in the way Luke dies, he may be giving the resistance time to flee, but hes so powerful he could have did some extreme damage to the FO. I had a bad feeling when I heard of Rian Johnson directing this movie. People praised movies like Looper, that was garbage and mostly everything else hes done. Hopefully JJ Abrahms can save Episode 9. Severely dissapointed with this movie. I will compare TFA, to this movie. When I went to see TFA, there was a standing ovation and people were really excited by that movie after it ended. When this movie, the look on peoples faces and people talking how badly this movie was said it all. There was no standing ovation, there was no clapping at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I had very low expectations for Episode 7 and it was good, but I felt it was lacking. Rogue One was my favorite movie since the originals, and now Disney has delivered a work I believe deserves a place in my top three. This is the first movie that I feel actually scores on par with the original three movies. Do not listen to the naysayers. Frankly, I've read the bad user reviews and I cannot find any coherency in the outrage, nor do I share any of their opinions.<br/><br/>This movie does something that Star Wars has been lacking since the original 3 movies. It stands alone, yet is part of a greater story.<br/><br/>SPOILERS TO FOLLOW:<br/><br/>I have heard people complain about the casino planet. I found it refreshing that Star Wars would take on something as cerebral as arms manufacturers and point out that wars are always armed by the same people who are just exploiting division.<br/><br/>I have heard people complain that Snoke was wasted....... Snoke was never necessary in the first place. We didn't need another emperor. They could have just brought back clones of the true emperor. There was so much emotion in the scene with Snokes death. It was the perfect end.<br/><br/>I've heard people complain about Luke, but these people have obviously never explored any of the written works that were once cannon and are not now. Luke was always going to be tempted by the dark side and haunted by it well for he removed all the instruments of the dark from the universe (except for Snoke, whom I believe was a terrible character to begin with and one of my pet peeves from Episode 7. However, we could have used a little more back story, but I digress). There must be balance, and without balance Luke starts seeing the dark in Kylo Ren. He almost strikes Kylo down in anger. Brilliant. Luke was never perfect. I wanted to see his flaws, and this installment did not disappoint.<br/><br/>I've heard people complain that Luke didn't show off his power. What do you call him appearing from across the galaxy as he meditates on the ocean world of Ahch-To. I mean come on, not even Yoda pulled off a stunt like that. I'm glad they didn't have him bouncing around like a buffoon the way they did with Yoda in the prequels. I love the fact that they refocused the Force as a religion, and that Luke becomes a proponent of the death of the old religion. There has to be balance. The Jedi were not balance. The Jedi lead to the Sith. There answer is somewhere in between, and I hope that Episode 9 expands upon this.<br/><br/>All in all, Episode 8 is now top 3 Star Wars movies of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Even among those that did not enjoy the movie, many still agree that it is exciting and well acted. Most who didn't like it tend to take issue with its near disregard for the sanctity of the series.  It is a challenging movie, a movie that exists in a moral grey area when Star Wars largely up till this point has dealt in absolutes, blacks and whites.  But to me that is invigorating.  The prequels were criticized for their poor special effects, poor plotting and dialogue, poor acting, and overall not "feeling" like Star Wars movies, with the exception of Episode III which began to approach the feeling of the original trilogy.  We want a movie that feels like the original trilogy, many fans said.  Then came along The Force Awakens, with great actors, great dialogue, great practical effects and sets, and which returned the series to the kind of story and plotting fans had been asking for.  But then came the criticisms that it was too derivative, played things safe, and didn't try anything new.  Now with The Last Jedi, we have a movie with the fine acting, spectacular action, practical sets, shot on film, which takes risks, moves the series in new directions, and broadens our understanding of the force, the light and the dark side, and what it means to be a hero.  Yet there are criticisms - how dare they change this, how dare they make this character act in this way, how dare they challenge what I thought I knew...it hardly seems fair to me.<br/><br/>I believe there exist fans who did not like the prequels, who thought The Force Awakens was too derivative, and now are up in arms about The Last Jedi.  To any fan that finds themselves in that position, I ask: what do you want?  I do not mean that flippantly, but genuinely.  What is this Star Wars movie you have in mind that you have yet to see?  Because if only the original trilogy is worthwhile in your estimate, than perhaps you do not like the movies as movies as much as you like the fandom that comes along with them.  The original trilogy is not perfect, and a lot of criticisms that have been directed towards the prequels and the sequels should, and have been directed at the originals.  They are intentionally derivative of older works, much of the special effects do not hold up, the acting is often suspect, and on and on.  But they are fun, and they are cherished, and they mean something to many.<br/><br/>I think the problem with Star Wars is that its such a huge universe full of so many possibilities, that sometimes when something in the universe doesnt conform in the way an individual imagined it should, it makes them very upset.  But if you asked 100 different fans  what should happen with a certain character, or which direction a certain plot should go in, you might very well receive 100 different answers, so how do you begin to please everyone.  You can't so you have to make the movie you would want to see, and hope that its a movie that resonates with the fans.  In this case, I think Johnson made the movie he would like to see, which is one that does not play it safe and which challenges its audience to think, consider, and discuss.<br/><br/>If you have not yet seen the movie, I would suggest going in with an open mind, and trying to enjoy where the movie takes you, not dwell on how closely the movie confirms to where you hoped it would take you.<br/><br/>And if you dont like it, and you didnt like TFA, and you didnt like the prequels, then I guess you'll just have to write your own Star Wars script and try to get it made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The conflict, pain and suffering never felt real.  So many things wrong with this film and it could have been salvaged a little by simply making Luke do something truly bad ass.  I left feeling empty and unexcited for episode IX, JJ Abrams has a tall task ahead of him to take this steaming pile that Rian Johnson left him.  There needs to be a new villain introduced in Episode IX 100% more bad ass, feared and scarier than what Kylo Ren is.  So bad.

The plot was horrible, character development was minimal and some of the special effects were terribly rendered.  Since when can Princess Leia fly through space???  Come on, I know we have to suspend disbelief sometimes but WTF.  I would rank this tied with Episode 1 for last or maybe even dead last in the series.

Here's why the 1 score;<br/>-Luke milking an alien and drinking the green cum outta it; unecessary and disgusting, who thought of that!!?? fire him!! Its going to be the mark where the good Star Wars end!..like..''hey, you remember the **** Star Wars?...uhn the one with the alien milking scene!??'' WOWWWW that suck<br/>-All the heroes are super weak, except Luke at this one moment. Dies in a boring way. Other heroes all fail miserably..why making a movie about it??<br/>-This movie goes no where; nothing is explained from E7 plus you know you wont get any real or good answer later.<br/>-Dark side isnt much dark at all and the bright side, not so good. I feel like Kylo and Ren should really work together, Kylo did save Ray!..no trust but whatever, confusing still. Bad dialogue.<br/>-New annoying that shout and does nothing else. Jar Jar bink did have an army to fight at least and played a significant role. This is just for sale gimmik but its too much ''in your face cute so buy toys''<br/>-Yoda set the fire to explain things to the old Jedi tree and say its stupid books...I mean is just that to learn the force!!?? They missed a huge opportunity to add depth to the Jedi training and origin...no explanation except old books. What a let down.<br/>-Rebel star pilot dont do nothing and no mission, except Leia making him look stupid. Another let down on a hero.<br/>-Casino scene...dont know what it brings to the movie.<br/>-Kylo is stupid and weak and so Ray, but Snoke is the joke of the century...the 'not so great Snoke' ahhahaha<br/><br/>The more i thnink about it, the more it deserves a 0, but I'll give it a 1 because there is some badass effect, but Star Wars is over for me. I'll wait for better movie on Jedis and Darth whatever, but not part of this stupid story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Maybe I'm just sick of Star Wars? I just don't care anymore, about the characters or the story, tbh I only watched it so that the inevitable month long RLM cash in material makes sense.<br/><br/>Talking of making sense, spoilers... But why did the baddies spend the entire middle of the film milling about waiting for the goodies to go on adventures (which lead no where) rather than just blowing them all away? We're the goodies too far away? Couldn't they warp speed in front of them?! Also if the goodies can man an entire battleship with one person and fly it into the baddies main ship, why didn't they do that to begin with? They wait til the entire fleet is destroyed before evacuating and kamakazing their big one?! And if Luke was going to push up some flora why didn't he come along in person and do it it would have been the same result and not looked like a weird force illusion thing which was stretching the mumbo jumbo a little far already with the vision chit chats earlier in the film? Also if you're going to knock off an old member of the cast as a sacrifice why not do that with the character who's real life counterpoint has passed? Was that too distasteful? More distasteful than replacing actors with CGI zombies?<br/><br/>Oh I don't care, I don't even want to know the answers, I don't care about the remaining characters enough to come along for 9. I'm out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The fact that many fans aren't appreciating it, is how you know it was a different, unexpected and high risk-taking film. Smarter, less "black and white" and more complex than any Star Wars film before it. Gives each and every character (new and old) a ton of dimension, deep motives and a reason to empathize with, even the wildlife and droids. Characters that were lame in The Force Awakens now have plenty of reason for us to care for them, and have worthy subplots that will be stuck in your mind long after viewing. Everyone is greatly tested. The film takes the series to new places, cracks open the flaws of Star Wars lore and questions them, further strengthening the story of the saga as a whole. The film has huge personality, not afraid to make fun of itself and to cast aside dopey fan theories in a way that feels almost meta. If you are a huge Wars fan but also desire something new from the series, this is your film.

It is more irredeemable than Darth Vader.  Incredibly poor character development with little to no plot development.  The film focuses on forced humor and sight gags at the expense of advancing the story or developing the backgrounds of the characters.  I have not been this disappointed since the Matrix sequel.  It will take a lot to save this trilogy in Episode IX and my expectations will be very low for that film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Empty. Basically, nothing of any consequence happened, whatsoever. Every major major plot thread was tossed out, and while I appreciate the attempt to bring something new to the table, I think it failed badly. Rey was boring and predictable, and the interesting possibility of her going to the dark side or going more grey was a completely blatant red herring. There were multiple character death fake outs, which simply existed to create cheap twists. Character motivations were vague at best, and non-existent at worst. There were tons of things going on, which mostly existed to pad runtime and make you feel like there was actually some sort of progress. The porgs literally served no movie purpose whatsoever, and weren't even introduced in any meaningful way. They just existed to sell plush toys for Disney. The only redeeming factors were Kylo Ren being an intense, layered, complex character, and Luke being equally well written. Additionally there was THAT great scene with Kylo and Rey. Those are the only things to redeem this movie for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke dies fighting han solos boy with fake psychic connection after he destroys jedi academy with the help of Yoda, Capt Phasma dies by falling down fighting the idoit Finn, crazy annoying ugly Asian chick like Margaret Chao (Rose) that should have been killed off immediately & then sticks around the entire movie and falls in love with Finn (lame) good actress horrible writing, luke squeezes the tit of a cartoon animal and drinks its milk (I almost walked out of the theater), Rey's parents were nothing more than drunks that sold her for alcohol says Kylo during their fight(lame) -should have been Luke & Leigh's daughter 'accident' xD Princess Leia dosent die (surprising) since she actually did die and took her real life mother with her (Debbie Reynolds). We learn absolutely nothing about Snoke when Kylo Ren kills him to save Rey by cutting Snoke in half with light saber in the middle of the movie. Really good fight scene with Rey and Kylo against the elite force (red guys) in Snokes chamber afterwards. The movie had some good parts but overall it was a train wreck of different stories jerking you back and forth. The ending was Leia escaping with Chewy and a small group of the rebels and her calling for a new beginning of the Rebels effectively ending the original star wars story, and creating a new one for children with fuzzy animals that can be sold at retailers. Star Wars is officiallly dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

General Leia gets a time out while never before seen purple haired queen beeatch of SJWs takes command. Rey teaches herself to Jedi like I predicted, still stutters repetitious line after line, simply refuses to earn any heroine creds aside from the fact that she has vagina. Snoke is a joke, cgi puppet still with no backstory after 2 friggin years becuz Disney and all its money couldnt pay someone to think of anything creative. Kylo is still a lame potato faced juvenile prick. The story writers still allow the annoying ginger from the last flick to live. Snow + AT-AT check. Force grab lightsaber check. Cosplay comicon level fight choreography check. Asian lesbian lovers ahem sisters check. Interracial couple check. Chewy gives up meat check. its just goes on and on. Nothing of value was learned or discovered regarding story or characters. Yoda jumps in out of nowhere to burn the foooking Jedi tree, heckles Luke and calls him a loser. Shame on you Disney. Its turning into the same BS that's ruining Marvel comics(not the movies)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Big spoilers ahead. A total, unmitigated disaster. If TFA was an adaption of A New Hope, then TLJ is the cheap Chinese knockoff version of Empire, with some ROTJ sprinkled in. Hard to believe they followed up Rogue One with this pile. I am struggling to figure out how a 2.5 hour-long film could have so little story, character development, or purpose. TFA was never going to win an Oscar, but at least it left you wanting more, and with some pretty intriguing questions to be answered. Instead we learn nothing about Rey other than that she apparently already knows everything she needs to be a Jedi with zero training. We learn nothing about Snoke except that he is disposable, and his lame death feels more like Rian didn't know what to do with the character rather than a serious attempt at a decent twist. Luke Skywalker has been butchered, and has more in common with the angsty Anakin of the prequels than the learned Jedi we saw at the end of the original trilogy. The film is littered with cringe-inducing attempts at humor and cuddly CGI critters (including crystal dues ex foxes). The entire casino scene should have never made it to the final cut, and del Toro's much-hyped DJ had maybe 5 minutes total screen time. Leia miraculously survives a huge explosions and force-jets around space, surviving the movie in order to presumably make a creepy all-CGI appearance in the next film, supposing they even have a next film thought out. Instead of well-fleshed out characters and interesting subplots, we are treated to a very rushed and very forced love story between Finn and Rose (not to mention that their entire quest is completely unnecessary, adding nothing to the story other than the "revelation" that arms dealers supply both sides, I guess). Plot armor everywhere, Leia has it, Finn has it (his attempt at a heroic sacrifice towards the end would have at least added depth to his character and given some weight to the film, but not in Rian's world). Meanwhile Snoke is wasted, I'm not even sure what the point of Phasma was other than to sell action figures, CGI Yoda looked better in the prequels, etc... Just a massive, all-around disappointment. One further note, on the widening discrepancy between the critic reviews and the user reviews... The Disney-Fox merger gave the company control of 40% of the box office. If you are a professional film critic, are you really going to risk access to 40% of the pre-screenings for new films by thrashing Disney's yearly moneymaker? RIP Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Some scenes were unconvincing. Princess Leia flying as super man or the cute animals with the wookie (added so Disney can sell stuffed animals I literally thought when I saw it). Others felt they served no purpose like the weird scene with the "mirrors" in the cave. Many scenes felt rushed like Darth Vader taking off his helmet (I was wondering why that even was important?) and the emperor being killed 2 minutes after he was introduced. There was enough storyline for 3 great movies but they pushed into one while being boring and unconvincing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The master was reluctant to train again. The pupil ran off early again. The good guys flee again. The At At assault on the white planet happens at the end of the movie instead of the beginning to really shake things up.<br/><br/>We are in the some spot as the end of the last movie. Rey is the all powerful good guy who we already know can easily beat the bad guy Kylo. They have no answer for Snoke or why the empire off shoot has overthrown the new republic. When people talk about trying different things, being weird, and the outlier for Star Wars films, they are talking about story teases and set ups they didn't have the guts to pull the trigger on. Nothing new, weird, or fundamentally different lasts more than 10 minutes, and the film always quickly returns to safety. It is derrivative of Empire and Battlestar Galactica with no new novel ideas for it's time and had none of the plot turns those stories had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

To think The Force Awakens movie was a let down The Last Jedi is even worse! I'm no movie expert but I know the writers of this movie were consistently lazy! All the fake spoilers that were written by average people on the internet had way better plot structure than this multimillion dollar shlock!<br/>I'm giving this a big fat 0, but it doesn't matter anyway since this movie will do well at the box office because of the name alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

"The Last Jedi" is titled the latest entry in this huge galaxy. Dynamited controversy arose at the time when it was announced officially and publicly the name of this episode, causing hundreds of suspicions and therefore theories that connected and disconnected hypothesis about whether a possibility would be provided to find more than one Jedi in the tale. Did they allude Luke Skywalker as the last one? End the Jedi? Who are Rey's parents? What has the real reason Kylo Ren murdered his father? Is this movie featuring a new lightsaber color? Will Finn and Poe have a more personal relationship? Thousands and thousands of attractive questions came up on the web daily, Internet-using fans who theorized about the possible course of the second part, in which most of their questions have been solved.<br/><br/>As an advice or a warning, there is a great surprise factor — of the many — that will replace the death of Solo in the previous installment, IE, this flick keeps shocking cardinal events for the course of the story that will leave you on the edge of your seats, with an analogue or more powerful impact that this one of Ren hurting his father's torso with a vengeful lightsaber. What is this obsession Mr. Vader has for killing characters with lightsabers?<br/><br/>Regarding the new adds in terms of characters, three roles are those that stand out in importance and presence. The first one is the aforementioned Rose Tico, a three-dimensional maintenance worker introduced in a key point and although it presents absolutely nothing of her past, she stars one of the most poignant and deeply romantic scenes of the franchise. The second one concerns Golden-Globe-nominated Laura Dern, who, thanks to Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, must be placed at the forefront of the Resistance. Her tenacity and courage make this woman a fundamental character for the progress of the story, while on the way delivers a sophisticated, determined and as always superb Dern. Finally and personally the most unexpected participation is Puerto Rican Benicio del Toro's performance. Surrounded by complete secrecy and theories, DJ, the character played by "Sicario" actor, is a kind of intergalactic mercenary, corrupt moral, an expert in deciphering ultra-confidential codes. Currently, one of the most potential roles for following installments.<br/><br/>Technically, just wide-open eyes. The creative journeys the film proposes are irrefutably evocative, captivating and professionally realistic, enabling a thorough immersion in the voyage. Cinematography doesn't go far from its predecessor, however, it's important the radical change that gives Steve Yedlin for the pictures; Camera angles and movements (characteristic of the films) harmonize  different technical components of the film, making a drastic improvement at the cinematographic level, the movements are more intimate and personal, there are a greater presence of close-ups, fast and dynamic movements in the battles and dolly variations or precise approaches in situations where more than two characters are on screen.<br/><br/>John Williams, the always perfect John Williams. Master in compositions of sound masterpieces, the score manufactured for this film is, without hesitation, one of the most melodic, portentous and powerful of the entire franchise. Staying on traditional strings, the composer manages to beautify each scene with his traditional symphonies, melodies that are masterfully joined with the advance of the story. Ineffably, I had an inexplicable connection with the soundtrack of this feature film, it was something wonderful to listen again the emblematic anthem of the saga at the beginning, that made my heart stop, an act that would be repeated a couple of times later. Bravo, Maestro.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson's "The Last Jedi" leads the spectator placidly into a legendary voyage of lies, revelations, and transformations motivated by an unexpected comical touch, an important social message, first-class performances and an unforgettable score, sadly, the script doesn't end up being perfect and although it manages to resolve many of the unknowns of the previous installment, doesn't propose others as a substitute, any of them is sufficiently suggestive to keep in suspense the devout fanatics during two years before the arrival of the last movie. With unaccustomed twists in the genre, risky but well-received decisions, Johnson makes his official letter of presentation to the galactic universe, one in view of knowing the new trilogy that is in the hands of the promising filmmaker. Without fear of being wrong, the director will get great things for "Star Wars" future, for now, has created and delivered a great Christmas gift: magnificent action sequences, moving performances and a more acute and intimate analysis of the already legendary characters: We love Rey, Finn and Poe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I felt teased from the first minute, to the last.<br/>Here's some bu****it you can find in this abortion of movie:<br/><br/>1)A phone joke in pure Scary Movie style;<br/>2) Ok, it's a sci-fi movie, but the bombers that drop bombs such as in WWII... In the space? I didn't know that there's gravity in space;<br/>3) Leila resurrects and flies into space: an awful mix between Superman and Marry Poppins;<br/>4) Luke launches the his elder lightsaber in the sea, such as in comedy by Laurel and Hardy;<br/>5) Luke from a mature and reflective character, being transformed into a rebellious, obnoxious and pathetic old man;<br/>6) Luke shrugging when " the camels" end up shooting him;<br/>7) Luke winking in camera, like John Belushi  in Animal House;<br/>8) Non-stop jokes and moments of humor inopportune, out of place and embarrassing;<br/>9) All villains totally dumb;<br/>10) General Hux who's not scary; he's even teased by his soldiers and brings others comedy moments totally out of place in a Star Wars movie;<br/>11) Kylo Ren, should be the super villain of the trilogy; instead, he is a nefarious kid who fails to be respected by his subordinates and is almost killed by some species of ninjas that are not mastering fully the Force;<br/>12) Snooke, should be the mind of the First Order, everyone wondered what was his past etc... Is dismissed ridiculously, immediately after giving the impression of being very powerful. Perhaps they didn't even know how to justify this character;<br/>13) Captain Phasma...A Character just invented only to sell silver plated soldiers, totally useless for narrative purposes;<br/>14) What is the meaning of a person staying on the rebel ship just at the very end? Once you have to sacrifice, why do you not immediately make the kamikaze move, instead of getting dozens of ships destroyed in a useless pursuit?<br/>15) Being  given of the vast fuel supplies of the empire, why do their ships not increase their speed a little bit? Are there only light speed and snail speed in the galaxy?<br/>16) Rey was a padawan for  less than 10 minutes;<br/>17) Rey already mastered the Force and the use of the lightsaber; she was born learned of course;<br/>18) The Force used such as Skype-calls;<br/>19) The movie starting with Rey and Finn looking for each others; then the arrival of the "chubby Rose" is enough to create a new magical love triangle? Guess who will Finn finally choose of the two?! Can't wait to see it...<br/>20) Finn and Rose saved, by pure chance, from the bad copy of Lando Calrissian, and in less than 6 hours they manage to fly on different planets, escape from prison and get to the ship of the First Order;<br/>21) An immense clump of characters, useless, except only for Disney's merchandising;<br/>22) The nuns frogs;<br/>23) The screaming chickens, repeatedly;<br/>24) Luke, who dies of heart attack after doing the spooky ghost;<br/>25) An ending that never comes (unfortunately);<br/>26) Flashbacks that do not exist in original Star Wars, 'cause they are not Star Wars;<br/>27) Forced scenes, shot specifically made to subvert the very few interesting ideas of Ep. 7<br/>28) Stop, I'm tired<br/>29) Leia flying in the space.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I know many have said that it is supposed to be moving in an "exciting" and "new" direction, but I fail to see what that direction is with a half-hearted script, terribly designed secondary characters, enemies that use zero logic, and very little main character growth. Additionally, I enjoy the occasional humorous point in many of the previous Star Wars movies, but The Last Jedi is oversaturated with forced humor. Much of the humor is terribly placed inside scenes that should be keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat, not lulling them into a sense of light-heartedness and security. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, The Last Jedi is a flat, fairly bland Star Wars movie that only has a few moments many Star Wars fans will truly appreciate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not only did it live up to the hype, I honestly believed it surpassed it. The acting from the entire cast had some of the best performances in the entire Star Wars franchise. Specifically, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, and Mark Hamill stole the show. Given the extremely positive critical reception, I would not be surprised if Mark Hamill got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The story and the script were fantastic. I loved the epic three act structure with the "ticking time-bomb" trope driving the action. The humor was excellent! Another thing I must say about this script is that Rian Johnson TRULY understands The Force. None of that midichlorian crap, but the energy that binds everything in the galaxy together. The script was also very surprising, and constantly took twists and turns. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole film. Any fan theories I had or twists I expected were subverted beautifully, and I honestly never knew what was going to happen next. The action sequences were some of the best I have ever seen in Star Wars. Rian Johnson's shots were so beautiful that at times the audience in my theater gasped at what was being shown on screen. The character development was strong throughout, the world of the Galaxy was beautifully fleshed out, and I can't wait to see what happens in Episode 9.<br/><br/>My one complaint with the film is that the subplot between Finn/Rose felt a little bloated and dragged at times. It definitely slowed the pacing of the film, and it could have been cut entirely or trimmed down.<br/><br/>All in all, The Last Jedi is a MUST-SEE for Star Wars fans, and I think general audiences are really going to like this one as well. If you liked The Force Awakens and Rogue One, The Last Jedi feels like a baby that those two films had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Everything with Finn was filler. Unanswered questions from VII were answered but not in a good way. They were essentially written off as irrelevant. Luke milking some random creature then doing a half-assed pole vault to catch a fish? What? The acting was abysmal. The humor was out of place and just insulting to the spirit of Star Wars. A Jay-Z dirty shoulder brush? Really? REALLY? Star Wars practically raised me. It's in my blood. This was just a slap in the face. I'm all for opening Star Wars up and pushing the limits of what we've seen before, but turning it into a Marvel MCU slapstick-fest is not the way to go. It completely sucked any will I had to see how things wrap up.

But in this one, it's so well done and it also brings so many new features and simple but great plot twists that I really don't care at all. Of course Disney will rely on a safe formula, they don't want to do what George Lucas did to the franchise. The movie managed to deliver what the fans wanted to see, expected to see and they also managed to surprise everybody. Maybe they were too hard with Luke and maybe the second act could have a better rhythm or be shorter. Those are the reasons I don't give a 10 to the movie. But it's really good!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Fans will have a hard time accepting that people can change during the course of years. This movie expands the star wars canon in  risky ways. I can understand why some people would get angry at that, but that's not my case. The arcs are amazing (especially Kylo, Rey and Leia). My only issues with this movie are some of Luke's choices throughtout the movie and the fact that even though a lot happens, it's not trascendental. A casual movie goer could skip TLJ, go directly for episode IX and may not even notice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's hard to pin down just what vector to attack TLJ from. There are so many ways in which this film is terrible. Whether it's how, by the end, the title makes no sense, or whether it's how, from the very beginning, the film has NO respect for anyone who liked The Force Awakens at face-value. None of the questions from The Force Awakens are answered, and the ones that are are dismissively waved away with an answer of, "it doesn't matter". The biggest flaw of The Last Jedi is that, by the end of the film, the three main leads STILL have not talked to one another. They're not fast friends as Han, Luke and Leia were. They are complete strangers. Finn and Rei have hugged more than they have talked at this point and it's beginning to be creepy. Finn and Poe's immediate bro-mance was cool in the first film. Now it makes no sense.<br/><br/>The Force Awakens is no an objectively terrible film because all the mysteries it set up are completely ignored and a waste of time. Why is Snoke so mysterious? Who are the Knights of Ren? Waste of time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Two films deep into the trilogy, the film is yet to establish a single new character that has any similar impact as that in the last two sagas. Those characters that were promised to play big roles in the last instalment were discarded in the most unsatisfying manner. It still relies on the OT characters for emotional impact, while at the same time stomps all over what happened in the OT. With some spectacular set pieces and amazing cinematography in places, those who were not that invested in Star Wars previously may find it an enjoyable ride. But a portion of Star Wars fans would find themselves in the same position as Mark Hamill when he first read the script: 'fundamentally disagreeing'.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7848794"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">What a fantastic edition to the Star Wars universe. It is as fun and exciting as any Star Wars movie. It brings a new sense of wonder and mystery to the Force. And yet, at the same time, it wisely dares to explore new themes and to subvert genre tropes.<br/><br/>The haters giving 0 reviews often complain that TLJ is "Disneyfied" and a "kiddie" movie. The major themes of this movie must have flown over their head. This is an uncompromising story about the disappointment and bitterness that encroaches on all of us as we age, mature, and reflect on our youth. Luke's conflict relation to the Jedi is all too familiar to any of us who have attached ourselves to noble but imperfect causes. I don't know too many kids who can relate to that.<br/><br/>It's also the rare adventure movie that allows for the fact that heroics can be misguided. In TFA, Han chooses to go to lightspeed from within a hangar. ("Isn't that impossible?" Rey asks. Han replies: "I ask that after I've done it.") Surprise, surprise: Han's risk works. In contrast, in TLJ, hastily conceived plots don't work out the way our heroes hope. People have pointed out that Finn and Rose's side quest could be removed and the plot would end up in the same place. Perhaps that is the point--although more accurately, Finn, Rose and Poe actually make things worse by compromising Holdo's solid and unflashy plan! As Leia tells them, Holdo cares about the cause, not about acclaim for her heroics.<br/><br/>These thematic elements breath new life into the expanding Star Wars universe. TFA felt like a warm familiar embrace, and I was happy for it. TLJ builds off of that goodwill, but then enters into dialogue with many of our assumptions about the world, themes, and morality of Star Wars. But in doing so, TLJ doesn't cheapen what came before: it deepens our appreciation of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I watched a midnight screening of this movie on Wednesday and I'm really glad I did. Star Wars has always been close to my heart and I normally don't write reviews on sites like these but since I've seen the low score I thought I should throw my hat into the ring. I don't want to talk about the movie scene by scene I just thought I would address some of the most common points of outrage about the movie: a)Yes the movie is funny! I'm someone who checks out halfway through most of the Marvel movies and I still really enjoyed most of the comedic efforts made in this movie. Especially Characters like Poe and also Luke have some great moments in an otherwise very dark atmosphere. b)Luke is not what you'd expect!<br/>If you liked the portrayal of Luke in the EU then you are most likely to be surprised by how he is presented in this movie. But I genuinely think his character makes way more sense that way. This is actually the only point of criticism I understand some people having but in my eyes if you think about what the character has gone through it is way more relatable than the person he is in the EU.<br/>c)People who say "It's the worst movie in Star Wars" are bugging out! There is great character development in this movie, some of the most rewarding and breath taking action in all of Star Wars and some mesmerizingly beautiful locations. Contrary to the prequels CGI is used only when necessary and a lot of great practical effects make the movie a true joy for any real Star Wars fan. I don't believe people can make an actual rational argument for why this movie is worse than the phantom menace or attack of the clones. I watched every single SW movie in preparation for TLJ and I can tell you it's a far superior in almost every aspect. Maybe the most important one being: There is actual emotion in this one!! That's the kind of luxury you get for casting good actors (and actresses, Rey has an amazing story arc) There were numerous times during its 2,5 h runtime that I sat there with an open mouth and could not believe what I witnessed. In a very good way. I knew the movie was gonna be controversial but that's what happens when you try something new with a franchise after the revival was a rehash of the old formula ( don't get me wrong I liked TFA but TLJ is a better movie in almost every way to me). If someone is actually reading this, I hope you go watch the movie with a (relatively) open mind and if someone who has already seen it reads this .... I hope you enjoyed it just like I did!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In SW7, I was excited to see Knights of Kylo, Rey's parents, Jedi's secret. It means nothing in this movie, like Kylo told Rey: "all this small thing is nothing, your parents are nothing, we can restart and rule together." Yeah, those are really nothing in this movie.<br/><br/>2. So, I guess randomly threw jokes into a movie can help to get a higher rating.<br/><br/>3. After this movie, I don't really understand what is "the force", I guess it can be super strong or suck...as long as the story needs it...<br/><br/>4. ...<br/><br/>5. ... I don't know...

And his dialogue is atrocious. Where the **** is force ghost Obi-Wan?!<br/><br/>- This film and the Force Awakens **** all over the legacy of the original trilogy. What was the point if galactic history completely repeated itself 35 years later? Just sad. Say what you will about the prequels but at least there were different scenarios and plot intrigue.<br/><br/>- Misdirection and jokes were extremely over used. - General Hux should be called General Sucks.<br/><br/>- Franchise has become a tiresome bore like Marvel, Pirates of the Caribbean, + Cool that Luke can use the force to great power just by meditating from a planet far from the action to deceive Kylo BUT;<br/><br/>- Leia being Superman to survive open space? Really?! You hacks couldn't think of a better way to display that she is also strong with the force. Talk about jumping the shark or surviving a nuke in a refrigerator.<br/><br/>- Casino aliens did not look Star Wars. Similar to the Force Awakens aliens not drawing from established Star Wars alien races. Like, why Disney? More toys --- **** off.<br/><br/>- Benicio Del Toro's character was a complete waste and throw away.<br/><br/>- The resistance seems to be led by old lesbians. While all the males are either incompetent, impulsive, stupid, cowardly, or evil.<br/><br/>- Admiral Ackbar killed off unceremoniously. - Overly long.<br/><br/>+ Salt planet was cool, cute one liner about it not being snow.<br/><br/>- Caretaker puppets looked terrible. I can't believe I am defending the use of CGI.<br/><br/>- Extended long range force telepathy scenes.<br/><br/>- NO background plot information NOR character development WHATSOEVER.<br/><br/>- Holographic Maz was pointless. Might as well have been Jar-Jar Binks.<br/><br/>- Rey's training was extremely short and supposedly she is the greatest Jedi of all time? I call bull ****.<br/><br/>- Why didn't Hux just take out the Resistance at the beginning.<br/><br/>- Vice Admiral Holdo's purple hair.<br/><br/>- Poe's mutiny for no reason.<br/><br/>- Kamakazis from hyperspace and interrupted kamakazi, thanks Asian girl. I hope you bolster the Chinese box office. - Rian Johnson is a yes-man for Kathleen Kenedy. George Lucas giving her the reins of this was a serious lapse of judgment or perhaps a deliberate means of sabotage after the criticism he got on his prequels which all look like masterpieces compared to this new Disney hot mess of a Star Wars franchise. - So much talk about being the spake of HOPE to light the fire to burn down the Resistance and how Luke is the HOPE blah blah blah, this film literally killed any hope of a good future for Star Wars. **** it. I am out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
