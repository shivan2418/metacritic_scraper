Yes. The Last Jedi is another episode of Star Wars. Pacing-wise is essentially The Empire Strikes Back but with a much blander storyline, beloved characters turned into cannon fodder and real life politics sprinkled all along the movie.<br/><br/>This movie has some of the most hilariously bad scenes in all of Star Wars history, only second to those great dialogues in episode II. Dialogue is nearly as bad as that episode, however we don't have to endure minutes of political debate. Well, in this movie you'll find some filler in the way of a Finn substory that is the most tiresome and boring set of scenes you'll ever see in this types of movies. Even political discourse can be better.<br/><br/>The movie does not well with continuity problems in the beginning and end and ends essentially making the future episode IX something you wish not to see.<br/><br/>The humor is pretty hit and miss.<br/><br/>In conclusion: If you're a diehard fan, don't see this, it will make you really angry with the direction taken by Disney with this beloved franchise. If you haven't seen much, it may be worth a rental or something like that...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Mark Hamill got his acting on point. With that being said, poor choices made the rest of the movie unwatchable. The pacing was out of control. Rey is apperantly already a jedi master, because she can defeat any obstacle: in TFA she beats Kylo Ren while she didn't have ANY training, she is one of the strongest force users luke has seen, she defeats luke in a fight, she defeats all the guards in the throne room and lifts tons of rocks easily for the first time. Rian Johnson made Rey a powerhouse, while she should have been a jedi rookie, a student. The story writing was bad: luke was way less powerfull than he should have been, snoke was killed while he was the most hyped chracter and we had zero backstory on who snoke was and what the knights of Ren are. Jokes killed almost every tense scene, with forced slapstick humor. Plotholes are everywhere, although these aren't the reason it made the movie bad. Rose and Finn story should have been cut and Finn should have been able to sacrifice himself but Rian ruined it by taking away Finn biggest moment that could have made him a hero. So they kill snoke, but let Finn live. Bad, bad choice. Good reviews talk about the "surprise factor", but a sudden plot twist does NOT make a movie good if it is not done correctly. Disney should've let multiple directors sit at a table and and let them create a good story for all sequels, so it doesn't feel the direction of the movie goes everywhere but a logical line. Lets hope JJ abrams can save whats left in the next movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The trailers for The Last Jedi were promising a dark dramatic film where Luke Skywalker is broken and conflicted with himself and on the verge of insanity, Rey is shown asking Kylo Ren to show her her place in this world taking his hand in the First Order...NONE OF THAT HAPPENED.    Instead, the film begins like a Saturday morning cartoon where General Hux(who was an intimidating and powerful character in The Force Awakens)is receiving crank calls from Poe Dameron(who also is very different in this film). The main plot pretty much consists of the slowest high speed chase in film history between The Resistance and The First Order, which is very disappointing because Rey and Luke’s arc which is what the film is named after is taking a backseat to a space janitor(Finn)and a maintenance worker(Rose)flying around the galaxy with some dude named “DJ” trying to destroy a tracker. REALLY???    Throughout the first and second act Rey is attempting to get Luke to return and help the Resistance “Light The Spark That Will Burn The First Order Down” and also trying to figure out who her parents are on the side. This arc was very important in The Force Awakens and is literally thrown down the drain with Rey admitting that she knew who her parents were the whole time. Drunks. WHY??? If the Star Wars Saga is supposed to focus on The Skywalker Family then why is Rey so heavily focused on? She even goes so far as to fall in some pointless “Darkside Pit” and have some trippy dream, all to add up to nothing.    Most of the characters in The Last Jedi are treated very poorly with a few exceptions. Snoke, who was another character who was built up so much in The Force Awakens is easily killed by Kylo Ren when he is teased to turn to the light, which was also for nothing rendering Snoke’s death pointless. Poe Dameron is perceived as some dimwitted “Blow Everything Up Pilot”, who disobeys even the simplest direct orders. Carrie Fisher(RIP)does a terrible job as Admiral Leia, delivering her lines like a robot. Not to mention that she's not dead? Are they just going to have a CGI Leia for the entirety of Episode Nine?    The film is also way too crowded, Maz Kanata shows up for 30 seconds and has no purpose whatsoever. Yoda shows up as a force ghost to try and get Lukes head back in the game, at first I was blown away with surprise and happiness to see them using the original puppet, but now I realize that there was again literally no point of his cameo because Luke doesn't listen to him anyway. Captain Phasma is heavily advertised in the trailers and merchandise and is killed off less than 5 minutes into her appearance.    The moments in this film that were full of potential and promise were quickly shot down with unneeded puns and goofs, Luke tickles Rey with a leaf telling her The Force is trying to connect with her, Kylo Ren tries to persuade Rey with his abs and every time there is a cool moment a Porg appears out of nowhere and does something stupid usually with slapstick comedy.    Sadly, there are little to no action sequences in this film and literally not one, NOT ONE lightsaber duel. And of course the film builds one up, teases it and you guessed it; doesn't deliver. Not only does it not deliver, it gives the film an excuse to needlessly kill off Luke Skywalker.    Nevertheless, The Last Jedi isn't all bad, the cinematography is amazing and Rian Johnson delivers some stunning visuals. There is a JAW-DROPPING flashback with an Evil Luke Skywalker trying to kill A Pre-Kylo Ren Ben Solo. The Set Pieces are spectacular, especially Snoke’s Liar which is home to the Amazingly-Choreographed “Red Room Battle”    In the end, Star Wars The Last Jedi is not a perfect film, in fact, it has a lot of problems with the script and not being as it seems. But, it still is an entertaining film that never gets boring thanks to easy flowing pacing and delivers some very cool and surprising moments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is a bad Star Wars movie though.<br/><br/>However, what this story can't make up for is the terrible story, and terrible character development. Fans want a space opera, not a popcorn action flick. With what started off as a great beginning to a new saga in The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi goes on a completely different tangent. The new characters we met in the previous episode are completely overshadowed by another bevy of extras who take up way too much screen time. We wanted backstories to already existing characters, and we got very little. Rian's direction regarding Luke Skywalker was also terrible. He's a completely different person from who we all came to love, and those changes to Luke's character are not well explained.<br/><br/>It's like these writers and director have completely missed what fans love about the Star Wars universe and related movies. They decided to write their own fanfiction rather than continue a good story. This movie had some really good parts, but it also had a lot of cringey, terrible parts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Some do, too bad there isn't some kind of plot to hold them together.<br/><br/>And by the way, did anyone bother to check Johnson's filmography PRIOR to making him direct a Star Wars movie?  Guess not, or someone would have realized that he mostly had directed cruds, so far (and TLJ is no different).<br/><br/>Nothing in TLJ makes sense, character development goes out of the window in favour of nonsense that is convenient to the specific scene.<br/><br/>Some scenes are plain ludicrous. Most scenes, in fact. And most have nothing to do with the storyline. Sigh.<br/><br/>I can't believe I'm typing this, but TLJ is actually a worse movie than the prequels.<br/><br/>Verdict: Looking for an Actual Director</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I LOVED this movie so much more than Force Awakens, i cried, i laughed, and I THOUGHT during the whole thing, i felt Luke's pain and suffering, and Rey's void and feeling of being lost in the universe. When she says the Resistance needs you to Luke, you know she just wants to get the answers she has spent her whole life wondering about.  Even Canto Bight, despite some awkward scenes was just fine, it did what it did, and we moved on, there is a rich class in the SW Universe, and they profit off war.  Even better, we didnt even the code breaker we went there for, we got the criminal.  Nothing happened the way you expected it to, and it was great!  The longer i watched, the more i realised i had no control over where it was going, and man is that cool, i like a good story that i feel i have to read to know what happens next.  For instance, had Luke been over-powered and Goku-level strength, i would have been ok with it, but i would have left the theatre thinking "oh yeh, duh, luke strong", but instead i left the movie thinking 'Luke loved the lives of others so much, that he removed himself from the universe to prevent the death and suffering of more people, in hopes that the Jedi/Sith issue would go away"...i think alot of the people who have been into star wars for years just wanted fan service, as if they deserved the reward for being fans, but being a fan of sports team means you stay onboard even when they dont win the world series every year.  So ignore the people who were disappointed here, some make good points, but a low rating is not deserved for this movie, it really was very good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Horrible, horrible, horrible plot holes that will require either a true genius to fix or for the whole movie to be scrapped. Some forced nostalgic scenes between old characters do nothing for the movie and feel completely passionless.  Luke...oh Luke. I really and truly feel sorry for Mark Hamill, I heard some of the ideas he had for his character and they were so good...so good and so versed. They made sense and they fit in the Star Wars universe almost perfectly. Luke's newly developed character was shockingly bad! Although, if I start complaining about characters I will never stop it seems in this movie (looking at you Rose). Who the hell is this character, Rose, that suddenly jumped front and centre stage?!<br/><br/>I hold no sentimental or emotional value toward Rose, Poe, Snoke and to some extent even Leia. When Snoke died I did not care, in fact I did care a bit. Why did the poor guy die? What did he do wrong? He wanted to just stop random rebels from destroying and attacking his so called 'First Order'. So what he took in a new apprentice. He actually doesn't care about Han Solo or anyone else...all we know is he hates Luke for 'some' reason, so WHY does he hate Luke?<br/><br/>I'm not gonna go into the plot holes or the rest of the reasons why this was the worst Star Wars episode of all time. In fact, I have already given it enough attention and it doesn't deserve anymore!<br/>The only reason I gave it a 2 out of 10 is because as a stand alone movie, it might not be so bad, even with all of its galactic sized plot holes...(also cause I like Mark Hamill, and also Adam Driver actually seemed to legit show some emotional performance).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The casino scenes went on forever and were nothing but terrible CGI and awful writing.<br/><br/>Why are people so impressed by the visuals? Some of the effects were really good but there was a lot of *really bad* CGI.<br/><br/>The writing in this movie is horrible. I hope I will never see another movie by Rian Johnson. I now have zero respect for anything he does.<br/><br/>I think this is the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I didn't think it was possible to be worse than 'Phantom Menace' or 'Attack of the Clones' but... Yes, if I were forced to pick one of the three to watch, it would never be this one.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan-boy. Number of theories I had going into this movie: zero. Number of "Star Wars" books I have read: zero. My interest in the 'expanded universe': zero. All I wanted to see was a good movie. Instead, I got this terrible tripe that has far too many flaws to even bother listing, here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It had me on the edge of the couch glued to the television screen. I was in love with the show, and I all wanted to do was play Star Wars with my friends and reenact the scenes. The love I have for Star Wars as a franchise has only grown since then. Unlike a significant amount of people who didn’t like the prequels, I did, because it was Star Wars and there was more to learn about it. Now as a 32 year old man; my love for Star Wars has been reignited since the release of The Force Awakens. The first time that I saw the trailer, it sent chills down my spine and I fell in love with it all over again. I absolutely loved the movie and I can say that The Last Jedi was nothing short of that. For those of us that dove into the expanded universe of Star Wars, you know the rule of two. This was a perfect example of that, and Kylo like most Sith apprentices want to kill their master. He was given the opportunity and he took it. Kylo is the perfect antagonist to Rey and I cannot wait to see episode nine. For those of us who are true Star Wars fans, we love that its back and look forward to the release of future stories. The force is limitless, and for those who are complaining about aspects of Leia using the force to float back to the ship, let’s be honest, that’s not the craziest thing you’ve seen a force user do. So, in the end, those of us that are true Star Wars fans, loved the movie and thank Disney for rekindling our love for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Hero's Journey. How can you ever feel a character's triumph if it's not even earned? There are NO stakes to Rey or any character in this story. Everything is "HOW DID YOU DO THAT?!", I don't know, I must be this good. It just reeks of narcissism. Is it any wonder that the fans are divided? This has nothing to do with the Star Wars Lore. It's telling a good story. We were setup from the first film to find out why Rey has these great hidden powers and that she would have to train in the ways of the force. She was going to find out who were her parents. This could have been a great character arc. But no instead we were given characters that wins, and achieve the highest powers without trails, tribulation, and no sense of earned victory. Hense Mary Sue. Good Characters don't just achieve greatness because they are so great, they BECOME great through challenges, real dark confrontations, and it's only when they overcome them they are REAL heroes. Why do people love the old Luke? It's because he had to face so many obstacles and tribulations like that his family was murdered, he had to deal with the truth that his greatest enemy was his father. To face Vader meant he had to face himself. He would have to overcome fear all the way to turning to the dark side. He was the only one to believe that there was good in Vader, all the way till he even convinced Vader himself that he was right. All the side plots suffer this point and I don't need to cover them because the end result is the same. I liked some of the character's personality, but personality is not enough to carry a story. Good character development does.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Plot holes, inconsistencies with previous films and a lack of anything resembling the star wars built up in 1-6 (and even 7). There is clear social manipulation going on when there is such a disparity between critic and user reviews. This film is horrendous in a vacuum, but within in the context of the SW universe its a giant middle finger to every fan of the franchise. Sad times ahead for Star Wars. Like most, I will have to do with the memories of the first 6 films and the quality extended universe cannon that has already been written into books and comics long before Disney took a dump on Star Wars. The 2 is for the music and acting (and so this review is counted in the average user score), both of which while top-notch could not save a horribly written and edited film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Worst film I've seen yet next to Hancock and Howard the Duck. This is what happens when Disney is led by corrupt individuals with an anti-moral agenda contrary to the majority of the people that populate the nation. Control of Disney and Hollywood needs to be more diverse and NOT led people by with immoral ideals. Make the damn movies for their plot lines and not inject stupid anti-religious, certain ethnic guilt propaganda into them. The same goes for the Marvel films. Disney is only going for it's racist bigoted agenda, not for good wholesome family films as was in past times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie just set up Disney to be able to get large amounts of money for the endless amount of Star Wars movies to come, by killing off the spirit of Star Wars, the Skywalker family. So many questions from the first movie that fans were dying to have answered remain unanswered. So many unnecessary moments, most notably the Finn/Rose ark, Rose is a completely pointless character that adds nothing to the story- and is simply a very confusing edition. The death of Admiral Akbar and Luke Skywalker are a complete joke- Admiral Akbar dies for seemingly no reason? They just mention that he died after an explosion, just to kill a beloved character. Luke apparently can just decide to disappear and die because he feels like it. When he died, I was like "what happened? did he really just die", big moments like these are vague and leave the viewer confused. They've killed off Luke, Han (and Leia will unable to be in the next movie). They killed the three iconic, original characters for what reason? To make a point that the new generation is going to fix all of the problems? This might be a good idea- if the new characters were even close to as interesting as the old cast. I can't say I like any of the new characters much. I still don't know what makes Finn so important, he was one of MANY stormtroopers and one day he just decided I don't want to be a bad guy? Can't any stormtrooper just do this? Is there a reason he specifically decided to join the Resistance? This- and many other questions, such as who are Rey's parents, (maybe that just isn't important), remain unanswered. The one protagonist character who had a good death was that lady introduced in this movie (can't remember her name), who sacrifices herself to blow up the Empire's ships. This would be a powerful scene if we cared about who she was. Also I really could not care less about Rey and Kylo's relationship. I hate Kylo as a character since he is a brat and killed his father and attempted to kill his mother (that scene was just very odd), which, someone trying/killing my favorite characters is going to make me hate them- but this movie tries really hard to make the viewer want to sympathize with Kylo. I personally do not. This movie ended with me feeling empty inside, and I really don't expect much from the next movie, but hopefully it can fix some of the terrible decisions Rian Johnson decided to make for this movie. I hate how these movies are pretty much made up as they go along- unlike the original trilogy which took a long time to prepare and make it as good as it was, with a lot of passion. Yes, you can't compare things/expect them to be as good as the original trilogy. But this movie, at times, made me want Jar Jar Binks to come in and fix all it's problems. This is the first Star Wars movie I genuinely disliked. Even the prequels, I thought had very good moments, and they did not RUIN the experience of watching the Original Trilogy for me. Whenever I go back and watch the originals- I will think about how Star Wars has become a cash grab, and all of the original characters were  and killed off to try and make a "surprising, edgy" and "unique" movie. I agree with what Mark Hamill said- I disagree with every decision they made with Luke Skywalker in this film. I disagree with him NOT BEING in the next movie (assuming he is not, because they seemed to make it clear that he is dead). That is a huge missed opportunity. They introduce Han in the last movie, and Luke in this movie- and they kill off both of them? To make Star Wars "fresh"? Sorry, but no, they did this so they can continue making movies with the new characters for many many more years, until every possible income has been lost from Star Wars. They killed them off so that they could get rid of the spirit of Star Wars, a huge middle finger to the long-time fans. I also didn't mention the stupid attempts of humor and one-liners thrown in. A mother joke in a Star Wars movie? You can't be serious. This movie is beautifully shot, has great music, etc. This can be expected because it is a Star Wars movie, created with millions of dollars. I do not like what they have done with this movie in pretty much every way besides that. Hell, they didn't even answer why Rey is so good at everything. Why can she fly the Millennium Falcon? Who knows. Why can she speak so many languages? I dunno. Why can she beat Kylo and Luke in fights? Beats me. And they didn't bother to answer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

After this, I will NOT be giving my money to LucasFilm as long as Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson are employed there.

There wasn't much point to Snoke... Ren is not threatening, Rey bested him in the first one easily.<br/><br/>The humour is misplaced, when there's some good tension it's immediately ruined by wannabe 'Marvelesque' humour, it lacks any class, finesse or flow.<br/><br/>The two movies attempt to throw in nostalgic moments to drum up those old feelings. I remember actually loving the start of the first movie, then once it settles down and Disney's ticket-selling ploys come to light, it just turned me off, the exact same happens here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

REALLY disappointed. A lot of it was the treatment of Luke's character, which (even though I'd been prepared) felt like an assassination of spirit. A lot of it had to do with side plots like the casino arc which dragged, and didn't advance the story (however much I loved rose and continue to love Finn). There were plot holes that made me screw up my face in the theater and mutter, that doesn't make sense. The way it leaned into prequel levels of ridiculousness in the over the top battle sequences all felt hollow. That was the biggest disappointment for me. I think there are ways the story could have leapt to a new generation with new struggles without selling the triumphs of the previous generation as meaningless. which is what this new movie has now done, and looks set to continue to do. The new movies have wiped away all the victories of the original trilogy and returned us to exactly the same balance of power that existed when we first met Luke and Han and Leia, which makes not just this film unwatchable, but every film that became before unwatchable as well.<br/><br/>I expected to leave the theater either ecstatic, or furious. Instead I just felt sad and empty and uninterested in seeing any other new star wars films in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

IMHO this is an incredibly bad move regarding the marketing of the movie, what the studio should focus on should only be on its fan base, anything other motivations should be kept at a minimum, yet we have all these social justice stuff that the old fan base cannot care less about. What's more is that the directors even said in interviews that they do not care about their fans, compare this with infinity wars and you can clearly see the difference between the attitudes of the leaders of the studios.<br/>Two points goes to visual effects, its a 200 million dollar budget film after-all.<br/>Would not go to see any new movies from the studio until they realize which is more important: fans or politics</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I have really many things to say about. Star Wars: The Last Jedi was the second best Star Wars film. However, I will start with two major problems of this film. First, Rose was not very successful character. She is the worst Star Wars character with Zaza Binks, and it ruined a bit of basic settings of Star Wars. I think almost everyone will agree to those two things, but this film was so spectacular because of these following reasons. First, it gave a huge breath to new characters. While The Force Awakens made huge impression of old characters and didn't really give actual focus to new characters, The Last Jedi really made them really impressive. Kylo Ren was like a nerd villain at the first time who just didn't like his father, but it all makes sense now and why he keeps saying 'Let Everything Die' and tries to keep convince Rey. Rey really grew because of Luke but also she finally understood what hope meant. It's also interesting to remember a quote in The Last Jedi from Leia, 'Hope is like the sun. If you only believe it when you see it you'll never make it through the night.' It forms sort of confrontation structure between Kylo Ren and Rey. Kylo Ren is the one who completely lost the hope and tries to rebuild the world and REy is the one who lost hope once and betrayed by Luke, but managed to learn hope and got the strength to lead the rebellion. Secondly, Luke was amazing. Original Star Wars was a story of Darth Vader and Luke, and Star Wars 8 was a story of Luke Skywalker. People say that this is not real Luke, but I think this is exact Luke Skywalker. Everyone makes a mistake, even Luke Skywalker. Luke was actually the one who had pride and was self-confident, but sometimes too rash like fighting with Darth Vader without being prepared. Luke made a mistake and suffered a lot. When Luke met Rey, he finally saw a real hope and acted something out. His force was beyond everyone and I was satisfied with the action even though he wasn't there. He teased Kylo Ren completely. Also Mark Hamill had done really amazing job acting and I got a goosebumps from it.<br/>Third one is convention and cliche. people might think that this is not a pro, but I think it is. This film completely broke convention and cliche just like The Empire Strikes Back did. Finally, The ending part was so good. I think it was good as Inception and The Dark Knight which I gave 10. The two suns are from Ep 4, especially binary sunset scene. I think the meaning of the scene is also significant. A little sun was bright once and it was going down which means Luke himself who made a sacrifice, and then a bigger sun rised which is Rey who inherated the role of Luke Skywalker and will become 'the new hope'.<br/>Also I wanted to mention John Willaim's amazing score. I think it's good as original scores. I really like REy's theme and march of resistance. Thus, I really enjoyed this film and got goosebumps like million times. This is the first film that I watched three times in theater 'in IMAX'.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I had hope after the Force Awakens, but this film seemed to intentionally spit in the face of series fans or really any cinema-goer with any amount of critical thinking, as the plot is meandering and ultimately pointless. The main theme of the film was about how the past needs to die and other hamfisted messages daisy chained together to slap viewers in the face with 'this aint yo daddy's star wars'-type schlock. Also Luke Skywalker had his character completely assassinated in such 180-degree ways that can not be explained as 'he got old' or 'he made a mistake and now feels super guilty about stuff'. I hated this film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

On the whole, however, the characters are unlikable caricatures with sloppy dialog. The story itself is a convoluted, meandering mess with nearly a third of the screen-time being utterly pointless. All the loose ends of the previous movie are either ignored or bluntly stated to be pointless. "Mary Sue" Rei Mary Sue's her way through everything as she did in episode 7, leaving no tension or attachment to her boring, vacant character. Add a dash of clumsy political ideological allegory and you end up with two and half hours of my life I wish that I could have back.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8353710"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">As big fan of the Star Wars saga, who grew up watching the other two trilogies, I was very excited about this "new tone" that TLJ would bring to the galaxy.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson's Lopper was promising and JJ Abrams had already quite successfully created foundations for the next instalment of the saga. Characters have already been established and stakes have spiralled. A new, mysterious and exciting villain came to the stage, Kylo Ren was supposed to finish his training and Rey was supposed to start one of her own with the only surviving Jedi Master.<br/><br/>And the expression “supposed to” defines this movie. What plotlines have been established in TFA were almost immediately dropped in TLJ. There would be no harm in that but the way it was done did not do the characters justice. Without getting into too much detail Snoke feels complete pointless to the overall plot. Luke doesn’t even resemble the Luke we used to know and without any proper backstory there is no reason ROTJ Luke would do the things he had done here. Not to mention the slap-on-the-face joke. Comedy in this movie is altogether tasteless, tactless and completely immersion breaking to a degree it requires a separate section.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the mystery surrounding Rey’s parents has been just thrown out the window. And with all of this missing what are we left with? The Disney Jedi Cinderella (or DJC) is one of the worst major characters in SW that I have seen so far. Even Jar Jar, however annoying he can be, had a better story. Like with Rey, Kylo Ren’s, Finn’s and Poe’s characters have been totally wasted. Not to mention Maz Kanata’s cameo which looks like it was shoehorned in there. What are we left with? Holdo has a huge part to play but the conflict which arises do to the role of her character isn’t just pointless, it’s completely illogical. I won’t even mention Rose who is just a complete waste of Diversity/Inclusion and only Social Justice Warriors can be happy about her character. Not only is he poorly written, drives a 20 minute pointless plot line which ultimately has no impact on the story at all. Again, like many other things in TLJ, it feels like Disney is trying to reprogram our minds instead of producing a good movie.<br/><br/>Time to change the topic a bit and let’s talk about comedy/comic relief. TLJ tries to do what Marvel has been so proficient at. Deliver an exciting story, sometimes dark and serious, with little drops of humor which remind us that at the end of the day Iron Man is just a comic book hero. It not only provides relief but also creates a feeling that the Marvel movies are comic book adaptations and shouldn’t be taken too seriously. They are made for fun. Star Wars on the other hand, even though a bit of humor has always been there since the original trilogy, it never took centre stage and would never, I repeat NEVER, break immersion. To say the least and keep this text short the scene were Luke casually throws away the light sabre is nothing more than a slap on the face for the audience. Regardless if you are a fan of SW or not. With this we have arrived at the biggest issue I have with Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Its plot just doesn’t make sense. The conflict is only crated for conflict’s sake and doesn’t make any lasting impact on any of the characters. They all survive, besides Luke, but do we know what the state of the galaxy is? What has really happened to the Resistance, where are they at now? And what about the Jedi? All throughout the movie we are told that the old must day, Jedi have to end. And do they? Of course not because Ray saves the ancient texts even though Yoda in his little cameo destroys the tree and the books. So are the Jedi gone? Should there be a new way to follow the force? No, because in the end Ray saves the books? And Why? Judging by where the story goes it won’t even be explained in the final movie.<br/>So are there any good things about the movie? Yes there are. Visuals are stunning, fights are amazing but, the Space Opera feeling the previous movies had is completely gone. Fans have been left mistreated and I honestly don’t see any reason why new fans should appear. I walked around Smyth’s Toys in Ireland the other day and found almost none of the toys. And whichever were left had discounted prices less than a year after the movie was released. This just speaks volumes about how successful this movie has been.<br/><br/>And finally, as I am no critic, I think critics are wrong about this movie. Not because they aren’t fans but they completely miss the point exactly how this movie did. It is just a poor movie. Is it worse than The Attack of the Clones? Just ask the fans and you will see, hear and know what the answer is: It is just a poor movie, hollow shell which everyone will quickly either forget or want to forget.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

After leaving the theater though, the more I thought about what I'd just seen, the less I liked it. It has lots of problems.... it doesn't give depth to any characters. It goes on completely irrelevant story arcs. It intentionally goes out of its way to destroy the franchise's pas characters and almost seems like it's mocking audience members who are/were fond of them. It has cute cgi creatures, but they're totally random. I can't get behind kylo ren as a villian, but he's somehow better than the heroine of the story who is simply a complete blank through her first two movies now. And it's very clearly trying to force women and minorities into roles for no particular reason. .... and then the studio is going out and accusing people of being sexist and/or racist if they can't get behind the film? I assure you I'm not either. I'd probably even consider myself a feminist. And I certainly have no objections to women or minorities in films. But shoving them in just to have them in... I don't know exactly what to rate this movie. A 0 would be hyperbole, but a 0 is definitely what I want to rate the studio's approach to any criticism they've received. As far as the film itself goes, I can say without any hyperbole that it was pretty disappointing. And that's disappointing to someone who wasn't hyped for it and had no particular expectations. I waited weeks before getting around to seeing it, even. I think a 3 or 4 is probably fair. I'd give it a 3.5, but will round down to 3 based on how the studio responded to anyone who didn't enjoy their work. I don't think many/any people will actually read this, but I'd strongly encourage anyone who feels at all like me to not watch the next in theaters. Or, at least, to make sure to not watch it for the first few weeks. They won't change without box office punishment, and the idea of having starwars turned into a tent-pole graphics fest that sells out on name alone like transformers or something makes me very sad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Whatever you thought about the prequels, they were a product of love towards the Star Wars universe and its characters. As a result you actually cared about the story and the characters. You cheered for the great moments, you laughed for the funny moments, you cringed for the cringe-worthy moments, and you got angry about stupid characters taking up the screen time.<br/><br/>While watching "The Last Jedi" I felt... nothing. It was all so disconnected, the lack of passion in the direction and in the acting was so clearly visible. Nobody cared for this movie when it was being made. I have a feeling that a lot of actors in this movie, just like Mark Hamill, disagreed with the direction the movie took under Rian Johnson and they just went through the motions, like "good professionals" would.<br/><br/>The only likable characters are that no-nonsense First Order admiral that dies in the first 5 minutes of the movie, Poe Dameron and Finn. They are the only ones that have passion and make it look like they are willing to fight for something they believe in. For a movie that was supposed to be big on feminism that movie does not have a single likable down-to-earth female character. Rose Tico was supposed to be that character, but she was thoroughly butchered in direction. Which brings us the the biggest fault of this move: incompetent directing. There are a lot of arcs and scenes in this movie that on paper were epic and profound and were utterly ruined by Rian Jonhson and instead came out stupid, pathetic, laughable or annoying.<br/><br/>Poe growing as a leader - awesome on paper - ruined in execution. Vice-admiral Holdo - a gentle leader of great wisdom - ruined in execution: Mr. Johnson - there is a huge difference between projecting strength to keep everyone calm and behaving like you are too stoned to care. Finn willing to sacrifice himself and saved by Rose - awesome on paper - so completely and utterly ruined in execution. This scene would be so hyper-epic if Rose sacrificed herself "not out of hate but to save the things she loved" and then she would get the a funeral of a hero. Instead she ended up looking like a selfish you-know-what, willing to risk everybody's life to get what she wants for herself.<br/><br/>And so on and so forth. Every single thing in this move could be epic, instead it fizzled down to nothing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A lot of the characters that you would expect to have a major role from the first movie of the new trilogy werent really pushed in the main plot at all and the ones that were pushed were overshadowed by how shallow some of the minor plot points were showcased.

I'm taking the time to do this so that eventually Disney learn the only way they care - financially - that we Star Wars fans will not continue to blindly pay up for rubbish like this.  I didn't go to see this multiple times at the cinema or buy it on blu-ray, unlike The Force Awakens.  That's them down already about £40 on last time from me.  Ensuring we real users give this movie its correct score on Metacritic is very important so everybody should continue posting reviews - we're not paid up professional 'critics' who conveniently score massive commercial films like this ridiculously highly regardless of the reality.<br/><br/>Numerous other reviews point to the glaring plot holes all over this so I don't need to, but they are absurd to the point the film can't be taken seriously enough to review.  I was a fan of The Force Awakens, I gave it a 7/10.  Sure, it was far too plot derivative and obvious and didn't make nearly enough of some key characters, but is introduced a whole new beginning and some potentially interesting characters and storylines that had Star Wars fans discussing and buzzing with excitement for two years while we waited.  It did the job, it got us off and started with something potentially great.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Rhian Johnson, the director, has NO idea about character development, or crafting a coherent, well thought through storyline that is cohesive to the laws of the Star Wars universe.. doing so would have ensured there are no really glaring, stupid plot holes.  The Last Jedi has so many it can only have been put together by a fool who thinks that "not being obvious" is always the right approach.<br/><br/>Questioning Rey's heritage?  That's actually quite a good 'surprise' to not play up to fan theories, but to make it not necessarily some huge deal (without going into the plot).  But what about the capability of characters to survive absolute zero in space and fly around and come back from the dead?  Or Luke's appalling treatment after no role in the first movie as some bad tempered old hermit who has an evil side and shows no traits whatsoever of the wisdom of a Jedi Master - which he is.  Not to mention the end of movie decision.. "let the past die" or whatever BS phrase they used.  That for me was unforgiveable and why it gets a 1 not even a 2 or 3.<br/><br/>It's not clever, it didn't make for a good movie.  It made it a really, really bad.  Good movies have payback for time invested and give the audience what they want (in whatever capacity that might be) eventually - example being seeing Luke as the final unfold at the end of The Force Awakens.  All fans wanted Luke to have a central role in this movie - it wasn't 'clever' or 'bold' not doing so, it would be like a band going on and playing a couple of their minor hits then indulging themselves playing new songs to the audience all night who have come to hear their greatest hits.  That would piss off any audience, that's what Rhian did here. How about the poor, new characters crafted by JJ Abrams?  They also got scant development in this movie.  Rey's character development stopped as she continued her apparent ability to use the most advanced Force powers with zero training in almost no time whatsoever (remember this movie followed straight on from the last).<br/><br/>Poe? Pointless, mutinous and comes across as "the aggressive little hot headed man" rather than the all action hero he was of the first movie.  Then there's a whole raft of really bad side plots and characters.  It's a shame to say that Finn now seems completely pointless too as a character.<br/><br/>In short, whereas I left The Force Awakens really curious for more and wanting to see what happened with all these characters.  Now I'm just like Mark Hamill - I don't care anymore beyond writing this.  While Star Wars is in the hands of those pursuing making current socio-political statements within a sci-fi world, these aren't movies I will be going to see anymore.  Starting with Solo - I'll check it out on blu-ray perhaps, if somebody else I know picks up a copy.  I won't be giving Disney a dime or introducing my kids to anything but the originals until they get the message and fire Kennedy and remove this horrific idea of Johnson doing an entire trilogy more of Star Wars films.<br/><br/>Hit them where it matters fans - at the box office with the future movies.  Help us fans, you're our only hope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

While the Force Awakens was by no means a great movie, it did set up some interesting plot and backstory questions moving forward. Then this movie came along and completely destroyed any hope this new trilogy had. It ruined the backstory questions surrounding both Rey and Snoke, though I can't say how or why without spoiling the movie. The Last Jedi succumbed to every bad trend developing in modern movies. Painfully awkward nonchalant humor? The Last Jedi has it. A useless story arc with a social justice message? The Last Jedi has it. While Daisy Ridley once again does a fine job in her role, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and just about everyone else deliver subpar performances. Neither Mark Hamill nor Carrie Fisher are anything to be amazed by in this movie, though they aren't as bad as some of their co-stars. The plot starts where the Force Awakens ended, which was in a decent place, and completely destroys everything about it. Story-wise I seriously don't know what they're going to do with the final episode. The writing seemed so unbelievably lazy that it could be considered borderline disrespectful. There were scenes that made me die a little inside at how either badly written or poorly executed they were, including a space scene in which something so unbelievably cringe-worthy and ridiculous happens that you want to get up and walk out of the movie (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). The worst part to me is the fact that these movies aren't done like Star Wars movies anymore. The writers and directors seem to have no respect or care for the history of the saga and what its many elements mean. The way the characters use the force, pilot ships, and just generally act feels less and less like Star Wars every time one of these movies comes out. I would NOT recommend this film to anyone who values their money and time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The jokes were funny (altough they were a bit too numerous), it felt more like Star Wars than TFA and I liked the little details which saluted the original trilogy.<br/>I also admit I turned my brain off completely during that movie for reasons I still didnt discover.<br/><br/>After I saw the first critical review of it on Youtube I was going: "Oh. Oh... Ohhhhh... OHHHHH! OMFG!!!11eleven". This movie seriously makes no sense at all in the Star Wars universe. I thought they messed up the Star Trek universe so much that Roddenberry rotated in his grave so much that he flew to the gamma quadrant, and TFA was bad enough, as if I was watching a parody of Episode 4, but this movie destroyed Star Wars that much, that it made me being disgusted of myself because I liked it at first. Well, not liked it, but at least I found it entertaining. After I whipped myself as punishment, I watched more critical reviews and found even more unbelievable stuff I didnt notice. So I whipped myself some more.<br/>Then I found out Abrams is doing the next movie again and I wanted to drown myself in the toilet, but thankfully my dog drank it dry before.<br/>But still, I was entertained at first, and so I will be fair and give it a 3... point 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This will be the first. The acting is poor as usual, it feels like it was written by a committee of low end writers trying to imitate Lucas and after about the first 45 minutes I was waiting for the fart jokes as the writing was on that level. I can just assume that every paid critic is well paid by Disney to give an 85 average score. Much like the slightly better episode 7, this was just written as a bad fanfic almost entirely mimicking ep5 as ep7 mimicked ep4. Not helping anything the main cast have no charisma and virtually no acting ability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And the more people have been trying to convince me this movie was just beyond my understanding as the reason I don't like it, it has pushed me further.  Rian Johnson, nothing against him personally, but his resume is brief enough to include here:  "Brick", "The Brothers Bloom", "Looper", and directed three Breaking Bad episodes.  That's not enough for me to just assume I don't understand his genius.  Plus, his decision to methodically go the unexpected route with each of his plot points just didn't work out for me.<br/><br/>We are severely lacking in antagonists now.  Rian killed off Snoke in a very anti-climatic way, which isn't bad by itself, but it left the FO hollow, with no cool Storm Trooper variants or characters, and no real officers.  Hux was wasted in this film, and no one has come close to convincing me otherwise.  Phasma was wasted, don't think many people think otherwise. I could go on and on, but I will at least say that there are several parts in this movie that were forced in to mold a storyline from.  I've watched this film a few times to see if my opinions would change, but those stick out sharper and sharper with each viewing.  I'll stop there and implore everyone to make up their own opinions on this film.  But if you are hear on Metacritic, perhaps gauging other's opinions, then this is mine.  A 5 out of 10, which sounds even crazier considering how passionate some people are about the greatness of this film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Meanwhile the Jedi hero goes to visit the old Jedi hermit to train under him but he's initially reluctant... just like Episode V. Some of the heroes seek out a gambler archetype to help them but he ends up betraying them... just like Episode V.<br/><br/>They have a battle on a white planet in a trench with speeders vs Imperial walkers... just like Episode V. A group of heroes sneak aboard the main enemy base in enemy uniforms to power down something keeping them from escaping... just like Episode IV. The Jedi hero is brought by the Sith apprentice to his master and the hero is about to be killed when the apprentice kills the master... just like Episode VI.<br/><br/>ALL of the plot is ripped right from the original trilogy except the animal rescue scene in Canto Bight... which people who liked the movie didn't even care for. And then the movie destroys the character of Luke "I can't kill my own father" Skywalker who prepares to murder his nephew in his sleep like a psychopath. Tell me, if someone told you they held an axe above the their nephew while he slept and at the last second decided not to slay him, what would you think of that person?<br/><br/>The main villain is a whiny little brat who has been bested by the untrained, inexperienced hero twice. How is that a credible threat? Think of your favorite villains; Voldemort or Darth Vader for example. They are good villains because they are scary. Because they seem unstoppable. It makes you want to watch more because you want to see how the hero can rise up enough to defeat them. But you don't even remotely have that in TLJ.<br/><br/>I could go on about the dozens (yes, literally) of plot holes, lack of interesting characters, extreme female superiority, and more that contribute to this movie being a steaming pile of dog crap, but there are more than 3,000 other metacritic reviews that go over that already.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson: "Who's Luke Skywalker, and how do things work in space? Never mind, I'll just wing it."</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It had a terrible plot, childish characters and a "Mary Sue" protagonist - And don't even tell me she is not one, because years on the desert would make her only good at fighting and extremely greed. I hope that this 3rd trilogy or at least from this second movie on, to suffer a reboot. And I can say that I will not be getting to the theaters to watch episode IX nor anything else until things significantly changes at disney. Hey disney! do not spend your precious money on episode IX, reboot episode VIII !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I grew up with these films in the 1970's, lived through the dire episodes 1-3, and thankfully with LTJ Star Wars has found its feet and is finding its OWN voice rather than clinging to a stodgy restrictive past.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is front and centre "death and rebirth" (the dark and the light) and I think it did a very good job, whilst I can TOTALLY understand why the haters are hating on it, I think they are missing the WHOLE POINT of the story, it's OK for people we idolised to have flaws and make mistakes, you grow and you learn from them. Thankfully this time they at least gave Kylo Ren a bit more depth than "moody teenager", there was real loss for the Rebellion in this, thank goodness, rather than the fake faux angst in previous films. It took Star Wars in new directions rather than relying on tired old formulas, the plans didn't always work, the outcomes weren't always predictable. I'm GLAD they didn't play it safe with the information on Rey's parents and didn't go the obvious and safe route.<br/>The haters are hating because the film didn't go where they wanted it to go, but that's exactly why I absolutely LOVED IT. It was fresh and didn't try to be precious and safe, I in no way think it was giving the middle finger to the franchise that had gone before it (but can understand why some might think so), I think it was trying to define its own identity, which I think it did admirably. Let's just hope that with Abrams back at the helm for the next one he doesn't get scared and just give us an uninspired safe regurgitation of films that are over 40 years old.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A hollow experience without substance or emotional engagement. I was lukewarm after the first viewing but after watching it again recently I can confirm that the film is less than average and I will not be watching it again. This one is poorly written, bland,and without soul.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rehashed action scenes that make you think you've seen them before somewhere such as the original trilogy, and just a disorienting 2.5 hour mess of a movie that does little else besides assasinate characters you care about and shove down your throat characters that you don't.<br/><br/>John Williams kills it as usual, and the movie looks great but the story is so bad you can't help but feel that it is truly meant to just be insulting to the fanbase on purpose.<br/><br/>I can no longer support anything Rian Johnson directs from here on out. Easily the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I had a lot of problems with Episode 7 (plot holes mostly) but I generally enjoyed it in theatres. I hate this movie, I will never watch it again. This movie does nothing else for me besides make me hate it more the more I think about it.<br/><br/>Skip this movie Star Wars fans.

Extremely annoying is also the raving review by the press. Seriously?
