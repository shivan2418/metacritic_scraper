Most of the performances felt like the characters were just going through the motions.  The juvenile and inappropriately timed attempts at humor broke my immersion from the start, and continued to throughout. The whole enterprise was a complete slog for me to sit through. By the time the movie got to what should have been some cool scenes, I was so checked out that I didn't care or feel anything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The only two characters that were likeable at all was Rose Tico and Poe Dameron.  There was a LOT of emphasis on Poe in this movie and they fleshed out his character - young, brash, always trying to be the hero and sometimes getting it but sometimes not.  You get to see him in a *lot* of starfighting which makes for great action sequences.<br/><br/>Rose's character felt way more down to earth than Rey.  Plucky engineer turned heroine.<br/><br/>Feels like this movie should've been about 30-45 minutes longer - the subplots really did not feel that well meshed together at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As a movie in general, it is slow and just too long.  I didn't care about any characters.  As a Star Wars movie it lacks the fun and adventure I enjoy.<br/>The oddest thing were the attempts at comic relief.  They were all so poorly timed and not funny that they really detracted from any drama that may have built up.  It reminded me of when Leslie Nielsen would come into the cockpit when the plane was crashing in Airplane but that was funny and appropriate. Don't worry about spoilers because NOTHING interesting happens.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I feel like the creators really didn't have a good grasp on the characters. They took one of the most iconic characters and turned him into a coward that would kill someone in their sleep instead of confronting them in open battle. They kept luke in hiding instead of again confronting the first sith/evil that arose after he beat the emperor. I feel alot of outlets are just carrying the water for this movie. Superman Leia? Really? Come on guys. I think many actually didnt like it but arw afraid to say it. Our hero characters of theart 40 years were just openly trashed and replaced with Mary she's. Even directly spoke to us and said let the past die. The new characters aren't deep enough and since no one created any backstory for most of the characters they can't be. Snoke could have been the most notorious villian in SW history yet, he was killed without even dipping toe into it. Even if a new franchise is created to explain it, the damage was done to this story. Basically this is a movie where everything that was created before it is discarded and made mute and pointless. So many wasted opportunities and mistreated characters. Thanks again hollywood.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

That's why movies like Rogue One or The Force Awakens works consistently well with the mainstream and fans equally. The characters do shine to an extent alongside copious amount of twists and moments, but leaves room for demanding more on some of them (Finn and Poe) as seemingly wasted potentials. A precedent for fan hatred and it is explanatory. The pacing had its issues during the first act and felt dragging towards the last act which did take me out of the movie, warranting a shorter feature without skipping the pivotal and titular segments in it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It has always been a part of my life, through sickness, health, sunshine and rain. I was diagnosed when I was young with a serious personality disorder. I saw councilor after councilor and eventually nothing helped except sitting down and watching my favorite movies (and RPG games but that's not why I'm here). I loved the Force Awakens and Rogue One, I even didn't mind the prequel trilogy, OK granted I and II weren't that good but I enjoyed Return of the Sith and I at least wanted to know what happened next in I and II. My point being there hasn't been a single Star Wars film that I have truly disliked, if anything I may well owe to it my life. No exaggeration.<br/><br/>With this in mind I do not want to speak negatively of a franchise that means so much to me  BUT: (and this is a big but, and I cannot lie) The Last Jedi is, IN MY OPINION, a bad film. Hell it may even be a bad film objectively. I'll start with the pacing issues; this is how the last Jedi plays out, "hey you like the first scene from a New Hope when the star destroyer's chasing the Tantive IV? Yes? Of course you do its a great scene! How would you like that scene to run for THE ENTIRE MOVIE? Not so much? Oh, tough your getting it anyway and we'll throw in random bits of Empire as well but we'll still say it breaks new boundaries. Also while this, seemingly decade-long, Space chase is going on we'll cram in the rest of the movie." It was a mess and no amount of space combat, breathtaking as it was, was going to distract me from it. I mentioned the "bits of Empire" there were many moments when I found comparisons. I don't, initially, have a problem with similarities, I loved TFA, but when every reviewer is saying its innovative and fresh I feel ripped off. Not so much by Disney on this aspect but by the journalists that misled me. Thank God for user scores. One more thing about the truly awful, giant chase scene; its a small thing but there's a moment when one of the nameless Imperial generals says "they are lighter and faster than us" um... they are in Space, weight's not an issue.<br/><br/>It wasn't all bad of course. There were elements that were great, John Boyega and Daisy Ridley were fantastic and actually gave me a sense of national pride (I'm British). Kelly Marie Tran and Benicio DelToro were very good too. A breath of fresh air. It looked great, the fight scenes were ace and what it got right, it nailed. It's a shame to see Rian Johnson fail as I really enjoy his previous work (Looper was so good). "So, nameless, gender-less internet user of unknown sexual identity, it doesn't sound all that bad why such a low score?" I hear you ask, well if your still with me I'll explain in the next paragraph.<br/><br/>The worst and frankly most unforgivable thing about the last Jedi, for me, was the handling of the late, great Carrie Fisher. As a life-long advocate of mental health awareness she was an inspiration to me for more reasons than just being Leia. I don't care who's "creative decision" it was to essentially ignore the fact that an international icon has passed away, the fact is it genuinely upset me. I tried to watch it for the second time yesterday and walked out as soon as they destroyed the bridge and she floated off with all the dignity of a condom in a river. 15 minutes and I was done. It was a huge kick in the teeth. I could have forgiven the unexplained, survive in spaceness of the initial "death" scene if they'd had the decency and the guts to give her a proper send off later in the film. They had several perfect opportunities, not least of all when the rebel cruiser hyperdrived through the other imperial ship. That was potentially the big redeemer. It was a great scene. Instead of using that other general (who was so forgettable I can't remember her name) why on Earth (or Alderaan) didn't they let the aging Princess make one final, valiant sacrifice to save what she loves? I would have cried like a baby right there in the cinema for all the right reasons instead of quietly crying to myself after being let down so hard. This would of also made that forgettable rebel general lady much more of an interesting character going forward. Speaking of going forward, as Disney have stated (loudly) there will be no CGI Leia, the only alternative is to just write her out like she's nothing. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!<br/><br/>So there it is, this is my first review anywhere so I'm sorry if it was long but I had to get this out of my head. To summarize; Star Wars the Last Jedi had infinite potential after TFA but it was very much let down by terrible pacing and incredibly insensitive handling of a subject that's very important to a lot of people. There were some gaping plot holes on top, meaning I've lost all interest in IX as well. Such a shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But........ is overwelming inconsistent, messy and has really badly motivated storylines. Even if they would have skipped the wole codebreaker search it's still a movie that doesn't have a good pace. For me the movie started failing when Leia suddenly resurrected as superman from the dead with her Force. WTF!  Also these strange long distance force phone calls between Ray and Kylo where to easy; there is no limitation, tension or magic when this happens. In the old movies, Luke had to be at least near Father to sense him, they could not talk like a phone call, only maybe one word orso. This was more indirect, more limited and therefore with more imagination of us a the viewer. A good movie I think should give the hero a  limitation to struggle with.  Let them deal with maybe two problems at once. Or when someones solve one problem, a new problem automatically comes forth of that. And show the a little more struggle/effect of a character, with sweat, a small silence, hesitation, an inner battle. Come closer to the eyes like a Spielberg shot. Why not show Luke battling internally with going bad if he is so scared of Ray, why not let Luke heavily attack her in his blindness. This would have got me on my seat immedaitly. Then Rey could be maybe be the one who turns Luke to good again.  I also agree with the not so adventurous retro aspect of the movie, I could have accepted that; Force Awakens was also a remash, but i loved it in many more ways compaired to this one.<br/>How is it possible that is from the same guy who made  Looper! I don't know if his new trilogy will be ok at all.... Man what a major bummer indeed!  And how can JJ fix this stuff?

What has started really promising with TFA has been crushed completely within 152 min. Not just TFA was thrown into the garbage bin, but also the entire Star Wars legacy... What really makes me angry is that despite of the prequels, which weren't surely a highlight, it seems Rian Johnson did this with full intention. When George Lucas did the prequels he didn't knew better, but he tried as best a possible. Sure he failed in the end, but I cannot blame someone that really gave his best. Rian and surely Disney instead pissed on everything that has been created before. Just remember this magic moment at the end of TFA, when Ray meets Luke for the first time. If you have seen TLJ already you know what Mr. Johnson did with this wonderful scene ... Absolutely no respect for the work J.J. did with TFA. Also Rian continues to hype the question about Ray's parents in one scene of TLJ to the max. just to give the most unsatisfying answer later on. I could continue how Rian treated the Character of Luke, but I think it's all been said. For me personally the worst and disrespectful Star Wars ever made and the worst Movie experience so far. A complete letdown ... Please help us Mr. Abrams you are our only hope !!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

What an achievement!<br/><br/>There are no satisfying conclusions to anything. Every question you had is swept aside. Who's Snoke? Who cares say Disney. Who are Rey's parents? Who cares What happened to Phasma after giving up the death star codes to Finn, resulting in its destruction? Who cares. How did Kylo escape the death star? Who cares.<br/><br/>The chase sequence is mind-bendingly dim. You're told a bunch of nonsense 'we must do... because..." lines by characters to wedge something totally nonsensical into something representing a plausible situation.<br/><br/>Spoiler of the most major plot hole below<br/><br/>So they're running out of fuel and about to get blatted by Snoke's star destroyer. In order to escape they decide to hack the star destroyer. In order to do this Finn travels to a casino on a distant planet to find a hacker. Wait? Doesn't that mean they have a way of escaping? AAAAAGGGHHH! Why is it all so stupid! Hardly anything makes sense under even the most minimal of scrutiny. Did you think we wouldn't notice the idiocy Disney?<br/><br/>The nail in the coffin for this film was turning our beloved Luke into a doosh. All that magic and hope at the end of ROTJ. Dead.<br/><br/>We keep being told about a story about Luke and the Knights of Ren - A much more interesting story than the one we're watching. How about making that film? At least it might make me believe Luke could become such a spanner. Luke's ending was sad, and not in a good way. It felt pointless. This could have been made a million times better with a few very simple changes.<br/><br/>The more I think about The Plot-hole Awakens, the worse it gets. Oh, and no, it's not funny despite thinking it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But this is a STAR WARS saga film. You have a reputation and history to live up to. You have dedicated hardcore fans, fans like no other franchise has ever seen. You betrayed us all. It's obvious you care more about copying Guardians of the Galaxy and cloning the Avengers, which are okay things by themselves but do not even come close to the longevity, fanaticism, and dedication that Star Wars has. If you wanted to start a new fanbase that's enamored with cheap comedy, horrible storytelling, and breaking every known boundary of things the bind the films together (the Force, space, light-speed, and the legacy of one main character, to name a few) while stealing story components from previously successful films in the franchise.... congrats. You lost us all. We were the ones that in-between trilogies bought comics, books, action figures, watched animated tv series -- and even sat through 2 1/2 mediocre films before we saw the payoff that Revenge that the Sith gave us. We won't do it this time. Enough is enough. Someday Episode 7-8-9 will be re-written and honor restored to the characters we all love, and new, more-dimensional characters will be written to carry on their legacy. Until then, good luck with Episode IX. I won't be there, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who will be moving on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Where Luke Skywalker fight bug in cave, to save generic imperial cannon fodder who has Nazi's SS personality.<br/><br/>Joke aside, now let go to the movie.<br/><br/>Movie?..... dammit, I can't remember anything about the movie. All I remember is how everything appear in this movie will be used to lure kid to gambling more and more. The movie seem like product placement at its finest without caring a single thing about Star War and what Star War is. And yeah, the whole plot can be sum into... "go out and buy these toys for your kid". That's how forgetful the movie is.<br/>The other way to summarized the movie plot is... Superficial plot of original trilogy reskin.<br/><br/>This movie give me more horror and fear than SAW in term of how it will turn the next generation of Star War fan into gambling addict.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Mark Hamill deserves an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Luke, such a heavy performance that expertly conveys the loss and hopelessness that Luke feels. Ridley, Boyega and Isaac were great once again with another stand-out being Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, furthering a character that is quickly overtaking Darth Vader as the best Star Wars villain.<br/>However there are flaws present particularly with the casino sequence feeling out of place and a few narrative hiccups here and there but i'm willing to look past them as the challenging and risky feel of this movie threw me completely off guard and was exactly what this saga needed 40 years after the original.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This isn't a star wars film, Luke isn't a master jedi, look at Yoda, look at Obi-Wan how they teach to their padawans and look Luke now. Look what were the laser sword battle in starwars (Obi-wan and Quai gon jin vs Darth Maul, Anakin and Obi-wan vs Doku, Luke vs Darth Vader...) and now Luke vs Kylo looks like a street fight. And the humor, this horrible humor for star wars, it will be ok for Guardians of the Galaxy but here... no words, Finn a terrible character the history with Rose has no relevance inside the star wars universe and in the film has a lot of scenes, when Rose saves Finn with the spider **** and more **** Leia flying for the space like superman, using a space ship at light's speet to split a destroyer (why use blaster cannons? use ships) but it's not the worst this film has lost completley the star wars essence...there is not more hope for star wars fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The dialogue is clunky, the humour never lands and the heroes feel as though they are ludicrously invincible (Mary Poppins in space comes to mind in one of the early examples of this). The 'answers' to all the questions posed in Force Awakens arive dead on impact, suggesting that Disney/Lucasfilm had no idea what the answers were anyway when they thought them up. I liked Force Awakens and Rogue One, I went to see them more than once in the cinema and have bought them on download since. This, however, feels like a step in a wrong, missguided direction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Force Awakens left everything at a great point and bridge to this movie and they seemed to dropped the ball on everything that was expected of it. They tried to avoid what was obvious to make it unexpected they threw away all the chances to deliver on what should have been great moments. Good news is JJ will be back for part 3 and I think they knew this was going to be a let down for most fans. The director shouldn't be expecting his next 3 films to be made I don't think this will be highly regarded by fans of Star Wars. Out of 100 great moments they could have had they had about 5 or 6?

What the Last Jedi does</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I feel almost compelled to jump into this dumpster fire of a fan reaction to throw in my 2 cents as to why I feel this is one of the best Star Wars movies that has been released to date.<br/><br/>Got your attention?  Good.<br/><br/>What the Last Jedi does better than any other Star Wars movie is completely rip off the cliche clothing and step forward into undiscovered territory by making this a story about a collective, instead of a story about a few individuals putting the galaxy on their backs.  The First Order is not about one old evil man with ridiculous powers.  It is not about 1 apprentice hell bent on world destruction.  It is not about one girl with extraordinary powers.  It is not about one General who never makes a mistake.  It is not about a heroic pilot who can do no wrong and every plan works without fail.  This is how Star Wars has been throughout its history.  Have a galactic problem?  Sure, let the Jedi handle it.  Hell the Old Republic was all about letting the Jedi " keep the peace " throughout the galaxy with their immense strength.  Anyway, this movie sheds all that.  Poe is a fantastic pilot who could perhaps on his own take out a Star Destroyer, but he makes failed choices and lacks true leadership.  As Leia says, he is a Hero, but not a Leader.  His actions destroyed the bombing fleet, got dozens of people killed and in the end didn't do much but destroy a Dreadnaught, something the First Order has more of and will simply make more of.  So in the end, that action that cost lives, did nothing.  Finn is not just a super soldier who's every plan comes to fruition without fail or consequence.  His idea to pack up his things and try to jettison an escape pod, a simple enough task, is foiled when Rose catches him and tasers him in the throat.  Then when they try to put together the perfect plan to best the First Order and save the Fleet, it fails because they trusted a man only interested in money, on nothing but faith that he wouldn't stab them in the back.  Plan failed.<br/><br/>Snoke is not just Palpatine 2.0 as fans wanted him to be.  He wasn't some evil man in a chair whos every ambition becomes reality and every whim comes to fruition.  He trusted his legacy into a little kid who was already emotionally troubled by his past.  Than this old man ridicules his apprentice throughout the movie expected no retaliation.  His own arrogance pushed him to believe his vision of the future so solidly that their was no alternative, like the saber being drawn and struck through was not Rey's body but his own.  He could not see a future where his apprentice turned on him and killed him for his own ambitions.  As Snoke says, " I cannot be defeated, I cannot be killed ".  He was an arrogant old man, who deserved what he got.<br/><br/>Luke Skywalker is not the legendary grandmaster jedi that we all wanted him to be.  He was a broken soldier with a heavy heart and mind due to his own failures in attempting to train family and others.  He did not have the knowledge in all aspects of the force to stop his students from being tempted by and turned toward the Dark Side.  How does one handle such a thing?  He isn't the be all end all soldier who would return to the fight and stop all from happening.  He couldn't be.  What sort of Galaxy would be left behind if they all looked toward one person to do it all for them?<br/><br/>That is what I love about this film.  It works toward building a collection of characters and ideals that when put together form a solid foundation, not built on a single hope, but a group effort and desire to be better.  That is the idea of this film, and one that is absolutely nailed from start to finish.  So many twists, so many nostalgic moments.  The acting is much improved from TFA, the battles are much improved.  Really this is Star Wars grown up and bursting out of its shell of endless Cliches.  I love the new direction, and cant wait to see how this Saga ends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I admit the movie has its flaws, pretty big ones at that. Finn and Rose's little adventure was just throwaway nonsense. Rose is a very dull and cliched character. The heroes introduced in force awakens didn't get as much screen time. The new resistance leader with the purple hair wasn't very interesting. It also has a slow start and the overall story about trying to escape from imperial ships was a bit pointless. Still, despite all of those criticisms I had a really great time watching it. There really are some fantastic moments and I appreciate the fact that this movie was clearly made for the fans. Ray and Kylo Ren in particular pulled me in. It didn't quite meet my expectations and struggled with pacing but overall it's a great movie and i'm excited to watch it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The last jedi isn't a perfect movie and it's mostly disney's fault or do you really think that looper's director could ever want an out of the blue joke scene? come one everybody, Star Wars is as good as a franchise as mc donalds. Despite all of this I really enjoyed how jj abrams' effort to give us a cameo saga went south, mostly thanks to new grounds breaking like killing snoke in few seconds. it's a good star wars movie mostly beacause of the good use the director makes of sw universe itself giving us something fresh, nothing like the force awakens</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Are you serious?<br/><br/>I can see Disney's devilish smile while taking money from this enormously overestimated series, turned into a bland soap-opera without any philosophy and emotional connections. It's a shame that Princess Leia got such messy and lukewarm goodbye which "The Last Jedi" is. It seems that no one really cared about origins of force, just trying to get rid of all the old characters instead (while still making money mostly for having the actors from original trilogy). But the most irritating thing is that the new ground and all the new characters have nothing new to add or explain.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I was constantly on the edge of my seat because I was so invested in this world and its characters that I grew up with, it had nothing to do with good story writing. I had the same feeling for the Force Awakens, when I first saw it I thought it was the most amazing film of all time, it was a sequel to a movie I had been waiting for more than a decade. But after the initial buzz wore off and I had time to reflect, i thought it was a pretty average movie. The excitement of seeing the OT characters, environments, and props masked the movie's weaknesses. The same goes for The Last Jedi, quite frankly it just didn't feel like an official Star Wars film, it felt like a fan fiction.<br/><br/>For all the die hard OT fans, imagine if a good sequel trilogy was released shortly after the OT, i just cant fathom it resembling anything like the sequel movies we got (not in terms of production, but in terms of the overall direction of the story). I understand why Mark Hamill said he "fundamentally disagreed with everything about Luke Skywalker's character" in the Last Jedi. The optimistic Jedi who wouldn't give up on Darth Vader contemplated killing his nephew who hadn't even turned to the dark side yet?  In terms of the story and production, it didn't fit the setting and universe of Star Wars.<br/><br/>I think a lot of the high review scores are due to nostalgia, strong attachment to the characters and universe of Star Wars, and a burning need to have quality sequels to a great franchise. Take away the bias and wishful thinking and think carefully about this movie, you will realize how disappointing and average it really was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is probably the blandest Star Wars movie to date, including the prequels (though the prequels have other problems).  Even with The Force Awakens rehashing old ground, it still managed to establish the characters in interesting ways and lead us on some interesting plot lines with character progression, some decent acting and great cinematography.<br/><br/>But The Last Jedi had little of that.  Honestly, I found it to be a bit of a mess, with poor acting and direction (which is alarming because I think Disney has said they'll be giving this director his own Star Wars trilogy!).  The whole premise of the movie was kind of dumb and when I realized that's what the whole movie was going to be about, I was dumbfounded.  The plot is next to MEANINGLESS.  This movie goes no where!  Little story progression, even less character development.<br/><br/>The two new main characters have little of interest in their personalities and back story, and one does something monumentally stupid that would normally make no sense, but which is shoe-horned in by a crappy writer.  And I find Leia's literal force armor more ridiculous than all the plot holes in The Force Awakens.  Oh man that scene was bad (you'll know it when you see it!).<br/><br/>I was really disappointed in the Finn/Rose/BB8 plot line.  BB8 was charming in TFA, but here his antics are old and slightly ridiculous (guess that fits with the rest of the movie).  Again Phasma is sadly reduced to a minuscule role.  It's also laughably unfortunate that it takes them to an actual casino where all the greedy gather, considering EA's BattleFront II fiasco!  Sadly, they rely heavily on nostalgia again...it's way worse than TFA.  There are so many lines ripped straight from the original three movies.  And while they don't rehash The Empire Strikes Back the way TFA rehashed the original, it still gives off some uncomfortably similar vibes in the closing act.  Rogue One did nostalgia right without being shackled to the past films; obviously no lessons were learned.<br/><br/>The Porgs are an obvious marketing gimmick in an attempt to cash in on the baby Groot thing.  At least they did provide most of the good comedy in the movie.  Most of the other attempts at humor were cringey one-liners.<br/><br/>I simply didn't feel any tension in this movie, despite the peril the Resistance was in.  I didn't care about it or the characters.  It's like all the interesting arcs established in the first movie fell flat on their faces.  Luke/Rey were disappointing.  Kylo/Snoke were disappointing.  Finn/Poe bromance didn't happen.  Chewbacca was barely in the movie, and is sorely lacking for want of Han.<br/><br/>Oh man, I'm kind of crushed.  I had high hopes after TFA did a reasonably good job of setting things up and Rogue One was surprisingly good.  Now I just feel empty.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd rank the Star Wars movies as follows:<br/><br/>1) The Empire Strikes Back<br/>2) Rogue One<br/>3) A New Hope<br/>4) Return of the Jedi<br/>5) The Force Awakens<br/>6) Revenge of the Sith<br/>=====Big Gap Here=====<br/>7) The Phantom Menace<br/>8) Attack of the Clones<br/>9) The Last Jedi</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As result we have gotten one of the most exhilarating cinema experiences of the last decade. Nothing I expected to happen happened leaving me in awe, I have seen many viewers disliking this movie as result of it subverting their own head cannon. But too me and I am sure many the risks this movie took really heighten it above other star wars movies. While the plot is somewhat lacklustre, this movie instead focuses on the characters letting Rey, Kylo and Luke shine. Additionally what allows this movie to have a leg up on other star wars movies is the sense of urgency felt throughout the movie (Besides the Rose and Finn Subplot which is definitely the worst part about the movie) you are truly on the edge of your seat throughout the movie unsure about who will make it through to  episode 9. While there are some weak moments there are many amazing moments throughout that definitely outweighs the weak. I cant forget to mention how gorgeous this movie looks, one of the many highlights of the movie is that it is a visual masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The way they killed Luke though for no reason in such a stupid fashion means I am done with SW forever. KK & RJ can keep this trash its not SW its really bad fan faction. Sorry day for Star Wars killing the OT hero after he gave everything & the actor gave the best performance of his career to date.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Instead, it's a total mixed bag.  Some of it works great, and some of it is really cringe worthy / just bad.  You'd think with a playing time of 2:32, Rian Johnson could have fit in some character development.  Yeah, not so much.  Disney must be the master of the hype machine bc an 86 on metacritic is WAY to high for this movie.  Seriously, give me a break - it's a 60-65 at best.  Most of the action sequences are good, and Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley (Rey) and Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) give strong performances -- as does John Boyega (Finn).  The rest of the cast... disappointing.  I would go as far as to say that all of the new characters in this movie added ZERO to the quality (except for Benicio del Toro who has a fun but minor role).  And, worst of all for this reviewer, they couldn't help themselves but add new cute, fury creatures like they did in Episode 6 that add zero to the story line (Ewoks - *groan* - it sucked then and it's just as bad now).  I guess it's all about merchandising, right Disney?  I would say that there really are only 3 good Star Wars movies: episodes 4, 5 and 7.  I don't want to watch this one again, and that's a really bad sign for a Star Wars fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Episode VIII, on the other hand, just left me bored and frustrated. It had totally useless scenes, nonexistent character development, and a predictable story arc that adds nothing to Episode VII and in fact, leaves you wondering: "Just...why?" The acting and handful of memorable moments scattered in this film save the day, but I have the feeling that 'The Last Jedi' has Rian Johnson following down the path of the George Lucas prequels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Ever since Disney acquired Star Wars, they've ruined it in so many ways! Predictable from start to finish, terrible cgi on certain characters, completely laughable moments and dialogue, complete disrespect towards classic characters, the list goes on and on! In regards to this film, in addition to what I mentioned above, I walked out of this one feeling nothing, and with the exception of one or two genuinely cool moments, this film was just like 'The Force Awakens' and 'Rogue One', absurd and a waste of time. I don't care how many people I'm about to piss off by saying this, but even the prequel trilogy tried harder and is better than these in my opinion!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Look not further! Watch... as an Asian woman smashes the glass ceiling while completing the task her male counterpart could not, pushing a giant red button on a remote keypad. Not BIG enough SJW propaganda for you? Watch... as the Asian woman's sister goes from pipe fixer to an expert in the metaphysics of hyper-space travel. But that's not all, watch said sister suddenly become an expert rider of wild animals, point out social injustice on a planet that revolves around gambling and weapon sales, and save her dopey emasculated male at the last moment from certain death because he lacks the proper genitalia to preform a heroic act.<br/><br/>If that isn't groundbreaking enough, how about spending sometime aboard the rebel fleet. Where Admiral Ackabar plays the male privilege card and pays the ultimate price... death. But fear not friends, there is a strong woman waiting in the wings, ready to lead and curtail alpha male Poe, whose male brain is only capable of recklessness without strong female leadership. Watch... as Poe leads the film down a pointless side story only to be emasculated from afar while watching a strong woman, who is flying a giant rebel ship completely by herself btw, teach alpha male Poe how self sacrifice and accountability really works.<br/><br/>After climaxing on the SJW propaganda, be sure to get your fill of corny jokes, Luke Skywalker drinking green tit juice, Luke's Marvel comic character debut with a shoulder dust off, Kylo failing miserably like every other male character in the film, and BB-8 deus machina the entire plot line that seems to have been written by a team of people who believe sexual orientation is a social construct.<br/><br/>I am giving it one point, because the oppressed black man actually does kill his white slave oppressor captain Phasma who happens to be female. Although this is conflicting, as it really is another SJW race card reference about Whitey keeping the black man down. Given that the character is female, I feel as though I need to give that a nod, as it could have been a straight white male.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Upset that their precious prequels and garbage Legends continuity has taken a back seat. They would expect the predictable outcome that Rey was a Kenobi/Skywalker/Solo which would have been fan-fiction style awfulness. They think JJ Abrams and Disney ruined the franchise but the box office and critical reception says otherwise. None of these "fans" want to face the fact that if Lucas took on the sequel trilogy, it would have had the same pitfalls, except with 33% more dementia.<br/><br/>No one cares what social media has to say about the franchise.

The saddest part of this is that it will make a ton of money, and they will do a sequel. The worst part about it is that the director was green lit for 3 other Star Wars movies. He needs to stop.

In fact this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, The only problem I had with it was the casino planet sequence. Also I believe all the 0-2 reviews left by fanboys are because Luke wasn't Yoda 2.0 and didn't do amazing flips and blow up spaceships with his mind smh... I feel sorry for anyone who didn't enjoy this movie but I have a hard time believing they honestly think this movie deserved a 0, 1 or 2 because they've obviously finished the movie and anything under a 3 isn't worth staying till the end for, another thought is this completely deviates from the original trilogy, you know the children's movie where a boy grows up and learns to swordfight with his pet robot and fuzzy animal friend. I can imagine in the 70s the original trilogy being considered a great kids movie but the last Jedi is a different beast entirely and will have you thinking on whole new levels as in not everything and everyone is completely good or evil. The conflict within Luke's mind is for lack of a better word realistic. I mean did some people expect this movie to be about Luke destroying armies with his mind and being some type of zen God? I mean think about what he has witnessed, maybe it would be better if the Jedi were dead? I hate it for the bad reviewers cause I wish that they saw what I did or at least enjoyed it in someway. All I can hope for is Disney listens to the less vocal majority of people who truly loved this film and I hope they stay the course</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Easily one of the best of the series.  The fanboy negativity is mainly rooted in the movie not meeting their theory expectations or them putting too much weight into the importance of secondary characters.  - For example, Snoke.  Why does anyone give a crap about this Palpatine clone?  He was one of the main issues of the original, IMO.  Just a typical overpowered CGI "evil" baddie.  No layers to him.  We've seen this trope in essentially every Super hero movie of the past decade.  I'm over it.  His backstory is irrelevant.  You nerds will no-doubt have the unnecessary blanks filled in with comicbooks.<br/><br/>- Got news for you - Kylo Ren is easily the most interesting/compelling movie villain we've had in a blockbuster since Ledger's Joker.  Try thinking of one better.  Closest you'll get is Loki.  Adam Driver's performance is outstanding.  If you look at what his side has accomplished in the past two movies - they are absolutely laying waste to the entire rebellion.  His chemistry with Rey is undeniable.  This series comes down to the lightside/darkside clash between these two conflicted characters.  It's working.<br/><br/>- I love Luke.  Those of you who have had expectations of Luke's post-movie career - no doubt rooted in endless hours spent reading since-uncanonized **** novels, countless extended universe comics, and several video games, did not appreciate how different this portrayal was.  Step back.  It makes sense with the story they are telling.  His role worked to push Rey/Kylo further.  It was faithful to his personality given what we know about Kylo's origin.  It was a wonderful ending, and he no-doubt will return as a force ghost later on.  There were incredible moments in this movie.  There were aspects that were certainly rough (Laura Dern's character in particular), that I suspect had a large part to do with Carrie Fisher's death throwing production a curve-ball.  The humor was on-point.  The action was on-point.  The emotional weight was on-point.  Overall, this was a phenomenally entertaining movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie pairs up our characters to great effect, and this is the best performance by Mark Hammill yet.  I found the big moments epic, the intimate moments involving, and the surprises were true doozies!  (So much so, that you really limit how many reviews you read for fear of massive spoilers.)  It is evident why Lucasfilm felt so confident in Rian Johnson, to give him the keys to a new trilogy.  There is a real confidence in his storytelling, and the humor laces itself in at just the right moments. The best moments in the movie were not teased out in the trailers.  Getting more development from Rey, Kylo, Finn, and Poe just has me thinking...More please!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If anything it makes me wonder how far Johnson could have gone if he'd been allowed to really take the next steps, the studio was clearly worried about him going over too many people's heads.

It is too long, has a weak plot, tries to hard to introduce humor and completely trashes everything from the original series. Kathleen Kennedy needs to be replaced for green lighting this trash. Where should I begin with this...<br/><br/>- Luke is completely off base from the original character. It’s almost like Rian Johnson never actually saw one of the original movies. A disappointing end of the signature character from the OT<br/>- they drop the ball on Rey’s parents, Snoke, and any cliffhanger from the first movie. They don’t seem to matter at all which is very unsatisfying - The film trashes everything from the original series in order to be new and different and bold. They problem is it replaces those aspects with nothing. The plot is thin and full of deviations that go nowhere (casinos chase on animals, random holocall to Max Kanata just to throw her in the mix for no real reason<br/>- there are no hooks for the last movie. No Han Solo frozen in carbonite or other things that leave you waiting for more. - the movie tries to preach that “the force is for everyone not just the jedi”. Great but that’s not a movie plot! The original series was about the hero’s journey, good vs. evil, the redemption of Anakin Skywalker. This one is just some bland message of inclusiveness that anyone can be a hero. Really? Sounds like a plot developed by a commitee It seems that either Disney has influenced all the “critics” who are reviewing the film or these people are too scared to say anything bad about about the movie for fear of losing access to films from a company that controls 40% of releases now that they own 21st Century Fox. These people are like the stock market analysts who say everything is a “buy” even if the company is garbage.  Rotten tomatoes is really suspect given the different between their critic ratings (93) and audience ratings (57) are so large. Not a surprise since they are owned by Fandango who sells online tickets. Bit of a conflict of interest perhaps?? I’m sure no one will investigate that though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Plot repeats in all 4 point of movie.If you loved the Original 3 your Leave this movie Sick to your Stomach it craps all over those. the Magic is gone for Star Wars for me,  I just don't care Now for future movies, I Don't .. Disney KILLED IT!! EA killed the GAME Disney Killed it in theaters. Its the Story/Writing its dogy Doo terrible Directing Horrendous Some acting very lacking ..Bright Spot Mark Hamil for what he was Dealt with..which he has mentioned in press past few months he didn't like what Director Wrote for him. We see now..   For those that have not seen is.. WAIT..till it comes out in DVD Not worth the Disappointment  I still have Sick feeling inside..Force Awakens & Rouge One Roced this makes Phantom Menace an Awesome in comparison. I never seen so many people Run out at a End of a Movie before.. like that one..I can only guess ticked off Fans..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I was 6 in 1977 when a New Hope was released.<br/><br/>Now on to Star Wars The Last Jedi.  Among the now 9 movies in the Star Wars universe I place this movie a close second behind Empire Strikes Back with Rogue One third.  This movie had a bit of everything in it and was a pleasure to watch for a true Star Wars fan.  If you only started enjoying the series with the Phantom Menace Trilogy or with the Force Awakens then there may be some parts that may seem repetitive or may not make that much sense.  To gain a true understanding of the movies you need to watch them not in chronological order from 1-8 with Rogue One in between 3-4 but rather how they came out: 4-6, 1-3, 7, Rogue One, 8.  This gives you a different understanding of the movies.<br/><br/>I have seen them both ways obviously.  I miss the unedited versions of episodes 4-6 from 1977-1983, George Lucas did the movies a dis-service by changing them, but, it was to correct his original vision so I understand.  I am not here to spoil any of The Last Jedi for anyone, just go see it in the theater, this is definitely a movie you want to see on the big screen.  It will probably take a few screenings to truly appreciate all of the aspects of the movie.  I have only seen it once so far and plan on seeing it many more times in the theater before it leaves.  Hope this help and May the Force Be With All of You.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Heteronormative much? Star Wars 7 (aka Force Awaken) led us diehard fans to believe that there was a budding romance between protagonists Finn and Poe Damoron. We waited anxiously with baited breath in hopes that we would finally get to see a genuine male/male (interracial) relationship on the silver screen. Star Wars was going to finally break the mold by presenting viewers with a gay couple we could root for but instead Disney pulled a classic bait-and-switch. I guess they had to cave into the demands of all the homophobic people that are in charge of things right now so they could convince their backwards manchild audience to cough up fifteen dollars. Fingers crossed that Finn is just doing this for appearances and Poe is actually the object of his heart's desires, but with the way things are going lately I wouldn't be surprised if Disney/Lucasfilm decide to churn out more exclusionary trash for their overwhelmingly straight white male gamer audience. The believability of the film is strained further by this forced cishet "romance". Finn is way too hot for Rose. It would be more believable if her character was trans, but again, that wouldn't play well with Disney's "core demographics" (aka BLORMPF voters aka the real life First Order). Disney will not be receiving another dollar from me after this stab in the back. I was literally shaking when I saw the on-screen kiss. I had to explain to my four bi-curious nephews (all of whom are under 8 years old) that it would be okay and that in the end the good guys would win. But in this age of Drumpf stealing our internet, I'm not so sure...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is a very well polished turd, the core story of the film is just so incredibly stupid. It kind of gives me the same type of feeling that Mass Effect 3 left me with. A form of emptiness. It was the first time I left the cinema after a Star Wars film and just felt zero excitement. Initially the movie was a 7/10 for me but the more I thought about it the more all the flaws got stacked up. For me The Last Jedi is a 4/10. It gets plus points for its beautiful cinematography, great acting from the main actors and by just being Star Wars.  I like the way they killed Snoke and that Kylo did it, but it happened too soon and we got ZERO **** INFO ABOUT HIM. Instead of the stupid Finn and Rose storyline they could have given us backstory to Snoke before killing him and actually have Rey trained by Luke on that **** island.<br/><br/>But it was so damn disappointing in so many ways, it felt like every time a key plotpoint was going to be answered and an "expected" conclusion could come, they went a whole other crazy non-logical direction just to prove a point. There were so many opportunities they could make a cool ass story out of this, but instead it gave us the most boring conclusion possible. Very sad about this film, it has literally left me emotionally scarred.<br/><br/>Also, that milk scene.﻿</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Everything feels shallow and calculated to generate headlines, from Laura Dern's token LGBT hero (who has zero personality, replaces Leia for a good chunk of the film for no good reason, and has obnoxiously dyed purple hair--a lesbian stereotype that has no place in a galaxy far, far away), to Snoke and Luke's premature deaths. If Rian Johnson wanted to divide fans, he succeeded, but at the cost of every woman and man who grew up hoping to see the day that the Luke Skywalker they knew and loved would return to the silver screen. Not even Rey comes out of this film unscathed; for all the flashy action scenes she and her adversary Kylo Ren get, there's no real character development. She's still very much the flawless Mary Sue that detractors of the previous film accused her of being: a natural-born Jedi who doesn't need training, doesn't even need to be taught the ways of the Force. A so-called feminist icon who isn't on track to be half the hero Luke ever was and there's only one film left to tell her story.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I'm not going to see the Solo movie. I may not even see Episode IX. George Lucas made the mistake of his life selling Star Wars to Disney, and I sincerely hope that they take the sheer number of bad moviegoer reviews this movie is getting to heart.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Ultimately, how it will be remembered comes down to the next film which is the biggest shame of this movie. I can see the complaints on the Disney-fication of this movie and it kinda blows, but the question this movie asks in Rey's storyline is one of the best in the series. There are a lot of questionable choices too. Rose and Finn's story should have been better and the way the Leia scene is shot makes a weird situation stupid, but I don't think it detracts from a fine story.<br/>Few more thing; 1) Kylo is the Anakin we never got. The conflict within him is better portrayed and the relationship between him and Rey helps show this to us. 2) Snoke being snuffed out is good. This story is about how bad, how far Kylo is willing to go. Him removing Snoke complicates things and allows him to either be more nuanced or balls to the wall evil.3) Poe being trapped on the ship doing nothing was good for him, it allowed him to grow as a character. I know we don't want that from a hothead, but it could be good. It comes down to how IX chooses to let it pay off. 4) Rewatch A New Hope and forget the rest of the series. Empire completely changed what that movie meant and what the series would become. So the people complaining about The Last Jedi recontextualizing The Force Awakens have simply forgotten the nature of sequels.<br/>Ultimately, the user score right now doesn't matter. How this movie is remembered will come down to how IX chooses to let this movie play out, which is why this movie will never be Empire or A New Hope, but also why this movie isn't worthless. Pray IX is good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Director was given freedom to craft the story he wanted. Lucas Film didn't guide his decisions. Big mistake. He chose to throw away much of the Force Awakens potential. That's what we've all been hyped about for 2 years. Finally seeing Luke, after all this time should have been epic. It wasn't. 2 words, nipple milk. Snoke demonstrates tons of force power but dies with no explanation of how he learned his skills, where he came from, how he turned Kylo...I've already rewritten 25% of the movie and my friends think it could have been best star wars yet. But it's not. Sadly a huge potential wasted. Hope Abrams brings us back a proper ending in the 3rd film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The only way they wont keep making this garbage is if people don't spend their money on it. Spoilers below.<br/><br/>Three separate times woman slap men in this movie. Every single woman in this movie is in a position of power over the men, even Rey who is brand new to the Force basically shows Luke he is worthless.<br/><br/>This is complete and utter feminist agenda being shoved down our throats star wars style. Male leads-Luke commits Suicide. Poe is a hothead who is slapped twice by woman told he only thinks with his dick and has horrible dialogue and told everything he has done in the movie is wrong.....but hey don't worry the two old woman are such believable generals he smiles and walks it off. Finn is a coward who needs a tiny chunky chick to show him what courage is? Really? Kylo is a emotional wreck. Good bad, spaz......just not a great character.<br/><br/>All the basic foot soldier men are just shot and killed and worthless.<br/><br/>Female Characters. Rey most powerful Jedi we have yet to see and she has had.....zero training! Ruins the whole idea of the whole damn universe. Leia...Superman much. Rose, really this is a war movie. Soldier do not look like that, or are that out of shape some training Rose please.....and then really she is preaching to Finn and out doing him in everything the whole movie....<br/><br/>Admiral Hudo are you kidding me its war and you show up in a skin tight gown.....<br/><br/>This movie breaks Cannon, it has more plot holes then you can count, it forgets its audience in a bold attempt to make it seem like men are idiots and woman the real power. I was in the theater with 95% males all of who came out of the movie feeling like what was this **** I just watched. The one redeeming quality of the movie is its pretty and shot well. Other then that it is clearly trying to take a super liberal agenda and force it down our throats. I have three daughters, none of whom want to see these movies. And my one daughter asked why the woman in the movie didnt look like they could fight if they where supposed to be in a war?<br/><br/>The scroll should have read like this....<br/><br/>Chapter 8: the feminist Jedi In a galaxy far far away men no longer have any intelligence, character, or back bone...the coward Luke has run from all of his responsibilities and tried to kill his apprentices in their sleep. Meanwhile the last of the Republiucs fleets powered by old woman in stunning gowns and make up despite going to battle lead the last of their forces to annihilation.<br/><br/>But Dont worry, our Betty Sue....oh I mean Rey is the most powerful Jedi of all time and didn't even need training......</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They need to try to understand where the haters are coming from and realize that there is some logic at play there, not just butthurt fanboys who are not "true fans." The film is too long, relies on a terrible chase through space sequence that makes no logical sense. If the first order outnumbers them a thousand to one, they could easily have other ships jump in ahead of their position and end it instantly. The fact that they do not do this makes the first order AGAIN look inept. The Canto Bite segment was unnecessary and BB8 constantly rescuing them through slapstick hijinx got old really quick. Like VII, just constantly too many plot holes to avoid. How did Rey get back on the Falcon after Snoke? How did Finn drag Rose 2 miles back to the entrance without getting shot in less than a few minutes? How did Rey know to look for them escaping through the back tunnel? That is just the tip of the iceberg. It is not us fans being salty- it is us expecting better when there IS some amazing SW fiction out there right now that is wonderful. The Comics, Rebels tv show-- feel more like the SW universe that we grew up with and know. This is something else. Something that is just not well thought out. VII was a step in the wrong direction, this is the second step in that same direction. Let's not even talk about the fact that the questions they have been baiting us with for years in regards to Snoke and her parents, do not even matter at all. Done with with soap opera that used to be a space opera.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
