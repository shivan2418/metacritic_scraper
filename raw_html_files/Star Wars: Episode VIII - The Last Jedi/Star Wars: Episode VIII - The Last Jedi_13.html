It destroys everything that has been accomplished in the past movies, even in the force awakens! What were they thinking? Didn't they write the whole trilogy before they started filming it? How amateur is that? Anyway, boring movie, plot holes everywhere, horrendous character development (poor Luke), bad writing, useless plots, bad humoristic tone, lack of tension... I could continue all night but I will stop. This movie doesn'et deserve talking about it. They just destroyed a beloved saga. I won't bother to see the next movie. To me, the star wars saga contains 6 films. No more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

We had Lando - who doesn't love Lando? Yet, his character did not ever come across as "filler" or unnecessarily added to an already large list of new characters meeting legacy characters. Well, peeps, that's exactly what this movie is though. Frankly, it's a mess, but at the least I can give it that it was entertaining and at times interesting. The problem with the characters is that it tries to build on the established cast from The Force Awakens while struggling to put the past to rest, a theme which is actually quite dominant this time, and by the credits you'll finally have a sense that Episode 9 has a chance of standing on its own legs instead of Disney's nostalgia pandering. It's just hard to see the originality that's left as something positive amidst all the cringeworthy and disservicing amounts of diversity-pandering. Characters you desperately want to love like Finn are shafted as a comedic-relief character who goes on a circular subplot full of all the worst aspects of the prequel trilogy and the tone of your average Disney Channel sit-coms, all with its own fart-sniffing jokes and white-toothed family-friendly smile. It feels ingenuine and detracts from the entire film when they try to juxtapose the actual plot development of Rey, Luke and Kylo Ren with this vapid attempt at making the movie accessible to kids. I understand it's family friendly but it comes off as needlessly cheesy and forced. As for the actual plot it starts off well in several arcs that get set up. Rey actually shows a bit more weakness, doubt and humanity but ultimately returns to her Sue self as she keeps nailing every obstacle in her first try and every scene where she struggles is set up almost without context, just like what they do with the "mysterious" character Snoke. It doesn't help everything somehow fits into a formulaic retread of Empire Strikes Back. That said, there's just enough few snippets of actual ingenuity and idea-making from Rian Johnson's input to make this movie somewhat worthwhile. It's very inconsistent however, and while on one hand the director/writer shows he cares about the lore and how the Force is most popularly represented (as a mythical, almost zen-like concept, NOT midichlorians or science-fact)  he abuses the concept so often in very pivotal scenes that the audience winds up laughing making it hard to figure out it these were legit attempts at doing the "Marvel Comedy Action" routine or just an attempt to do something novel that feels too weird. It can suck the emotion out of important scenes as much as it can pique your interest thinking it's going somewhere. Ultimately, The Last Jedi mostly turned out to feel self-serving in its novel attempts at adding something new to the canon but at the very least it seemed to finally let go of the Original Trilogy circlejerk as its final message, but then it's too bad Episode 9 is directed by J.J. "Remix" Abrams once again, who will certainly undo all Rian's efforts at seperating the new trilogy from its nostalgia for the past. If Rian were to direct the sequel, I would be very, very interested however.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The last film deletes the achievements of the original trilogy, but perhaps most disrespctful are the blunt retcons. The whole movie pretends to be surprising, critics praise it for subverting expectations, but I can't help to think it's just badly written when the main point of the previous movie was getting the map to Luke Skywalker, which Luke himself left hidden so that the Rebels, in time of need, may find him and seek his aid. This movie completely forgets that point and pretends it never existed. This is not surprising plot twist, it's just cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I just want to give you my story. We were about 15 people watching The Last Jedi, ranging from guys in their early 40ies having grown-up with Star Wars to 20-somethings with basically no idea whats the difference between Star Wars and Star Trek. None of us would qualify as a hardcore fan-boy and nobody had some kind of fan fiction in his mind. But its fair to say, that everybody having seen TFA was expecting answers.<br/><br/>After the movie we compared our thoughts and rated the movie. The best vote came from someone in her twenties, she thought the movies was ok-ish, but she wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to friends. This could translate to something like 4 stars, maybe 5, if you feel generous. Worst reaction was along the lines of "what a pile of garbage", so all other ratings were below that, maybe in the range of 1-3 stars. Drilling further down, everybody felt insulted by the same things, independent of "Star Wars experience". A nice quote from that evening was "how stupid does Disney believe me to be?". So all of us were offended by immense amount of plotholes, absurd storytelling, meaningless story arcs and plain silly behaviour of basically anybody in the movie. We couldn't identify a single character showing something like common sense, or signs of intelligence, or basic military training.<br/><br/>None of us felt insulted by the choices made by Rian Johnson, all of us were good with the direction of the story, with the single exception of Luke trying to murder his nephew in his sleep. However, none of us felt that the story was new, or original, or unexpected. Basically its an amalgamation of The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and Battlestar Galactica, especially the episode 33. We had this "been there done that" feeling quite a lot.<br/><br/>Finally, most of us were annoyed by the forced humor, calling it misplaced. Star Wars was always kind of funny, but a lot of the jokes simply felt plain wrong and out of character. Maybe on a side-note: 2 guys swore to never drink milk again. On a personal note: That was the single-most disgusting scene I have seen last year.<br/><br/>So whats the verdict? From my point of view The Last Jedi is maybe the worst movie of the year. Interestingly it is not failing because of whats happening (story, characters, choices...) is failing because of how (no logic, plotholes, retconning lore...) it happens. Just a few examples: - What is the logic behind trying to sneak of a cruiser in smaller freighters, when you are within viewing distance???<br/>- How is it possible, that a fleet of Star Destroyers with 1.500 turbo laser cannons each can't overload the shields of an old cruiser???<br/>- Why don't send 2 ships ahead at lightspeed creating an effective trap???<br/>- Why not simply launch all TIEs in the first place? The first order fleet should have at least 1.000...<br/>- How can DJ betray a plan, Finn and Rose don't know and haven't talked about??? Was he the only guy looking out of the window???<br/>- Why do several attack walkers with the order to kill everybody from the resistance not shoot Finn and Rose???<br/>- How is possible to run severals miles faster than giant attack walkers while carrying someone and arriving just in time to be evacuted with everybody else???<br/>- Why do you risk the single most important mission for the survival of the resistance with wrong parking???<br/>- Why is Snoke loosing at the same time his common sense, his peripheral vision, his hearing and his feeling of the force???<br/>- How can someone with no training overcome half a dozen highly trained personal guards meant as a last defense???<br/>- If there is blaster-proof armor, why not issue it to all stormtroopers???<br/>- How do you survive a direct hit by 2 torpedos, the vacuum of space while already being frozen over and how do you open a door without everybody being sucked into space???</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I paid matinee prices so I didn't get too ripped off but wow I'd be really mad to pay full price and do 3D too! Everything is wrong here, nothing makes one moment of sense, the acting is just terrible beyond words (except Mark Hamill), everything feels out of order most of the time and never for a moment was I thinking "wow this is going great." I see what happened here now, Disney's Kathleen Kennedy stated in an interview they write stories then fit characters around them. They don't write for the sake of characters. That's exactly what this felt like, as if the stories being given had no relation to any of these people we learned about in Force Awakens, instead it feels like they have been put into an alternate universe where everything has different universal constants/laws even peoples thought processes. I never thought a modern day film could ever be this bad, especially one with such a large budget as this I KNOW NOW I WAS WRONG. Nothing can fix this mess, it's written worse than a childs story, it's absurd nonsense that goes nowhere. I'd rather watch the prequels every single day of my life than see this one more time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

First of all, Snoke is obsessed with killing Luke because he represents hope in the universe. Fair enough. Only problem is that Kylo collapsed a hut on him and didn't finish the job! We know Kylo is in contact with Snoke at that point because Luke says as much. That was his reasoning for almost murdering the teenager in his sleep. Kylo survived the hut crashing down so why in the F'n world would he (and Snoke) not think Luke, a JEDI MASTER, also survived? Especially considering that Kylo and his supporters, whom we NEVER see (The Knights of Ren weren't even mentioned in TLJ despite Snoke titling Kylo "Master of the Knights of Ren" in Force Awakens) taking the time to murder the rest of Luke's apprentices. Ugh! Also, in several of the Disney cannon novels (and Rogue One) Darth Vader relies on his pressurized suit to withstand the vacuum of space, but Leia is so much more powerful than even a dark Lord of the Sith to the point that she can use the force to survive total exposure to space. Good grief! Worst of all, however, is the scene where Luke tosses the lightsaber. His F'N father's lightsaber! AND he reaches for it with the hand that was lost while wielding it! The very lightsaber that Obi Wan collected and handed down to him for training. If someone handed you a family heirloom, especially one with such significance and nostalgia, would you just toss it away like yesterday's garbage? And all this is just the tip of the iceberg. TLJ once broken down, is rife with horrible dialogue, incompetent editing and just a plainly obvious trash script. The final straw for me was having a casino scene that would've perfectly set up re-introducing Lando Calrissian (remember how he was one of the four major characters?) only to have...wait for it...Justin Theroux as the gambler contact??! Finally, if Luke never wanted to be found and rather just die a useless, cranky old hermit, why the F did he give R2D2 his coordinates??? And why after so much time and so many prior adventures together did C3PO get nothing more than a wink from him??? The worst part of all of this is that Disney loved this trite so much they give the hack director Rian Johnson a Star Wars trilogy?

Luke dies in squandered manner.  Rey is textbook Ultra Mary Sue.  Shes seems to grow more powerful the less she knows.  If she continues to receive no training, she will be able to move planets with her pinky.<br/>SJW characters abound, nothing like getting political for no reason #2017.  Plot holes are like mines in a mine field here.  There are soo many!!  It can only be safely navigated with the proper mine sweeper (give up caring).  Death stars can be defeated by light speed missiles now and everyone before this movie was an idiot for not realizing a new style of hyper weapons.  The casino planet is unbearable.  Free animals, ignore children.  I figured it would be a 5 minute sub plot, but it was over half an hour of RICH PEOPLE EVIL.  I get it!  Please let me off this ride!!  Leia is apparently 100x stronger than any other Jedi before.  Space is no consequence to her, and oxygen is not required.  Perhaps it is only females do not require any training to use the force?  Kylo Ren in this movie changes his position on topics ever 10th second in the movie and is almost unwatchable. Too AngstEdgy for me.  Snoke was the best villain ever.  Without consent, can connect users minds and facilitate a skype call.  Force lightning through holograms.  Overpowers overpowered Rey like its nothing.  To be betrayed by his pupil while giving a diatribe on how he could never be betrayed by his pupil.  There are non relevant props that are treated with more love, backstory and screentime than Snoke (Porg/Crystal Foxes).<br/><br/>0/10 for this since the director (Ryan) is being rewarded and allowed to create his own trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Minor improvements in small areas such as further fleshing out Kylo Ren, his relationship with Luke, and his complicated relationship with the dark side. The main two stories being told in this movie are very unsatisfying and sometimes feel like a downright slap in the face to the franchise in general. If you are a Star Wars fan, you will see things that will make you question their motives and direction of the franchise. Still there is some classic Star Wars charm to the movie in areas. Unfortunately those moments are overburdened by bad pacing and lack of focus or connection. There is still good in this film and hopefully they are zeroing in on the magic that made this franchise what it is today. May the Force be with you all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson continues his personal series of flops by writing this awful fan-fiction. It focuses on the father-daughter relationship with Luke & Rey, and mostly a simple young female janitor to set-up a trite romance with Finn later on. There’s extraordinary pacing issues, and the longstanding characters act as though this is their very first Star Wars film. There is no pay-off in the end, and the humor is particularly bad. It tries so hard to be different in formula from The Empire Strikes Back, that it does nothing exciting. What could’ve been a fantastic departure from the obvious sci-fi standard is instead a tedious spin-off. Episode IX could ignore The Last Jedi entirely and no one would be the wiser.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rey is now a super Jedi with no proper training. Poe is an idiot, Finn does nothing. Leia and Luke's characters are just treated badly with no continuity with previous canon films regarding the Force, especially Luke. How they took an iconic character who's motivations we know from the previous films and then crap all over that history and expect people to accept it? I left the cinema stunned and the more I thought about what I saw the more I grew to dislike and now I absolutely hate the film.

The casino arc is trash, if the producers really wanted it to still be in the film, they should have just made Finn and Poe go together and scrapped Rose. The grating humor is out of place in a film where the good guys are being annihilated. Jumping to hyperspace as a weapon goes against the very idea of hyperspace and if it is a viable strategy, why not have any of the support ships of the rebel fleet sacrifice itself with a droid pilot at the start of the film. For that matter, why not jump a ship into the first and second Death Star in the original films, the introduction of this tactic is completely unjustified and not well thought out. This film makes the events of episode 7 completely irrelevant and implies that no level of attack on the First Order will have any effect. Apparently, destroying star killer base did nothing but kill Han while causing no permanent damage to the first order. Why must we not see Luke performing any acts of true power, it saddens me that the chosen one who defeated Vader and the Emperor is relegated to mere astral projection as the extent if his power. Next Leia apparently has the force power to survive the vacuum of space despite no real previous indication that she could do more than sense some truths through the force. Please, this is 2017 how can the animation of her flying through space back to the ship be laughably bad. Why god, did they have to ruin Rey's back story - there were so many amazing options they could have gone with, but they chose to make her essentially and orphan (the most cliche and lazy back story imaginable). Why did we get the casino arc instead of a Rey back story? Next, how can the all-wise, all-seeing Snoke be defeated by such a crappy trick as that employed by Kylo?<br/><br/>The only really redeeming parts of this film are those with the force link between Rey and Kylo, the scene with the dark side cave, and the fight between Rey/Kylo and the praetorian guard.<br/><br/>All together, I fail to see how any critic with a "developed" cinematic pallet could say this is a good movie. This film is a disgrace to the Star Wars inheritance, and I can not imagine how a critic could think otherwise without having been bribed or strong-armed into a good review by the demonic Disney executives seeking to keep the film from tanking in the box office. The entire casino subplot is a worthless arc motivated by the typical Hollywood political sentiment that is incapable of seeing its own hypocrisy - like DiCaprio lecturing us on the environment while hosting birthday parties on mega yachts and hiring private planes. Lead by example you swinish, elitist, Hollywood hypocrits!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If you liked episodes 1-3 and are bored of the original 4-7, this one is for you. It will likely be very profitable. And I think it gives a good view of what 'that Star Wars thing' looks like from the perspective of people who haven't seen any SW films.<br/><br/>Cons: The plot is muddled, and it's hard to get into all of the low-stakes rabbit trails that the characters take. The main innovation seems to be self-parodying jokes that refer to how wacky it's become. This will probably appeal to people who see the Star Wars franchise as an opportunity for comedy, but it doesn't otherwise really bring any significant developments. I still have faith that Disney can come up with some original ideas that don't blatantly contradict themselves and move the story forward, but they haven't reached it yet.<br/><br/>Also, if hyperdrives were that explosive you'd think they would have developed light-speed torpedoes long ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I must recoginze there is some stuff that doesn't work, but it isn't strong enough to ruin the movie.<br/><br/>For anyone who has seen the trailers, the story is mainly about the relationship that Ray and Luke develop and I must say that the evolution of their relationship is pretty solid and it works well. Something pretty important in any movie is to give all of the characters something to do, and everyone gets to do something in this movie. The fact that every character has a function in the story makes it long in a good way because we get to know what every character will have to face and go through in an upcoming sequel.<br/><br/>the cinematography is beautiful ,the effects are great, the story is unique and different from the others, some of the jokes are good and some of the jokes are bad, and the social comentary given in the film about war is a theme of influence in the story.<br/><br/>I would even dare to say that this new entry on the Star Wars saga is the best in the series, because it follows a new story that is different form any other of the other ones (and that is better than the prequels), that avoids cliches and keeps some of the elements that are proper from any other Star Wars film.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie is different doesn't mean it's bad, keep that in mind. Because of all of this, the good and the bad is that The Last Jedi is getting an 8 out of 10<br/><br/>Thank you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Where to begin. Ok, first up. The script is bad. Not just on a technical level (I'm a writer, and it is, it realy realy is), but also because Rian Johnson seems not to like Star Wars. The dialogue is atrocious, and makes the cardinal error of spelling out everything that is happening. This is screenwriting 101. The tone is just OFF. It isn't Star Wars. There are tonal lurches all over the place. Bad humour. No sense of jeopardy. Idioms from the real world circa 2010-2020. The source of tension was so ridiculously contrived as to be non existent. The thing that realy makes this hurt even more, is that a lot of good ground work had been done beforehand with the Force Awakens, which wasn't perfect but gave us a nice set up. Rian purposefully throws it all in the bin (when he isn't aiming jibes at Star Wars fans). I also thought Rogue One was pretty excellent. You managed to tease me in to thinking it was possible to get semi decent new Star Wars, and now this. There's more. Much more. But I'm not going to go in to it. I actually can't believe they managed to murder it this badly. The one redeeming element was the performance of Daisy Ridly and the fact Rian isn't directing the 3rd one. The special effects, while often tonally off at least clearly had a decent amount of talent behind. What a shame it was so badly misdirected. I'm off to watch Rogue One. That's how you do it. Please, please, Disney. Don't let that man near another Star Wars film. Never mind a whole trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie is poor from two perspectives. First as a movie in general, e.g. script, plot, characters, and cinematic. and second as a star wars franchise movie.<br/><br/>1). This is just a poorly done movie / cinematic. --- contrived plot<br/>--- poor character development, e.g. characters do not evolve, they remain static in their understanding of events and conflict from beginning until the end.<br/>--- forced diversity, the character 'Rose' reeks of Disney forcefully placing ethnic diversity into the film as a matter of making a check on list. There is no point to this character and events or responsibilities of this character do not make any sense and are meaningless.<br/><br/>2) Bad Star Wars franchise movie<br/>---No adherence to cannon. e.g. not consistent with established 'rules' of 'The Force'(e.g. Jedi training). Why didn't rebels use hyperspace kamikaze to former threats in previous movies?<br/>---The visuals and action were a step down from previous movies. Where is the  masterful Jedi vs. Sith light saber scene? Where is the Jedi taking control of the battle field or space in conflict?<br/>---Lukes climatic buildup carried from episode VII was a big nothing and inconsistent with his matured character from Return of the Jedi. To be frank, we all wanted to see Luke's bad ass Master Jedi skills in action to save the resistance. ---No climatic battle with Supreme leader Snoke... by the way, can holy wood get away from the contrived throne room? No rulers sit day in and day out in a throne room. At least Darth Sidious's room was more of a command viewpoint to watch galactic warfare.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Basically Starwars is over, now we will get Disney Wars, similar to avengers. Maybe they will do Star Wars meet Avengers next, knowing Disney this is exactly where this is going.

I wanted to be surprised and shocked (in a good way) after the nostalgia hash of TFA. But instead it made me feel angry from the start, as it became clear that this movie had thrown out TFA. I get that Rian Johnson didn't want to just blindly follow Abram's mystery boxes. But it felt like he'd only read a a two page summary of TFA and didn't care about creating a trilogy. The plots were also disappointing. The theme was failure, I got that quickly,but the film was a failure. Seriously, after the movie in just walked out with my nephew and we both just said we didn't want to talk about it. Everyone I've spoken to who saw it thought it played for cheap laughs and made fun of characters who deserved better plotlines and character arcs. There were some amazing things about this movie. But it fundamentally failed to engage me or excite me. I don't want to see the next movie. I don't want to watch more meaningless pap which critics have portrayed as the best ever Star Wars ever. I won't watch the next one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Having grown up with the OT, I'm a long-time Star Wars fan, although not a fanatic, and I really enjoyed TFA, despite its flaws. I am giving TLJ 1/2 point for cinematography (although I felt there was too much CGI; JJ Abrams did a much better job mixing practical effects with CGI in TFA), a 1/2 point for the musical score, a 1/2 point for the audio, and a 1/2 point for the acting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the plot and lack of consistency with Star Wars cannon/lore is what ruins this movie for me. There are tons of plotholes (summarized very well by many other reviewers) and ridiculous plot devices are employed repeatedly (too much deus ex machina and too many "gotcha" moments, just for the sake of trying to surprise the audience without them adding anything to the overall narrative). The main plot and subplots mostly go nowhere, leaving us with little interest in what happens in the next movie. The tone is often off (e.g., the entire Canto Bight sequence feels like something from Harry Potter). The comedy was over-the-top and bordering on slapstick at times (e.g., Luke throwing the lightsabre over his shoulder). The characters are either uninteresting (e.g., Rose), annoying (e.g., Rose, Holdo), poorly developed (e.g., how does Rey become so powerful and proficient with minimal training?), or inappropriately handled (e.g., Finn, Poe, Snoke, and especially Luke; Mark Hamill was right to voice his concerns). There are few compelling character arcs. The new force abilities demonstrated are inconsistent with what we have seen in any of the preceding films and are, for the most part, ridiculous (e.g., Leia flying through space, astral projection, force FaceTime, etc). Although I was not invested in any of the major fan theories leading up to the movie, I did find it annoying that many questions posed by TFA were either ignored or answered in a very underwhelming way. As many other reviewers have pointed out, why make a big deal of these questions only to discard or minimize them in the sequel? Also, the political messages (e.g., anti-capitalism, animals rights, etc) did not need to be in there and added little to the overall narrative.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'm not a bot or a member of the alt-right. I'm just someone who likes (liked?) Star Wars. I have absolutely no problem with having female protagonists and an ethnically diverse cast. I can only hope that Disney and Lucasfilm are taking the audience feedback seriously. They had the perfect setup to make an awesome Star Wars movie that moved the story forward in a meaningful satisfying way, but they blew it. I know it's impossible to please everyone, but there is a middle ground that I think would satisfy the majority of serious and casual fans. As we have learned with TLJ, having great actors, cinematography, CGI, and musical score will not save a movie with a terrible plot and screenplay.... P.S. I *really* wanted to love this movie. Extremely disappointed....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Los personajes no solo carecen de motivaciones concretas o realistas, además son torpes y muy bufones. Es como si Starwas se mezclara con Guardianas de la Galaxia, lo que produce confusión y hace muy ridículas muchas partes. Disney ha llevado el film a una exposición de múltiples personajes y naves para vender. (Spoilers de aquí en adelante) La fuerza y lo que la fuerza puede ser sigue distorsionada y no pretende ser canónica. La trama NO responde ninguna de las preguntas sobre Rey, ni sobre Snoke, ni sobre la fuerza como energía en este nuevo escenario, o el Rol político del Nuevo Orden. Incluso la aparición de Yoda es tonta e innecesaria!!.  Luke está distorsionado como personaje (lo dijo Mark Hamill en entrevistas) aquí hay un buena interpretación pero el problema esta en la trama. Los agujeros en la trama son EVIDENTES, suenan a recortes de montaje, pero aun así, no están a la altura de lo que yo espero de un film como este. puntos a su favor es que debe ser el episodio más bello, visualmente hablando, de toda la saga... Pero la capacidad del director  no logra dar en el tono para sacar adelante un guión débil como este.<br/>Lo único correcto para mi es el título "El último Jedi" ya que es el último que veré en el cine, Disney mató la franquicia, el resto de los episodios por venir los veré  en el TV cable. La esencia de Starwars ha muerto.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

On one hand, there are genuinely shocking moments in this movie. Characters you thought were good have a dark side. Those who should be wise act foolishly, and a single decent act doesn't suddenly make a bad guy good. If you think you know which way this thing will go purely on a narrative level, you're probably wrong. For a Star Wars movie, that unpredictability is refreshing.<br/>What really doesn't help The Last Jedi is how grossly bloated it is with circuitous subplots, narrative cul-de-sacs, and detours that amount to little more than distractions. The movie's main event is actually a drawn out stalemate between Snoke's armada and Leia's pathetic forces, which probably wasn't a smart structural choice for a middle movie that would have threatened to drag even without a lengthy standoff in the middle.<br/>That sounds grim, but The Last Jedi gets many important things right too. Like The Force Awakens, it's beautiful to behold. It's also just the right amount of funny. Even the Porgs, which drew such a following before the movie had even released, provide the right amount of cute without feeling overused.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm a huge fan of the SW universe. I even enjoyed episodes II & III (especially III), so I consider myself as easy to please when it comes to this great saga.<br/><br/>There are many, many things I HATED about this movie, but to make things shorter I will list only 3 of my grudges. I picked them cause I felt other reviews didn't really expanded on them.<br/><br/>1) They ruined the First Order's credibility as a genuine, menacing evil entity. How can a movie be any good if the evil protagonists are a laughing stock? In the early trilogy, the Empire was such a mean, impressive, cold hearted machine. Even the poorly trained Storm Troopers (did they all skip shooting training?) couldn't take anything away from the fear the Empire instilled. They had Vader and the Emperor, of course, but it wasn't just about that... Here, First Order is a joke. I mean who is stillscared of them after this movie? They can't take down a single X-Wing fighter with their most advanced war cruiser and full fleet, because he's "too close to its guns"? Who can believe that? No, Rian Johnson wanted to make sure Poe's the hero once again. I did buy in when Poe took down 5-6 Tie fighters over the village in episode VII (he's an ace fighter after all), and that was a sight of beauty! But here, making a joke of a super destroyer like that takes all the fun away. I mean would you believe it if a Japanese WWII fighter pilot single handedly destroyed all the guns of a huge US battleship cruising in battle formation with destroyers, aircraft carriers, etc.. it felt the same. I know it's science fiction and all but basic rules of good story telling still apply. We don't buy it.<br/>Other examples:<br/>-they get fooled by a prank call (yes, I'm not making this up, sadly...)<br/>-they take forever to destroy a severely diminished Resistance fleet -they don't see it at first when such fleet sends all its escape pods towards a nearby planet (wait, weren't the First Order's fleet focusing 100% on their attention on said Resistance fleet?)<br/>-When they capture Rose & Finn, Phasma go full "James Bond bad guy" and take forever to dispose of them. In fact, guess what: she takes just enough time for them to be saved at the last moment. A good one : -Rey is able to escape safely after pretty much being in the heart of the main battleship and killing their Great Leader. Her escape from the battleship after the fight is so easy in fact, that it's not even worth one single second of screen time to explain how she did it! (note to self: when you're captured by the First Order, you'll be fine). -Their general (Hux) behaves like an angry teenager who makes hasty decisions.. Correction: I meant their new Great Leader (Ren).. wait, they both sound and behave like angry teenagers... Don't look for evil masterminds or deadly composure in the First Order's leadership. -The evilest of the evilest, the great and mysterious Snoke, is met with a swift and stupid demise that ridicule him.<br/><br/>Need I even continue the list?<br/><br/>2) The very, very poor lightsaber fights. I mean there are none. There's a time when they use lightsabers against other melee weapons, wielded by Snoke's elite body guards. But it's not Star Wars worthy. Save a few sparks (Rey's hand switch, Ren's light sabre headshot), it's simply a melee weapons brawl like you've seen countless times in medieval era movies, or pirates movies. They need to hire back the fight choreographers of episode III ASAP. Also, Kylo Ren's lightsaber may be the coolest looking thing ever, like a medieval sword... but slight problem: it seems to also have THE WEIGHT of a medieval sword. He looks so slow when he wields it!! It could be good, it could give him this unique style if he was assured and composed as a fighter, but he seems unsure, plus he has low agility, low creativity in his fighting. He seems quickly on the edge, without control (that was true also in Force Awakens). I mean you remember Sidious vs Yoda? Or Anakin vs Kenobi? Or, in a different style, the composure of a Darth Vador ? We want more of this! This is the standard on which you build on. Make it more gritty, more realistic if you want, but damn it Disney how dare you deprive us of an exciting and proper lightsaber fight!<br/><br/>3) Rey's "training" with Luke. I'm glad they pushed what we know of the Force to the edge. That was great. But what was this "training" for Rey? Recap: Lesson 1, some life philosophy.. "The force is everywhere my dear". Lesson 2: "a jedi can be bad also, you know". Lesson 3... I don't even think there was a 3rd. Thank goodness. Ok, now, with that, go be a great Jedi Rey!<br/><br/>And here I'm just brushing over the many problems (humor, casino scene, Rose's character, cheesy slave children arc, timing, Luke's behavior, etc). This Star Wars movie felt like a bad Battlestar Galactica episode, with a fleet chasing another fleet, depriving us of what we wanted from Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This film is completely barmy. It's main theme is failure. They take a giant dump on everything that was canon beforehand and make the most appalling effort at reuniting the space twins after thirty years apart (spoiler: they talk about hair). This is meant to be Star Wars! Bad ass Sith Lords blowing up planets and force choking people! Instead we get realistic milking and a 'Train to be a Jedi' Course that might as well have been advertised on Wowcher. For me, the original Trilogy and Rogue One are the only films that have that genuine star wars feel. The rest is just awful.

But if you're a die hard star wars fan then you'll find it pretty disappointed.<br/>I am a star wars fan myself. And I would like to say this movie does not deserve  0 nor 10. I've seen movies better and worse than this.<br/>It is really difficult for a sequel to surpass its predecessor. And the team try to do their best. They wiped out some of most beloved characters in order to tell you this is a new era, and we should let go the past. That' partially true.<br/>Let's talk about the movie itself:<br/>- It's a two and a half hour movie. But I think they should focus more on the main storyline. There're some sub-plot fits better with novel or comic but not the movies.<br/>- Splendid visual. Disney just simply doesn't disappoint us.<br/>- Bad pun. I don't know Disney tries to let the franchise more children friendly or what. Some of humor just feel unnecessary with Star Wars itself.<br/>- Unbelievable moments. I don't want to contain spoilers in this review. But sometimes the plot just blows your mind. In a bad way. You'll feel like: Come on this is not how it's gonna work.<br/>- Lots of battles. Those space battles are really satisfying. But I still want to see more duel between light-saber users.<br/>- Commercial elements. For unknown reason, I always think some character, robot, creature are added because it can be a cash grab for Disney aiming at younger audience. Just a feeling.<br/><br/>It's still a Star Wars movie, but the plot is really the drawback on this episode. Unless they find out a way to blow our mind in episode IX. I'll give it 5 out of 10 now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie was not all bad-- for example, the movie had good special effects and beautiful scenes at times; Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren and Mark Hamill's performance as the character he was forced to be were very good-- but in the end, this movie did not feel like "Star Wars".  Why could Rey who had very little to no training at all easily defeat Luke Skywalker who was a Master Jedi who actually did train with a master as well as defeat a throne room full of praetorian guards (albeit with Kylo Ren's help) also trained to defend Snoke?  I can understand that they are saying that Rey has a lot of raw power, but that doesn't mean that she automatically knows how to levitate a mountain of boulders, use mind tricks and wield a light saber.  It has been well established that it takes much time and training to become proficient at using the Force, but not in this movie!  I get that they were trying to introduce the new characters and make them the focus of the movie, but Rian Johnson seemed to go against everything that was already established and purposely change things just to be different-- and this was all done to the detriment of the characters and the Star Wars mythos.  Why can Yoda, as a force ghost, conjure lightning to affect the real world?  If he can do that, why aren't other force ghosts fighting the First Order and vice versa?  Also, if Leia who was only force sensitive can fly back to the ship when she is blown out, why couldn't Emperor Palpatine keep himself from falling down the reactor shaft when Vader threw him down it?  It also seems that Rian Johnson purposely went out of his way to prove all of the online speculation and theories that surfaced after The Force Awakens wrong by coming up with the most ridiculous thing he could fathom and putting it in the movie.  Not only that, but it seems as if he gave JJ Abrams the finger by saying, "I don't care about all of the plotlines you set up in The Force Awakens" and proceeded to drop them with no answers.  Why did Luke leave a map to find him in The Force Awakens?  Why did he consider murdering his nephew that he only sensed darkness in while not giving up on his father Darth Vader who had actually murdered scores of people?  In the end, this movie managed to push me away from the Star Wars franchise as I will likely not be taking my family to see the next film in the series.  If the director is willing to do this to Luke Skywalker, why bother investing any time in any new characters?  If they are not going to remake this movie, the best thing Disney could do at this point is start the next movie by Luke coming to from a vision of clips from The Last Jedi after Rey hands him the light saber and Rey asking him, "Luke, can you hear me?", to which he answers, "I have to try to save them..."</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is a mystery to me how he can consider himself a Star Wars fan. Perhaps what he really means is that he was a fan of Star Wars action figures, because that's what this movie feels like--a child playing with the figures, smashing them together, throwing them across the room. Having a ball of a time with them and yet, not understanding any of the characters they represent.

Quite simply I was glued & fixated to the screen and all the various plot twists & turns, smokescreens & mirrors & misdirection's, and as for the humour, it was absolutely awesome and brought back some of those thoughts & feelings I had not experienced in a movie since young childhood & The Original Movie.  So I felt that Official Reviewers throughout very many Media Realms had gotten it correct in Quality Reviews & reflected that position in there scores.  Even character & actors I had not been overly impressed with in Episode VII had really upped there performances & contributions, if episode VII set the scene in a very narrow focussed World, then Episode VIII Expands that World Massively in multiple directions.<br/><br/>At some later point I became aware that attention was being drawn to RottenTomatoes & Metacritic Scores suggesting that Audiences are not happy blah blah blah & that the critics and so on had gotten it incorrect.<br/><br/>What could I do? Had I been that wrong? Well I wanted to see the film a 2nd time anyway and attended a 2D screening.  Although I can cope with popular 3D, I usually between the 2, prefer 2D finding 3D effects etc.  to often be an undesirable distraction.  So on the second viewing there was less surprise, though very many details that you might miss within one sitting become apparent.  Visually the film is jam-packed from scene to scene & sequence to sequence with very many 'references' or nods to other loved films & Star Wars Realms & this is where some segments of Fan-base are falling over themselves to make idiots of themselves in the critique. You may well suggest that A DIE HARD Fan would have to have knowledge of Star Wars throughout a Cinematic Realm, The Comic & Book Realm, The Video Game Realm, and so on.  The film effectively & conclusively manages to include styles & ideas from across The Star Wars Empire or Universe, and most of the alleged 'Expert Fan' "complaints" actually do not hold water very well, if at all, because they are arriving from a "PURIST" knowledge viewpoint of cinema, or a "PURIST" knowledge viewpoint of comic book, or a "PURIST knowledge viewpoint of videogames.<br/><br/>My love for Star Wars began when I was very young, and that continued when I was 10, 20, 30, 40 - during that time period I have entertained dipping my toe (so to speak) in reading some odd comics & books and playing videogames as well as loving the Movie Series, so the wisdom I can perhaps share, is that this movie is being complained about by EXCEPTIONALLY SELFISH "diehard" 20 somethings or diehard 30 somethings who still want total possession & control of how they want the Star Wars realm to be for only themselves & their particular favourite realm gang or Audience Demographic.<br/><br/>The Movie Makers have effectively made a movie that spans generational tastes & realm tastes<br/>effectively making what I would call a REAL INTERGENERATIONAL FAMILY MOVIE that can be enjoyed by people of all tastes & age ranges and has a special appeal to the young, perhaps experiencing there first or earliest special cinema trip at Christmas, just as the Original Movie was experienced by myself and friends during our young childhoods.<br/><br/>If you go in with dogmatic preconceived ideas as to how the movie has to be shaped & played out, then you will likely join the negativity gangs.  If you go in open minded and wanting a fresh Star Wars or indeed Movie Experience that does not follow or conform to very many ideas that you might have thought of prior to seeing the movie, then you will likely walk out with a big grin, checking your diary as to when you can see it again and finding out when it is available on DVD or Streaming Services.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie missed a huge chance to be truly great. People don't see this franchise as just another movie, SW is a cultural phenomena that people feel invested in and Disney has shown a lot of disrespect to the original fanbase that made this franchise great. Also I'm all in for strong female characters and diversity in the cast, but forcing a political agenda with poor writing is truly sad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

When a Star Wars fan watches Star Wars, they see the archetypal hero's journey in full effect--full with a deep mythological force as old as storytelling itself. When you make a Star Wars film that tries to chuck all of that out the window to 're-invent' or 'subvert' the previous saga...a Star Wars fan just sees random crap about space and aliens. And that's why critics, many of which perhaps never understood Star Wars to begin with, saw the random crap about space and aliens and thought, 'Sure this is what they like'."<br/><br/>I couldn't agree more. This movie left me completely cold, and I didn't think a Star Wars movie was capable of doing that. The worst part is...I don't think there is a way for it to be fixed. Disney has now opened the floodgates for this franchise to be a Transformers or Fast & Furious - just disposable trash, albeit trash that makes a billion dollars at the box office. The biggest disappointment of the year. Fans have a right to be heartbroken and angry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The first one is that the movie spoils the whole series.<br/><br/>First off, Luke Skywalker<br/>•	Why does Luke spend decades moping on an island while the galaxy is going to hell around him?  This is not consistent with the character we saw in Episodes 4, 5, and 6.  Luke Skywalker is not a quitter.  And he doesn’t abandon his family and friends.  If he is supposed to have become this type of person, we should see a strong and plausible explanation for this dramatic shift in his character.<br/>•	The explanation given for Luke’s flight from society is that he almost killed Ben Solo because he was corrupted by Snoke.  This again is NOT Luke’s character.  In his own past, against all odds and all facts staring him in the face, Luke committed himself to rescuing his father from the Dark Side.  And he did it.  He learned that someone even as dark as Darth Vader could be saved.  So as far as we know, the only time Luke ever tried to save someone from the dark side he was able to do so.  Why would he then become so jaded and think he couldn’t save Ben?  It doesn’t make sense.  Moreover, when did Luke Skywalker become a cold-blooded murderer who could kill his own nephew while he slept?<br/><br/>In addition to pooping on Luke, The Last Jedi also fails to deliver on the promises set up in The Force Awakens.<br/>•	Promise:  There is some cool reason why Luke was hidden away for all these years, and why a portion of the map was left in R2D2 so that Luke could still be found.   Reality: No reason.  He’s just a bitter, jaded defeated man moping on an island.<br/>•	Promise:  There is some cool link between Rey, Luke, and Luke’s lightsaber, along with a story of why the lightsaber was there.   Reality: No explanation.  And there’s no connection at all with Rey, she’s just some random force-user who happened to pick up his lightsaber.<br/>•	Promise:  There is something cool with Rey’s parentage.  Reality: Nope, nothing.<br/><br/>Also, character development and characterization are weak in this movie:<br/>•	Rey:  She doesn’t really change in The Last Jedi.  And why is she so powerful with no training?<br/>•	Finn:  If anything, he reverted back to a selfish coward, and had the same arc as in the previous movie, which was getting shamed into helping out the Resistance again.<br/>•	Kylo Ren:  He’s probably the most interesting character, because he does grow.  He decides he doesn’t need his overlord telling him what to do and takes matters into his own hands.  But I'm not sure I even care.<br/>•	Poe:  He has no growth, unless you count mutiny as character growth, but it doesn’t really change him.<br/>•	Snoke:  He created a force bridge connecting Kylo and Rey.  Why?  Why connect his minion with some random force-using woman half a galaxy away?  We know there are plenty other force users in the galaxy, so why did he feel the need to connect these two?  Why does he care?  This seemed like an excuse to connect the two characters, with no reasonable motivation for the character pulling the strings.<br/><br/>The silly side plot...<br/>•	Finn and Rose fly to a casino in another star system to get a code cracker.  And somehow they’re going to convince this guy to come back with them to where the lead ship in the First Order is waiting to destroy the Resistance, and have him go ONTO that ship to help them.  Yeah, that’s plausible.<br/>•	This whole side plot felt like it was invented just to give Finn something to do in this movie.<br/><br/>Some people claim The Last Jedi takes Star Wars into a bold new direction, and people are just complaining because it’s different.  That’s not my complaint at all.  In fact, I welcome change to the Star Wars universe, and I was hoping for something even more different and amazing.  But at the very least, I expected consistent and interesting characters, along with a well-crafted plot that fulfilled promises set forth in The Force Awakens, even as it opened new mysteries or character dilemmas of its own.<br/><br/>Here’s the bottom line for me.  After the original Star Wars, after The Empire Strikes Back, and even after The Force Awakens, I was left wanting more and I couldn’t wait to see the next movie.  After The Last Jedi, I’m not left in anticipation at all, because they’ve left me nothing to look forward to.  Some kid pulls a broomstick to him?  Who cares?  I’m not invested in random people in the galaxy, I want to be invested in the characters on the screen, and the poor characterization in this movie fails to get me there.  Despite the amazing spectacle and the fantastic music leaving me amped up at the end of the movie, I’m ultimately left feeling flat and disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

By extension this movie transformed Star Wars from a story about spiritual warriors seeking a higher truth and defending the galaxy from Luciferian evil to a story about social Justice warriors. All meaning has been sucked out of the myth. The deep religious undertones that made this story so resonant have been replaced with nihilism, post-modernism and cultural Marxism. It is a direct assault on everything this myth stood for for forty years and if Disney thought people were too stupid to notice they were wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I get that the old characters need to make way for the new ones, I just wish they didn't make them look like fools while doing it.<br/>I'm not sure how JJ is going to finish the saga...most of the plot points he set up are dead now.<br/>Save your money, watch it on Netflix.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I personally think it's crazy the people who criticized The Force Awakens for being "too similar to A New Hope" are largely the same people criticizing this movie for being "too different". Anyways, despite some parts being kind of meh, I would be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed this movie greatly and that this is probably one of if not my favorite movie this year. The movie started out alright, and then as it went on it became something amazing. The acting is excellent. I don't think I can pick a favorite actor in this movie. The plot doesn't follow many of the big Star Wars tropes, and I think that's great. There is one or two times where the plot is a little too different, but for the most part it is an intriguing addition to the saga. About half of the big moments in the movie were really predictable, but the other half were pretty good. While I did laugh a lot at every good joke, I feel they went a little overboard with the amount comedy. The characters were very well done in this movie. By the end I truly cared about all of them. Also, can someone give the guy who choreographed all of the fights scenes a raise? Those scenes were incredibly exiting to watch. Unfortunately, many things from Force Awakens didn't seem to matter in this movie, and the loose ends that were tied weren't always brought to a very satisfying conclusion. Overall, this is a very good movie that isn't quite a 10/10 due to the somewhat slow beginning, some things from Force Awakens not having a good payoff, and a few other flaws.<br/><br/>Edit: So, Nostalgia Critic just made a review for this movie, and his verdict is pretty much exactly what I thought of the movie: "It was awesome except for when it was kind of dumb."</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8009345"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The Last Jedi is a rare beast, the kind that excels spectacularly while also being crushingly disappointing. I give credit to the director, Rian Johnson for breaking the decade old Star Wars formula and bringing something fresh and new to the table. However, it's only when you try something new that you hilariously fail. First and foremost, this movie is NOT a failure. However, some choices made in this film are puzzling to say the last. Primarily, the introduction of a new side character, Rose, and a side plot so boring and drab I can't even recall with planet it takes place on (let's refer to it as the casino planet).Rose is one of the most annoying characters I've seen on the silver screen in years, someone who's only purpose seems to be to annoy the audience constantly. Her actions are nonsensical and bog the plot down. Her character can be summed up with her forced kiss with Finn near the end of the story, as well as stopping him from saving the rebellion because "we win this war by saving what we love, not by fighting what we hate". Her accompanying storyline in the Casino planet is a waste of time and honestly feels like it's going nowhere. Moving on, while I do not have a problem with the deaths of Luke and Snoke, I do have a problem with their characterization. Snoke's death is certainly ballsy, however the lack of a backstory and who he was doesn't give the audience any reason to really care. For us, he was a CGI alien that shot lightning out of his fingertips. Finally, the death of Luke Skywalker has been something that has caused controversy for all fans. While I do not have a problem with his death and think his entire ending sequence was done very tastefully, I do not see a reason for him to die. He very well could have stayed alive, and while that would have changed the outcome of the film, it would have allowed for him to become more of a mentor to the next generation of force users as hinted by the end of the film. His death only allows for him to become more of a Yoda figure, something that I fear will cause Episode IX to become eerily similar to Episode VI. Of course, on top of this are an abundance of plot errors (they're not plot holes, but they don't make any sense as to why it happened). More significantly, why Holdo did not notify anybody about her plan regarding the transport pods. On the positive side of things, this film is incredibly well acted, and some of the design choices are truly stunning, especially the fight in Snokes palace where the fire overtakes the room, lighting up the theater, as well as the hyperdrive kamikaze scene, which was truly a jaw dropping moment. It's very well acted, and I'll be honest, the scenes with Luke, Kylo and Rey are so absorbing and interesting that I never wanted it to end. However, anything else immediately dropped my intention and I found it hard to care for anyone that wasn't Kylo, Rey, Luke and maybe Finn. Is it a 0/10? No! a 0/10 would have to be truly an unwatchable piece of garbage which this film most certainly not. Presuming that a 5/10 is average, I'd consider this film to be slightly above average. It could certainly have been tighter, the runtime didn't help. Overall, I'd recommend this movie to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

How could someone make such stupid mistake...<br/><br/>- What was purpose of not telling Poe plan??? Thanks God captain gender studies is dead.<br/><br/>- Luke character development is so wrong from the start... Luke always was the one who kept hope alive. He would never abandon his friends... But The most stupid part was Yoda laughing on destroying Jedi temple...<br/><br/>- Snoke development is fuc*** joke. Let's bait fan then just kill him. So most powerful dark side user die because he wasn't able to read Kylo mind? He was able to make Rey and Kylo mind connected, but he wasn't able to feel that he wanted to kill him - seems legit. We wanted answers - all we got is cut story.<br/><br/>- Rey parrents - well this thread is already dead...<br/><br/>- Kylo dark side development? Forget about it.<br/><br/>- Why Rey is so powerfull? Forget about it.<br/><br/>- How Leia survived in outter space? Forget about it.<br/><br/>- Why First order didn't summon ships in front of resistance?<br/><br/>- Why First Order didn't blockade whole planet?<br/><br/>There is so much plot holes, wrong decission etc. I read about 20 SW books, I have nearly every game that came out.

Going in mostly blind, it was easy to tell that this wasn't done by the same people who did Episode seven. I walked about about two thirds way through the movie and met up with friends who saw it all the way to the end. The movie plays out like a check list of modern day stereotypes rather than the grand science fantasy epic that is Star Wars.<br/><br/>While the movie has some epic quality visuals and some awesome moments the poor story and butchering of already established characters outweighs it. Many opportunities are shunted aside for the sake of one liners and what I can only figure is a ham fisted social justice agenda behind it-- On that note I am most sure that this movie would pass the Bechdel test for what amount of good that is worth.<br/><br/>There are moments of absolute gold quality in this movie and are worthy of being in a Star Wars film, but they are short lived and often followed up with a punchline that doesn't need to be there. If the movie were written by the previous team and directed by Abrams, the movie would have been the epic sequel to Episode 7 as this movie wants to be.<br/><br/>Call me an 'Alt Right Troll' or some kind of Bot, I've been called worse things before. I'm sure plenty would have been upset if rather than the 7th Harry Potter movie we got an adaptation of the Fan Fiction 'My Immortal'.<br/><br/>TL;DR This is a Star Wars film played like a bad social justice fan fiction trying to hit every part of an ideological check list as possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Poor Mark Hamill being handed a **** sandwich after waiting so long to reprise the role. I'm giving it 4 stars as there were a couple of redeeming scenes.

Some good humour,disappointing end, didnt like the Fin/Rose storyline, especially when Fin was 'obsessed' with Rey, but magically forgets her at the end! Pointless 'codebreaker' storyline, ridiculous encounter with Fin and Phasma, which had a shameful ending! Was expecting more from Luke..... No where near as good as the more superior Rogue One, which had, breathtaking scenery,script and actiing; sadly which TLJ does not. Rogue One, then Force Awakens, then TLJ in order of best of the recent three.So gutted, dont know if I will bother rushing to see the others.

I felt compelled to register and leave this review because of the media campaign to pretend that this is a good movie. It isn’t. The writing is very poor, plot holes all over the place, pointless characters (Rose)... in one movie Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy managed to destroy everything good about Star Wars. The treatment of Luke’s character is so poor, so lazily put together, so incoherent, so blatantly disrepectful of the original trilogy... What boggles the mind is how nobody (apart from Mark Hamill, bless his heart) tried to course correct this absolute insult of a movie. This isn’t bad because people “refuse to accept change” or “didn’t get what they wanted” or “have a problem with strong female characters”... this is bad because the writing is absolutely brain-dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The end of the movie is where most of the excitement is but it feels like it goes on forever. Some of the main characters feel like they have literally no reason to be in the film and as a sequel to the previous film in the franchise this film falls fairly flat, choosing to drop most of the ongoing questions and plotlines from Episode VII rather than progress them. On the other hand the film is pretty well directed and shot,  most of the performances are between OK and good and the film is pretty enjoyable, even if the enjoyment is ironic sometimes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The plot is bad and features heavy agenda pushing. Please, don't go to see this film. It will ruin your perception of what the Star Wars is about.<br/><br/>The good things are easy to list: Amazing visual effects, good soundtrack (albeit it heavily borrows from the existing old Star Wars music) and high production values. For those three things I have to give some points on 0 to 10 scale. But everything else is just betrayal of the highest level.<br/><br/>Then there is the bad stuff: Actors are dull and uninteresting. Instead of demonstrating the content of their characters, they've been reduced to nothing but their external appearances. There are absolutely pointless scenes like the space casino thing which accomplishes nothing. The "sacrifices" people make here are utterly pointless and stupid. The film is way too long. And numerous other things other reviews surely will mention but I try to keep this spoiler-free and short.<br/><br/>This and the previous film are utterly non-canon to me. They do not follow the Star Wars Expanded Universe well enough to make me interested. To me Star Wars is dead and Disney killed it. At least I still have my books, comics, games and the original trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If you were expecting for it to propel the story forward at all, you will be extremely disappointed, as it cuts off any sort of story or plot to go on for another sequel.  Episode IX is completely f**ked in this regard.  Here are some reasons why... WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!  Rian Johnson kills off Snoke as if he's a little **** after making him out to be powerful as all hell. They kill off Luke by having him fade away (the most fighting he did was a stick fight with Rey, which he f**king loses!). Captain Phasma was killed by Finn after a 20 second fight with him thanks to the power of ex-machinas.    Leia does NOT die, instead she has a force ex-machina moment and Mary Poppins herself to safety after being blown up into the vacuum of space.  Rey is still terrible, taking literally no training whatsoever to be able to do remarkable sh** that even Anakin couldn't do at his early stages, even after Rey's parents are revealed to be nobody junkers that left her behind out of greed.<br/><br/>Another major disappointment was Leia's character as a whole.  She doesn't get much screen time, and when she does it's weak, and ultimately pointless.  She feels so much like a side character that she could've been removed altogether (which she should have been), and it wouldn't have made a goddamn difference to the story.  Being yet another reason why Episode IX is royally f**ked, you know, having to figure  out how to either sustain her or kill her off.<br/><br/>The one decent thing I can say for this movie is that it's very pretty.  It is hands down the most aesthetically pleasing Star Wars movie to date, but that doesn't help a film much when the story, characters, and even the ending are terrible.<br/><br/>The Last Jedi takes everything The Force Awakens built up and says, "F**k it, we don't need it."  Being a terrible segway episode and standalone episode.  But at least it did it while being pretty, which is the only reason this film is a 3/10 as opposed to a flat out 0/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

No recomiendo ir a verla es tirar el dinero y salir disgustado.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

No explanation on who he was, what he wanted. Oh well. Flying granny scene was .... I think pathetic is the right word. In the middle, when Rey and Kylo were connecting I really thought something special was going to happen. Either them switching sides of the force, evil Rey, good Kylo. Or them somehow reshaping the force into some new order... Maybe even bringing good and evil together through love. nah, R is good,K is evil. Boooring.<br/>Curly hair guy, his story arch was pointless, I don’t remember his name. Purple hair lady was a god awful leader and I’m glad she’s dead (also don’t remember her name).<br/>Finn sadly got stuck into another pointless story arch with that annoying, unimportant, tertiary character, Rose. I do remember her name just because of how incredibly shallow her character was. She RUINED his heroic suicide and then told him she loved him just before dying.... Like he met you not even a day ago you **** weirdo. GROSS. Special effects were top notch, even if some things were really out of place. Like those weird penguins and the red salt lake.<br/>I did love the scene where ray touches the rock at the bottom of the island though. I Probably won’t go to watch the next one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8007186"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I am not a fanboy. I do not want to MAGA. I do not suffer from “toxic masculinity.” I am, however, a lifelong fan of Star Wars. I also want to see fantasy movies to, you know, engage in fantasy, not be reminded of modern life’s ills. Unfortunately, TLJ is thinly-veiled allegory for American politics that pushes a SJW agenda. It also plagiarizes The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and has absurd plot holes. Allegory and the SJWs:<br/>* All the bad guys are white guys (except a few quisling Asians and the female silver Stormtrooper, who is in costume). No major protagonists are white guys, except Luke, who is surly and unlikeable and gets killed off at the end. *Men - both the good guys and bad guys - are depicted as irrational, emotional, and childish. The First Order rules the universe, but all of its officers are seemingly incompetents who throw a fit whenever things don’t go their way. How is that?<br/>*Women, on the other hand, are depicted as noble, calm, and mature. Women occupy all positions of leadership in the Resistance (with the exception of some token aliens). There are no men on the bridge of the rebel flagship. *There are no white male protagonists in the first two installments of this trilogy. So far, the protagonists are: white female, black male, Latino male, and Asian female; apparently, white males can only portray the bad guys.  Of the three holdovers from the original trilogy - Luke, Leaia, and Han - the two white males have been killed off. *As the hero of an epic, Rey is supposed to undergo The Hero’s Journey. Unfortunately, she does not, because to do so would require that she encounter setbacks and temporary failures before succeeding. This, of course, would be misogynistic, because it would depict women as weak. Therefore, as other reviews have more eloquently noted, Rey displays no weakness. She flies the Millennium Falcon better than Han Solo. She experiences no moments of self-doubt. Her only “journey” is to know the limits of her seemingly limitless power. Girl Power, indeed. *Capitalism is bad. War is bad. Racing animals is bad. Eating animals is bad. Love conquers all. Plagiarism and Plot Holes<br/>* Two key scenes shamelessly plagiarize Empire and Jedi. Lucas was excoriated for plagiarizing scenes from other movies for the middle three movies. It looks like Johnson isn’t above a little plagiarism himself. I was waiting for a Tauntaun to show up in the final scene. *Most absurd of all is the whole premise of the movie. The First Order has figured out how to track the Resistance through hyperspace, so the Resistance leads them on a low-speed chase through space with shields on full in the rear until they can figure out how to jam their signal and escape through hyperspace again. Are you kidding me? The entire premise of the movie is...the OJ Simpson White Bronco chase? The First Order can figure out how to track the rebels through hyperspace, but they can’t figure out how to pass them and shoot them from the front of their ships? Really? I know movies require some suspension of disbelief, but give me a break, people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It wouldn’t cost all that much to get a writer to come up with something new. But I guess not, so cue The Last Jedi, a mash-up of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.<br/><br/>I can’t see how this is being touted as the best Star Wars ever. It was ok, even good in places, but not really great at all. And please please Hollywood, enough with the pale English baddies and the multiple endings.<br/><br/>Also Disney, there’s this thing movie makers like to do, it’s called editing. You chop out the padding that perhaps the director is in love with, but isn’t necessary to move the story forward or round out the characters. However, what The Last Jedi did give us was the performance we all sort of knew Mark Hamill was capable of. Just as Harrison Ford carried The Force Awakens, Hamill was the jewel in the crown here. Well done Mark, and well-done Disney for bringing Luke back.<br/><br/>So because fanboys love to rank these films, I’d say The Last Jedi is number four in the pecking order, below Empire, A New Hope, and Awakens, but better than all the rest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Enjoying the fun visuals, but having no idea what they are even going to do in Episode 9 with no actual remaining conflict besides Rey and Kylo flying around for a movie before they have a battle? What kind of terrible writing do you have to do to kill off all the interesting characters, character assassinate the other interesting ones and then end the movie with no where to go? Boring boring boring boring. No rewatches required. This made JJ's Episode 7 look like a solid 8-9/10 and the prequels actually worth rewatching. Garbage. Burn it with fire.

Little did I know that I would be walking out of the theater in such disappointment. I couldn't believe it! This film did not deliver the same experience The Force Awakens provided. It felt like it was a tree whose core was rotten. It lacked something. A lot of something. It looked and sounded like Star Wars but it didn't feel like Star Wars. It felt poorly written with no clear direction. Many of my favorite characters had been completely mischaracterized. I could care less for any of the characters. There were so many moments where I found myself being ripped away from the movie and I realized I was sitting in a movie theater. Having to listen to a political lecture really took me out of the experience. I want to forget about life hear on earth and go on a magical journey and see people do impossible and amazing things. This movie was very disappointing and unsatisfying. There were many questions from The Force Awakens that weren't even addressed. The answers we did get were very underwhelming. I have very little hope for the next installment. We'll see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
