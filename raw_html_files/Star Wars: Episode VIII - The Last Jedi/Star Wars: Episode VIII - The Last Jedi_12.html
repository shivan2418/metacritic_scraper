Characters with outstanding chemistry and potential such as Finn and Rey, and arguably the most iconic protagonist of all time, Luke Skywalker, are all at the short end when The Last Jedi decides to break with their established past victories and struggles. Outstanding performances by Mark Hamill, Oscar Isaac and the late Carrie Fisher are not enough to withstand the whiplash of this film being an immediate sequel to The Force Awakens. Despite Johnson's stunning visuals and the incredible efforts of the creatures department have to show for this movie, the writing lacks the spark this saga is known for, and sets a difficult act for J.J. Abrams to follow (and fix).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

"Rebels" are still fleeing from an inexplicably powerful first order, its just a couple less now.<br/><br/>To sum up my impression of the movie: Propably better than the christmas special. Propably.<br/><br/>For those with the patience to read more, this is a list of the points that make the movie such a disaster, in no particular order.<br/><br/>1. The timing.<br/>Episode VII ends with Kylo Ren heavily wounded by a bowcaster and a light sabre. Snoke ordered to have him brought to him to finish his training. Also the ultimate weapon of the first order has been destroyed.<br/>Propably about half a day later he is fully healed and shows up with a complete fleet, including a not-quite-ultimate battleship at the resistance HQ. Or maybe the resistance was stupid enough to not immediately initiate their GTFO protocols. I'm not sure which would be worse.<br/>Well either way, at this point in time the first order has taken control of the galaxy. Yes, the whole galaxy that was pretty free under the protection of the republican fleet a day ago. There are 200 billion suns in our own galaxy, and the first order took control over that amount of systems instantly. Palpatine did that by using an existing power structure that had grown over millenia, and the first order does it by conquest in a snap. There is no way to properly descripe how incredibly stupid this is. If the first order is that powerful, how did the republic ever stop them? How do you fight somebody who, after losing that bs Starkiller base still has the means to do THAT??<br/>2. Apparently you can use your hyperdrive to cut right through a vastly larger object with your ship. This of course means that any superweapon could have been easily destroyed by a rusty freighter flown by remote. This alone makes the first order and its fleet of unneccessarily costlly and huge ships a non-issue for anyone with a brain. Sadly nobody in the entire movie has one, or they would have done that with one of the two ships they were abandoning anyway. After all, how would the First Order prevent it? Destroy it? Apparently they can't at that distance. Evade? With a ship broader than the Executor was long??<br/>3. Luke Skywalker. This is NOT Mark Hamills fault in any way. He was turned from the incarnation of Hope, someone who thought redeeming Darth Vader was worth a shot, into a nihilistic grouch hiding on an island somewhere in the galaxy. Seriously, its only the empire returning in a more Nazi fashion and his sister fighting for freedom and her life. Who cares, right? It doesn't matter anyway. Also for some reason he thought about killing a teenager in his sleep for having dark thoughts - which is, of course, absolutely irredeemable. Apparently dropping an unstable stone hut on him is so much power he has to hide 'till his death. Oh and he was finished off so his iconic figure doesn't stand in the way of whatever they come up with for IX. Apparently death by meditating is a thing now.<br/>4. Physics. No, really.<br/>The movie opens up with a battleship being attacked by bombers of the resistance. Which would be no problem - except for the bombers having WWII style bomb bays. What is supposed to drag them out of there and toward the target? There is NO gravity in space. (Not completely true, since that was in orbit, but the effective force of the gravity is zero, or everything would crash on the planet). Even worse, each bomber had about 500 of those bombs. The hell is that supposed to do? The first dozen bombs will explode and either push those coming after them away or outright making them explode outside the target doing nothing at all. And the bombers were HUGE targets. Get a squadron of B-Wings instead. Those are bombers that make sense. Well, anyway, the one bomber that made it blew up that multiple km ship. Apparently hitting it anywhere will cause a chainreaction blowing it up or something.<br/>Snokes flagship also doesn't seem to know there is no gravity in space, because its oversized turbolaser shots arc like artillery shells would on a planet.<br/>5. Hyperspace tracking.<br/>Well, this is not so stupid from a technical point, but massively retarded from a story perspective. Because you see there is a... story arc about only the flagship doing the tracking. But the flagship wasn't there when the rebels fled. So it isn't necessary to track at the starting point. So... hit&run, with X-Wings or otherwise, doesn't work anymore. Any ship approaching a secret rebel base would instantly betray its location. There are only two possibilities for any further movie.<br/><br/>I'm only stopping now is because I'm running out of characters. Thats how bad VIII is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Snoke is killed early on without any indication of WHO he was and HOW he was able to build the First Order out of the remains of the empire.  Rey's parents are dismissed as drunks who abandoned her.  Rey also somehow forgets that Ren murdered his own father and starts to fall for him because he has dreamy pectoral muscles.  Luke is a grouchy old man who "ran away" and refuses to help.  Rey masters the force in like 1 day and overpowers Luke.  The resistance is a pathetic bunch who can't seem to get anything right.  The entire plot is a low speed chase scene through space where nothing happens.  Story aside though, Rian Johnson makes several changes to the way things work in the Star Wars universe.  Ships now run out of fuel.  The force is mastered (by Rey) in like 1 day. Hyperspace ships can somehow interact with other non-hyperspace ships (this has never been the case before).  Laser bullets "arc" like artillery shells.  Bombs "drop" in space, and the list goes on.<br/><br/>Additionally, for a movie with a running time of 2.5 hours, nothing really happens to advance the story and by the end of the movie you're left wondering "What did I just watch?"<br/><br/>Save yourself the money and do not see this movie.  Maybe go watch the original 3 again instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8029759"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I created this account especially to write a review here and share my sad experience with The Last Jedi movie. I'm a teen. Yes, I'm new generation and I had never see a Star Wars movie before. My parents and two older brothers, and also uncles, aunts and cousins, most of them just love Star Wars. So I always wanted to watch these movies and figure out for myself what is so special about them. But it didn't happen until my friend called me and say: "let's see the new Star Wars on the movie theater". And I say: "Yeah". I was so hesited to finally watch a Star Wars! I was going finally to understand why so many people in the whole world take this saga almost as a religion, a lifestyle or so, why it's so important to them, even influencing their own lives. Then we went to the movies and most of time I was thinking: "So this is it? That's the great Star Wars?" When I looked at my friend she was just more interested in eating her popcorn than  understanding the movie! When I left the theater I said to her: "What a pointless buch of scrap!" I came home and said: "Sorry dad, sorry mum but Star Wars sucks!". They knew I was going to the movies but they didn't know wich movie I was going to see and so I saw the shock on their faces and they asked me if I was talking about The Last Jedi and I said "yes" and they looked at me with sad eyes and then my dad said: "honey, this is not Star Wars. This crap you saw is only a Disney attempt to destroy our dreams in order to make more money, because they believe that every boy and girl of your generation is stupid to be fooled by this fake Disney Wars". He was so serious that I have all of his words on my head until now and it happened three days ago. My uncle has the entire collection of six original movies of Star Wars in Blu Ray. He lent them to me, so I could see the true Star Wars. So, I picked up the first one The Phantom Manace and watched it. I just loved it! It has an intriguing story and attractive characters like Qui Gon, Obi Wan, Queen Amidala (I adore her!), a misterious villain and another that I found really scary, Darth Maul. He looked like the devil himself! And that little cute boy. OMG! I fell in love with him and I got very interested in what's the big question about him. Who was he? Why was he so special and talented? He've got some powers and I understood that the story of Star Wars was basically about him. The second movie, Attack of the Clones, I loved it even more,and the whole story is far more than just entertaining. The little boy grew into a rebel teenager and he is in love with the senator Amidala and then he loses his mother. At the same time there are many other interesting things going on in the movie, with Obi Wan investigating the bount hunter and... Jedi council, the battles... Everything about the movie is so enjoyeble, and the third one, Revenge of the sith, a sad and touching movie, I cried watching many of its scenes. Good acting, wonderful story, that matches perfectly witn the fourth one, A New Hope that comes and also explains everything. This movie actually brings a new hope as we Ani's twins grew up and fight against the Empire and the real devil of the saga, Darth Sidious. Then it comes the fifth The Empire Strikes back and more emotions come with it. We see Yoda again and the  "No, I am your Father" scene. I cried again and I wished from the botton of my heart that Luke could bring his father to the good side again. And that's what he does in the sixth and last (yes, last) movie of the saga Return of the jedi! It's complete and perfect. I also liked Jar Jar and the Ewoks (my parents are not exactly their fans). And I was really wanting to see all the six movies again! That didn't happen with the garbage I saw in the movie theater! So, the young guy who firmly believed his father could be saved and turned to the good side again is the same old master that considered to kill his nephew? Ok. His father was already in the dark side for more than 20 years, and even so he didn't want to kill him! But the boy was not even in the dark side yet and he was going to assassinate him and cowardly, when he was sleeping???? No! This is not the same character, this is not the same saga. I understand why my parents, uncles, cousins and many friends are so sad. Disney is really ruining a wonderful franchise. But for me only the six wonderful movies count and I'll be always happilly watching them on and on and on. The rest, as my dad said, is Disney Wars, not Star Wars at all. Disney almost made me think that Star Wars was nothing but garbage. And I'm happy to figure out that it's not because the eps 1-6 together make the most emotional and well written story that I've ever see or read in my entire (and still short) life. Period.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie consists of three main storylines and two of those are 100% artificial and would not have happened if certain characters acted in a logical way. It felt like they just existed to give character stuff to do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, you really experience the lack of a common thread for this sequel trilogy of Star Wars. Apparently, the writers/director did not plan out major plot points in advance and loose story ends from the previous movie are mostly ditched. In addition, some characters have a different personality than before and no visible arc throughout the film.<br/><br/>I would give 'The Last Jedi' zero points but admittedly the visuals are great and the score from John Williams is top-notch as always. Nevertheless, terrible Sci-Fi movie and even worse Star Wars film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

No movies are. But for me, this receives the highest rating for how it made me feel, especially after multiple viewings.<br/>The tone of the film is one that I personally like, with the darkness and despair, mixed with a bit of hope. The plot subversions, with Snoke and Rey's parentage, were a welcome breath of fresh air, compared to the Mystery Boxes presented by JJ Abrams in The Force Awakens. Getting into it, Snoke was just as mysterious as the Emperor on the OT, but people years on didn't harp on the fact that we weren't given his back story. Why make a deal of it now? And to have Rey come from nothing gives greater weight to her accomplishments and the gravity of her power.<br/>Finally, I would say that how Luke was portrayed was absolutely amazing. Us, as an audience, we were stuck in a time bubble from just after Episode VI, and even some with the EU that is now NOT canon. We might have seen some growth from the OT characters, but it wasn't the way we expected. And to see the growth go in the opposite direction from our expectations shouldn't make us mad and rant and rage. It should make us ponder and question and visualize the life that Luke lived to have come to such a point in his life. His struggle and trials probably mimic ours in this life more than people realize, aside from the whole Mystic-Force-Space-Opera side of it. He is more real now than he has ever been, and that makes him wonderful and relatable. Flaws and triumphs come together wonderfully to make this film the best I have ever seen, and makes it unbearable to wait to actually own it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In my initial showing, I felt as though there were a lot of misplaced ambitions as subplots from Episode VII were gutted left and right. However, contrasting VII's theme of "awakening", I now see that this was a story of failure. A true drama, casting off all ambition and expectation in its telling. While I definitely don't believe everything was executed masterfully, it does serve to cement the cast's role in a new and greater story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Everything about this movie was incredible, aside from minor issues. Every performance, the multiple extremely engaging plot points and insanely awesome character arcs and bonds, the ridiculously amazing fight scenes and chase scenes with the most stunning CGI, the humour and general Star Wars banter between characters and the creatures within the galaxy, the as-ever intense battle between the First Order and the rebels... usually I go in depth when reviweing a film, but the 5000 character limit holds me back. The only thing which I think they could've handled better was the way they scripted Finn, as I was kind of disappointed at the way his storyline ended. 100% go and see this film, regardless of whether you know what Star Wars is or not.

This is not a bad movie from a movie making point of view (although it looks and feels more like a Marvel movie) but story wise it is plain bad. Terrible story decisions, it drags a lot during the middle with a subplot that does absolutely NOTHING to the story and goes on for about 40 minutes, lots of plotholes, zero character development. Revenge of the Sith is a much, much better movie.

I'm no expert, but I believe your blood boils at around two minutes of exposure. Then go on to bombs dropping in space and finally end at the arcing turbolaser blasts in space. Just disregard seven prior movies and go with that.<br/><br/>Apparently Luke and Anakin wasted a ton of time training to become powerful Jedi. Rey just pulls it out of thin air and becomes more powerful than Luke and Kylo, despite their life-long training. The entire Finn/Rose plot was a waste of time, serving only to put the pro PETA, anti-war (in Star WARS), and anti-capitalist brainwashing of the left.<br/><br/>It destroyed any story arc from TFA and any previous movies. Every reason to come back and watch episode eight was a complete waste and this movie leaves no reason to come see nine. They made the First Order a joke... literally. Kylo is an emo preteen while Hux is a source of entertainment. Phasma was a complete waste and easily killed by the janitor. There is just no threat from the FO anymore. You KNOW Rey will just come melt faces, so what's the point?<br/><br/>BB8 can take out squads of soldiers alone and pilot an AT-ST. Poe was just a joke through the entire film. He actually would have been better served not being in the movie at all. Luke was not the Luke that was developed over a trilogy, countless books and comics, and tens of games developed as canon by LA. Why didn't he go to the salt planet? He died anyway.... it was so useless.<br/><br/>As useless as the juvenile attempt at humor. Star Wars traditionally had some silliness in the movies, but not a fart joke every three minutes. You just cannot take this movie seriously and can't enjoy it. It alone has destroyed my faith in Disney to stay true to the franchise. I enjoyed TFA and loved Rogue One, but after this, I see they are sacrificing everything that made Star Wars what it was to push radical politics and make a quick cash-grab.  It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't give this hack director (who was solely responsible for this mess of a story) his own trilogy!  He quite clearly does not know how to write or direct Star Wars, and judging by this, shouldn't even write or direct a television commercial.<br/><br/>Avoid this movie and disregard Disney's decree to wipe most of the Star Wars canon if you even liked the franchise a little. You have eight good movies and a ton of books, comics, and games that are both cannon directly from Lucasarts and EU. Avoid this movie if you are even a casual fan of any type of entertainment and don't feel like wasting your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8027595"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I want to write a review because I enjoyed the movie a lot, as did almost all the critics, yet apparently the average reviewer here did not. I'm surprised by this. There are a lot of flaws with the movie, and there are plenty of reviews telling you all about them. I won't repeat those points here, though I agree with most of the complaints made. However, the movie also did a few essential things very well. For me TLJ was a great movie, far better than TFA and R1: films with fewer flaws that also did very little to advance the franchise. TLJ felt like a breathe of fresh air into a franchise at risk of quickly becoming stale. The main characters (Rey, Kylo, Luke, Poe, basically all of them except Finn) were developed in interesting and compelling ways. Kylo has really grown on me as a villain: in TFA he's a slightly cheesy Darth Vader-light; now, I've realized that his ambiguities make him a rich character to explore and adds uncertainty to the series. And Adam Driver did a great job; I didn't expect him to be the one to carry the movie. Really, the whole Rey-Kylo sub-plot was great, thankfully so because that should be (and is) the heart of the trilogy. It's a slight let-down to see Snoke built up as an antagonist, only to see him killed him off almost as soon as he was introduced. I also think it was a great decision to do so. It had the shock factor, where suddenly our expectations are turned upside down. It added the element of genuine suspense: having no idea what's going to happen next but being glued to your seat to find out. And it allowed Kylo to come into his own as a character, seeing how he reacted to his new role.<br/><br/>Adding to that same crucial element of suspense was hows both Poe's mutiny and Finn's mission failed. Admiral Holdo seemed like a bad guy--until she turned out to be the hero. These added an element of realism (though the plot was implausibly thin in other places) and uncertainty: not everything turns out as hoped for the good guys. It also makes for interesting characters--I thought Poe had a nice character arc. In TLJ, we see the Force used in ways we didn't know were possible until now. We also see hyperspace used as a weapon. These decisions have been talked about at length. But I loved it. Especially Kylo and Rey's "facetime" conversations. I find it far better than the opposite situation: where everything about the Star Wars universe and its Force underpinnings is set in stone with no room to be explored further. In summary, there are flaws e.g. with many plot choices, bad humor, and the pacing. But the movie does a great job with developing the characters and evolving the franchise to new ground. I think the movie will be judged better in hindsight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Disney should have released this parody on April 1st. There are over 82,000 signatures on a change.org petition to remove TLJ from Star Wars canon as of 1/6/18. Disney won't do that, but that there is a petition at all conveys that something is wrong here. And something is. Aside from being a bad movie, TLJ refutes the values of Star Wars. Disney pretends complaints show how sophisticated TLJ is. Those dumb fans, they don't 'get it'. But last I checked, thin characterization, using characters simply as vehicles for action, inconsistency within a trilogy, and thinking ships need fuel in space to keep moving, were not signs of sophistication. The discrepancy with pro reviews may be explained by the fact that pros' publications receive Disney advertising dollars. I give TLJ a 1 for the actors. They are not to blame. But the writing is ruinous to the entire franchise.<br/><br/><br/>First, too much CGI, visually messy scenes. The movie had no idea what to do with Finn. The casino planet scene was filler. And how is it possible, after destroying Starkiller Base, that massive weapon, that the First Order seconds later has all but vanquished the Resistance? There's no gap between VII and VIII. (There was a gap of 3 years between ANH and The Empire Strikes Back.) So why is the First Order in such top form after such a huge defeat at the hands of the Resistance (now inexplicably called the Rebellion). It's like the Resistance's accomplishments of the last movie accomplished nothing at all. By the way, I'm not a bot. And I'm also not alt right or a Trump supporter. I'm white, married to a brown woman of African descent (she was not born in the USA and her first language is not English). We have a young daughter who loves BB8, R2D2, Rey, and light sabers. But that's based on TFA. We wouldn't allow her to watch TLJ any more than we'd let her watch Sesame Street themed porn.<br/><br/><br/>The biggest problems with TLJ were Luke's characterization, the lack of characterization of Rey, and the anti-Star Wars theme which rendered this not Star Wars, but Mirror Universe Star Wars, or Bizarro Star Wars.<br/><br/><br/>Regarding Rey, if you think her TFA "vision" had meaning, or there was any rhyme or reason to Maz Kanata saying to Rey, "Now it calls out to you" (referring to Darth Vader's and Luke's light saber)  you will be disappointed. IT IS ALL DROPPED. The identity of Rey's parents might have helped explain why she's so great at everything, but this was squandered. This is not a sequel, it is not act 2, it has almost nothing to do with TFA. Ep 2 continued Ep 1; 5 continued 4; but Ep 8 spits on Ep 7. The idea that Rey could beat Luke (trained by two Jedi masters) in a fight is ludicrous to the Nth degree, especially when you consider how much training Luke (not to mention Anakin) required. Luke lost his hand to Vader because, while he trained under Yoda, he left too early. He paid a price. Rey pays no price. She's perfect without education beyond a two minute meditation session. A protagonist so strong is not credible, and is boring because nothing can threaten her, thus no suspense. Johnson knows this; it's why the last act shifts and all but abandons Rey; there is no peril for Rey now that she's superwoman. He's left JJ with nothing for Ep. IX. As for Luke, this was anti-Luke. Luke was aware Vader had killed millions, yet in Return of the Jedi, refused to kill him. So Luke's instinct to kill Ben in TLJ wasn't in keeping with Luke's character. And would Luke abandon his cause, and his SISTER, for decades, to hide out? No. But if so, why did he leave a clue to his whereabouts for people to follow? He was searching for the first jedi temple why? No reason at all. Rian Johnson wasn't consistent with the original films or Force Awakens. TLJ is hermetically sealed off from and doesn't fit with the saga. It takes place in a separate universe. The statements throughout TLJ that heroism and sacrifice are not positive values, that there is no difference between good and bad, are anti-Star Wars. They also deny TFA, not to mention the intense sacrifices of Rogue One that made everyone's lives in TLJ possible. Bottom line. TLJ is creepy and nihilistic.<br/><br/>Being pro-women is great. But Poe sexist, when Mon Mothma led the Rebels for 4 movies and then Leia led them, is absurd. Making every man bumbling, evil, or arrogant is hard to miss. You don't have to tear men down in order to build women up. That is just what feminists are always publicly claiming they are NOT about. Finally, the dialogue has no personality. In TFA when Finn helps Rey on the Falcon just before Han shows up - has more personality than in all of TLJ. I just bought Thrawn book 1 for an alternative post-Episode VI saga that makes sense. Disney has the legal right to make canon but that's an empty right when there is no spirit behind it. I'll decide what I consider canon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are about three different stories going on, that wouldn't be sufficient on their own, with Rey's jedi training, the empire looking to wipe out the rebels once and for all, and some girl who is a big fan of Finn "convincing" him to join her in a crazy coup attempt. The three sort of crutch each other and tie the plot together fine in the end. The movie does drag on, though, with Rey chasing Luke around for a while, trying to persuade Ren to join the rebels (not gonna happen), and trying to find the "master codebreaker" (I don't remember what they call him). That whole island detour is a little unnecessary... The ending scenes also seem somewhat unnecessary, but maybe they'll be put into perspective later on. The stopped suicide attempt seems a little unnecessary (though I do like Finn), especially if this is meant to introduce love drama (Finn, the girl, Rey, Poe...). Overall, a worthwhile watch for Star Wars fans, though they may be the most disappointed. For a non-fan, this is not a good standalone film. As far as comparisons to The Force Awakens, it's probably not so good, but not by much. That parallel storyline in TFA is somewhat annoying, whereas with this one, it's fresher and slightly more difficult to predict.<br/>GRADE: B</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I should be clear that I'm a lifelong fan of the series, but I make an honest effort to not be myopic about it.<br/><br/>Both directors of the new trilogy are huge SW fans, each with a different mission as filmmakers within the series and each with their own sense of style and vision. Compared to Abrams, whose job it was to create new and likeable characters while thrusting them into a fun and familiar Star Wars setting (a job well done IMO), Johnson's job was to continue the arcs of those characters while somehow subverting expectations. I can't speak for other fans, but I had a strong personal need for the saga to expand on its ongoing narratives, themes and character dimensions in ways that were simultaneously new, familiar, interesting and unpredictable. I didn't want just another Empire the way we kinda got just another New Hope. I knew that to do that Johnson would need to take some risks, and as it turns out he took a lot of them with varying degrees of success. Not everything lands how it should've, but all the A-plot stuff with Kylo, Rey, Luke and Leia worked great for me initially and in retrospect.<br/><br/>Without going into too much detail, VIII suffered mostly from one or two of its subplots, namely that of Finn, Rose and DJ. In spite of their subplot's flaws, perhaps the biggest payoff was one in which DJ helps Finn and Rose to understand that war is far more grey and nuanced than they previously realized, and that the concepts of good and evil are maybe a bit more relative than they'd like to think. This is a concept that is echoed in various ways throughout the movie's various arcs, and its a theme I personally adore, but I wish Finn and Rose had come across it in a more fun and concise way.<br/><br/>One of the most common complaints I've seen of this film has to do with it's attempts at humor. Admittedly, I was caught off guard by it near the beginning, but I quickly and effortlessly found myself enjoying it, and did so for the most part for the rest of the film. I'm not sure I understand why the humor didn't land for so many people, at least not beyond the fact that humor is a very subjective construct. The humor of the prequels suffered greatly because it was so infantile and kid-centric. I think people forget how much humor there was in the original trilogy, but it seems to me that the new trilogy hasn't forgotten, nor has it failed to understand what made that humor more successful. The humor simply needs to appeal to the widest possible audience, younglings and oldlings alike. Was some of the humor too “meta” in this film? Who knows. One could easily argue yes or no, but I personally didn't think the humor was specific enough to be truly bad in a meta sense. Overall it seemed fine, and a lot of it got genuine laughs out of me.<br/><br/>I have enormous difficulty taking seriously the opinions of those who say flat out that Episode VIII “sucks” or even of those who somehow loved it unconditionally, although there seem to be far fewer of those in the latter category. Either way, let's not kid ourselves into thinking there has ever been a perfect SW film (although Empire was objectively maybe the closest we'll ever get to one). Empire took plenty of risks that in hindsight paid off beautifully, and I feel quite comfortable saying the same of VIII. As far as risks go, the difference between the two films is that VIII takes maybe one or two too many. Its possible that a few more months in the writer's room probably could have fixed all or most of the film's biggest missteps, but as a realist I understand time isn't always as abundant as we'd like it to be. In the end, The Last Jedi is what it is, and it would have been folly to ever think it could have pleased everyone.<br/><br/>I could follow suit with so many of the Internet's talking heads by nitpicking this film to death, but doing that seems unnecessary and beside the point of cinema. It might be a cynical view, but I think a lot of people kinda enjoy dissecting all the “bad” parts of movies more than losing themselves in all the “good” parts. I simply can't find it within myself to cut off this film's face to spite it's nose like so many people have. When considering the poignantly grey themes of The Last Jedi, doesn't it make more sense to embrace a more “grey” approach to how we experience films? To reference a specific quote from VIII, if darkness rises, shouldn't the light rise to meet it?<br/><br/>With all it's jaw-dropping spectacles, touching character moments and fresh thought-provoking themes, its the sum of Episode VIII's parts that, for me, make it an enjoyable cinematic experience. I have no quibbles about recommending this episode of Star Wars, but I'd try to ignore the Internet's echo chambers. SW is a movie, not a religion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Visually impeccable, with a cast of very good actors, (Luke and Leia) really exceptional. Too bad that the story seems to be written by a child of 5 years, enormous ingenuity, unforgivable omissions, and above all very little respect for the iconic figures of the past, which are literally killed badly. Some scenes like the "flight" of Leia and the absurd death of Snoke, and the absurd rescue of Finn by Rose, are horrible and cinematically unwatchable. A pity, all this material in the hands of a more capable director (for example Abrams himself) could really make sparks !!! At this point, all that remains is to seriously pray that Abrams in episode 9 will return to more obscure and epic tones for a finale that brings back decency and luster to such an important series. And, please, stop with the bubbly humor and jokes worthy of the worst comic film. Star wars is not Space Balls.

I'm not going to waste (too much) time rehashing what 62,984,825 true fans have already iterated across Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, etc. but I do want to mention that I personally found this film to be an overt assault on: STAR WARS fans, Men, Family, Tradition, Religion, The aged, Capitalism, My eyes/ears, My intelligence, and on George Lucas/Ben Burtt/Mark Hamill, etc.<br/><br/>Not only is this post-postmodern pile of garbage offensive in its caustic/nihilistic sensibilities, it is also devoid of the high-quality STAR WARS craftsmanship we've come to know and love. THE LAST JEDI is a poorly put-together film. Strictly speaking, on the technical side of things, it's crappy. Perhaps we all could have tolerated the aforementioned hyper-political misandrous hate-fest, if the film had exhibited just a lick of cinematic prowess -- but alas!<br/><br/>I'm genuinely struggling to write one good thing about THE LAST JEDI... oh, John Williams!<br/><br/>John Williams' score was solid, and it stands on it's own, thank God. That's why I gave this film 1/10, instead of 0/10. Williams is the man, too bad he got pimped out to this drivel. I found the sound design to be coarse and jarring - where the heck is Ben Burtt? Are you aware that even he doesn't know why he was axed? No Ben Burtt = Red flag #47. The story was nothing, the dialog and humor atrocious, no character development. Rian Johnson destroyed all of Abrams' hard-earned potential and mystery, in one overlong bloated hyper-messy mash. Shameful. Really! I found the "special effects" totally ho-hum. Been there, done that. The explosions were all cut-and-paste pixelation nightmares. This was way worse than Michael Bay's latest Transformers film, and I couldn't stand that one -- at least Bay's special effects are special. Plot holes, ridiculous physics, canonic inconsistencies (to the absurd) -- this film's got it all.<br/><br/>STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI. Gross + hollow; everything about it. Hated it. Could not have been more disappointed...<br/><br/>STAR WARS is supposed to be FUN. Thank you Rian Johnson (and whomever else pulled this crap lever) for infusing politics into "our beloved STAR WARS." In this polarized political climate we find ourselves in today, you could (and should) have taken the high road, and been the ONE thing that brought everyone together. "Everyone loves STAR WARS!" That used to be a thing people would say, it was bi-partisan/universal. Not anymore. You ruined it, and multiplied this present darkness exponentially. Very divisive move, Disney. You sold out to your crap politics, and alienated AT LEAST half of the STAR WARS fan-base.<br/><br/>I didn't make this political. You did. So I'll go there, just real quick... The caustic ideologies present in THE LAST JEDI are likely the same ideologies which were major contributing factors to Trump's 2016 victory. This ram-it-down-your-throat, take-no-prisoners, no compromise, no apologies approach is only going to continue to empower the growing backlash against the ideologies of the left (socialism, rabid/hateful feminism, moral relativism; just to name a few of the bigger/uglier ones). I believe there is a strong correlation between Trump supporters and THE LAST JEDI haters. Not a perfect correlation, by any means, but I think there's a trend there, for sure. This continued "double down on your failures" approach, from the left, will probably lead to a second term for Trump. Yes, THE LAST JEDI may very well help Trump win a second term. That's how bad THE LAST JEDI is. LOL. Just kidding. (I'm trying to be partisan here!) My heart goes out to all the others like me who were actually devastated by this release. I was pleased to see I wasn't alone. I'd never been let down like this before (film-wise). Thank God it's only a movie (and not canon, in my world). Timothy Zahn forever. May the (pre-Disney) Force be with you. (i'm not-a-bot) P.S. This would be a pretty awesome bot entry. Let me know if you know of any bots who could pull this off -- I'd love an introduction. LOL.

I really enjoyed the Force Awakens and how they neatly relaunched the franchise in the modern era by revisiting the New Hope plot elements (people criticized it, but I found it clever and well executed like Terminator 2).  I thought it a great way to honor the original stories while setting up to send us into exciting new territory in the middle movie.  Rian Johnson took all of the FA plot lines/setup plus the remaining characters (Luke and Leia) as well as the history and myths of the Star Wars we all loved and took a massive huge dump on it.  The Last Jedi is by far and away the worst Star Wars movie of the saga. I am so disheartened.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I was disappointed with this movie. I had shunted a lot of my problems from the Force Awakens on to this film to fix and if anything TLJ made it worse and now left Episode 9 with a herculean task.<br/><br/>This movie seemed more concerned with subverting expectations and tropes than telling a cohesive story. Was it enjoyable to watch, yes. Much in the same way a Marvel movie is fun to watch. But I don't think I will rewatch this move for years to come like I have for the other Star Wars movies. I think that casual fans of Star Wars will be fine with this movie and I don't mean to sound snooty or elitist. Most of this movie's flaws fall into fridge logic. And most people don't waste time in their life sitting around thinking about it. So yeah take your kids, go see it at least once. I'm likely going to see it one more time at least so Disney already won in that regard, the people who will be most upset will be obligated to see this movie at least one or two times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Yeah, it's a run of the mill poor Star Wars movie with some of the most depressing plot sequences ever. Especially in Force Awakens but it only continues here. Bringing back old cast members is fun and games but not original in any way. Some weird historic turn we did here on Earth to deserve such petty rubbish. Aside from all that the actors do an ok job and the special effects are good of course but for how much they are making on this.. the locations, new ships, new re-imagining of weapons, etc, plot and script suck. Just a money generating machine is all Hollywood is. Pretty much the embodiment of Snoke's obnoxiously huge star ship. It's no longer art, just leeching statements of the left.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I didn't hate the movie, but there were a lot of moments where I didn't enjoy it very much.<br/><br/>The movied felt like it was focused on too many things at once. It kept shifting from scene to scene, distracting itself the entire way. I didn't have an issue with the comedy elements, if it made me laugh, then it did it's intended job. And the comedy made me laugh more than a few times.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were great too and for a PG-13 film, they managed to do a great job with the violence. Cutting people in half, grinding them to pieces, slashing their faces off with lightsabers, that was pretty amazing.<br/><br/>Disney has been focused on killing off all the original characters and I really disliked that. Characters like Han Solo and Luke Skywalker are reasons why I wanted new films to begin with. But it appears Disney has been systematically killing off these beloved icons.<br/><br/>Further, the whole scene where Leia survives a exposion and uses the force to survive the vaccume of space and fly back into a space ship was just completely absurd. Whoever thought that up should be fired. I may be done with the new Star Wars film(s) at this point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The visual is, as always, magnificent. Someone's gotta take over the franchise from the Skywalkers and the Solos, and I believe this movie did a great job in doing that. Rey's background is finally unveiled in this episode, and to the surprise of almost everyone, she's a no one (Hey, Darth Vader was a no one too!). That's bold. Luke has become a grudging, pessimistic, war-torn, reluctant old man. That's bold. It was revealed that Luke actually made Kylo Ren and destroyed Ben Solo by trying to kill him after sensing the "great potential for darkness". That's infinitely bold. Alright, there are indeed some dumb moments in this one, like the way Leia all of sudden was able to harness the force to safe herself, or the absolute zero chemistry of Finn and Rose (That awkward kiss tho...), or the occasional dry, unfunny jokes. But the only people that got ticked and enraged by Episode VIII are Star Wars nerds and fanboys. For me, as a general moviegoer, "The Last Jedi" is as good as any Star Wars movie can be. I like especially the dark turn of Luke's story arc and how he, Rey, and Kylo Ren questioned their integrity and moral values, how blurred the line can be between good and evil. This is a deep, provoking (For the better or worse), insightful movie that's worth the admission.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

With this episode, after a disastrous Episode 7, I am hopeless. The movie is long, packed with action which is good but the characters are not well written and most of them are misrepresented, not to mention the modern age plight in the movie:<br/>- the new characters are not capable of taking over from the old characters, they are just vague and you feel like there is no point in the whole movie. - the old characters, nearly all of them, seem to be totally different from previous parts. They are not who they were, they have different ideals. - women are strong, brave and clever whereas men are cowardly, stupid or impulsive without brains (in old Star Wars movies we had strong women and men characters and it wasn't pushed, here it is pushed)<br/><br/>All in all, could have been a great movie because I believe old and new could have existed next to each other but they didn't even try to do that, they just  wanted to get rid of the old and introduce the new which turned out to be a failure.<br/>3 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I have this bad habit, when I see Star Wars movie in theaters I simply cannot look at the downsides, and Im always leaving thinking each movie was better than the last. However though I did enjoy this movie as a whole. There were some small issues, and big ones, such as the glaring and often quite annoying political correctness constantly shoved down the viewers throat. You can tell the difference between the George Lucas films, and the disney films. Not just in cgi, in this context its unimportant. The main thing being that forced political correctness is, well nonexistent in George's films. Now, I'm not praising the prequels here. However this cannot be ignored. Not ignoring the fact that the cast is mostly quite good, such as performances from Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver really standing out for better. Im not saying there is a problem with a diverse cast, in fact, it can make a movie better. However at times you can start to see the changes for worse. The cast in this movie is incredibly politically driven, all female characters have major roles in the plot. All major leaders in the resistance are female. Princess Leia, is no longer a princess but now a general. Along with Admiral Holdo also being a woman. Leaving only 3 main protagonists as men. Finn, Poe, and Luke. With countless antagonists being imperial whites. Who also happen to have clearly no idea what they are doing.  Back to the female roles, Admiral Holdo's choices are, no matter what the lesson is trying to be, awful. Her choices where completely irrational and when the only person who attempts to make a difference is Poe. When he is literally and figuratively shot down by Leia and Admiral Holdo, they play it off as. Oh! He's just a rowdy boy, oh masculinity is so funny.<br/><br/>Ignoring the lesser important issue of forced political correctness. The plot itself, is, meh. To keep it simple 80% of the entire movie is rebel ships in space being picked off by the first order in a fight against time, so Finn, and newly introduced Rose have to find a codebreaker to hack first order technology that can track ships through lightspeed. A technology that has never appeared in a star wars movie. EVER! Meanwhile Luke and Rey are doing their own schenanigans on whatever planet The Force Awakens ended on. One key subplot regarding the Resistance, is the codebreaker thing I mentioned prior and the quest to get it turns into maybe one of the slowlest and most pointless feeling segments in Star Wars history. The entire sequence to get the codebreaker ends in Finn and Rose getting put in jail. Where they meet another code breaker, who, 30 minutes later, hands them to the first order. Whatever emotion that part was trying to convey, it only left me personally unsatisfied. Another issue, much shorter is my issue with the fate of Snoke. He just dies with no development. Creating a Return of the Jedi moment but instead of being the climax of the trilogy its only the middle act. So Snokes existence was entirely a placeholder for Kylo to just take over, moving on I guess....<br/><br/>In all the movie is riddled with seemingly useless plots, choices by the characters that are as stupid as a white girl in a horror movie, and politically forced agendas that can leave us with the fact that Star Wars will never be the same again.......</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's clear to see Disney had no idea what they were going to do after the Force Awakens.  So much of the movie acts as a contradiction to what they first established and even the Star Wars universe as a whole.  All of the story seeds they sowed in TFA have now been dug up and there is now little I care about going into the 3rd movie.  Rei and Darth Emo will fight and Darth Emo will have some redeeming thing happen to him. The good guys will have a new hope for rebuilding the galaxy and Rei will start to train Jedi again.  I guess that's fitting The Force Awakens was a repeat of A New Hope.  The next movie should be a remake of the Return of the Jedi.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8020689"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">At 44 years of age, and having seen all previous Star Wars films I was astounded that none of my 3 teen age children had any interest in watching this film with me. Not even my wife would go - I had to see it alone.<br/><br/>There is a significant difference in the feel of this film compared to the previous ones.  While it retains the inter-galactic CGI fight scenes, most of the acting is done by humans - and a significant shift towards women.  As a result there is significantly less gunslinger and instead infused with more compassion and a strong feminist undertone.<br/><br/>While you may feel this is undeserved, I have but three complaints of things that need to be restored to these films:<br/>1. Fight scenes need to be more convincing.  The light saber action from the leads was very weak and contrived. I've seen high school plays with the same level of physical competence.<br/>2. Its time to work harder on the mechanics/Sci-Fi harder.  The drawn-out chase of the resistance cruiser was simply preposterous.  The pursuing ships have jump/light speed capability, plenty of fuel and greater numbers - they could easily pop forward and turn around to corner them.  Sigh.<br/>3. Having incompetent youths smacks of Harry Potter, not Star Wars.  If you can't break in and bust up the tracking device, then fighting your way (or lucking your way) out of being surrounded and captured is also ridiculous.<br/><br/>I give this film a 6 because of the visual spectacle.  The plot was decent but choreography, music/sound and the engagement/entertainment level have definitely faltered.  Lets just hope they sell enough tickets in China to continue investing in future films.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

When you're given the whole Star Wars Universe and this is all you can come up with is really sad. Sad to me because I love Star Wars, grew up with the toys from in the 80's and have an ingrained affinity for the Star Wars universe etc, but I am flawed as to how 100's of millions of dollars can buy pretty looking action scenes, yet a boring plot, mediocre performances and immature scripting. Remember those scenes from the originals that gave you goosebumps at pivotal points? This movie sadly has none that I can recall. I can imagine the pressure from Disney to sell toys must be immense, but if this movie had some substance... as a 43yr old I would've bought an expensive toy for myself. Now, my advice is, wait to see it on Netflix (with a 60inch TV or better) especially given how long and hollow the movie is @ 2hrs33min.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The key problem seems to be the "plot" was merely a vehicle to move from one cool scene to another and when the implications of something in one of those scenes clashes with a later scene it's just ignored. Its not even a problem of plot holes which implies there is a coherent plot with a few issues. Instead it's like the movies is just a series of plot islands with only a vague connection to each other, let alone the events and characters of the previous movies. I was entertained in the moment, but after the fact (which is the real test of a great movie) I am not impressed. Can they salvage it from here? Probably, but this movie is always going to be a gaping wound in the larger narrative I fear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8019523"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I had to chime in. This movie is NOT a 0, 1, 2, or 3. That's just plain ridiculous. I am a 44 year old avid Star Wars fan, hater of the prequels, and minimal follower of the TV shows, books, & games.<br/><br/>Though I would've loved to see Luke (and Han & Leia) come back to this trilogy in their 1983 character personae, it probably would've come off as kind of silly. It's completely believable that the same wide-eyed Luke who saved his father's soul against all odds, became a Jedi, and overthrew the Empire (w/ his Dad's help, of course)....would or could feel this way 30 years later. PLENTY of real-world, bright-future 20-30 year olds are bitter old people at 50-60 due to other events that happened to them. How many earnest, whitebread American boys have gone off to war enthusiastically with valor, honor, courage...and wound up as bitter, wounded veterans living in self-isolation decades later? Not an exact analogy, I know..but it's not THAT far-fetched. Even at the end of Return of The Jedi, Luke wasn't celebrating and laughing w/ the others. It was bittersweet as he looked off at the ghosts of his father, Obi-Wan, and Yoda. The weight of the world was still really on Luke's shoulder. His father had died. What to do next? He wasn't at all the same Luke who was excited to go "pick up some power converters" any more.<br/><br/>All that said, YES-- I found it hard to swallow that Luke would stand over his nephew's bed and contemplate killing him for ANY reason. That's pretty silly or could've been filled in better. No, it's NOT a bad thing that Rey has no "royal lineage." How STUPID would it have been if she was just another force user related to someone we know on screen? It's ALWAYS been established that force users can come from anywhere. "If he had been born in the Republic, we would've identified him early" (Qui-Gon, TPM-- Ick, can't believe I'm quoting that film).  In ANH, Obi-Wan described Anakin as a "great pilot"--not as some kind of royalty or anyone of governmental importance when they "met." (Of course, we know now that he was a slave racing pods...)... Only the SKYWALKERS have grown to carry that "important political/governmental lineage" throughout the story-- not all force users in general...BUT yes, it's SUCKED since TFA that Rey is a Mary Sue who "gets" all of this w/out training. I was hoping they would at least have given her an Anastasia complex--and say she had been trained by Luke until she was taken and left on Jakku--and she just consciously blocked it out...but at least Rian Johnson TRIED to sort of give some general reason as to how people are now mastering the force w/out using it. After TFA, I kept asking--w/ powerful people like Rey, why they are all so deadset on finding Luke anyway? All this over one man? Kylo Ren is stopping blaster bolts mid-air. Johnson cleverly answers that in one line when Luke quips "...Do you expect me to just come back and take on the whole First Order with a laser sword?"<br/><br/>Luke's death fit THIS story beautifully and poetically. Sure - -it raises questions-- Why does the wind blow his astrally-projected hair? Does Leia FEEL the kiss? Why can 3p0 see Luke too? The answers to some of this make 'ya say "OK, then should he have been wounded by Kylo's blade anyway?" But Star Wars has ALWAYS had questions on that level... The biggest now may be -- "does anyone really ever die?" If dead force users can burn down trees and such-- Is the death of a character really even a death at all ? ANH set up the line "strike me down and I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine"--but that always seemed false looking at how little Spirit Ben could do.. Now, it's starting to seem real...but then, should we even call Luke's death a death? The problem w/ Star Wars is all of these concepts were poorly fleshed out to begin w/ --and we all had our own expectations and the more movies we add by more and more directors & writers..the more it stretches and starts to fall apart.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson has done an excellent job creating a thoroughly entertaining movie (and I go to the movies to be entertained--period!)...He did something unique-ish for Star Wars and he did it with love for the subject matter. When I watch the prequels, I see contempt for George's audience and I feel like they were made with utter disregard for the details of the story. Say what you will about the storyline in TLJ but Rian Johnson made this movie carefully with love and a genuine interest in Star Wars. I personally like Rogue One A LOT more...and I am sad, too, to see that this is how our OT characters have wound up (and yes, "flying Leia" was 1 silly scene...but KIND OF makes sense)...TLJ hasn't left me excited to see where this goes next...but for the 8th movie in this story...Rian did something as creative, colorful, different, and thought-provoking as possible. It's NOT a bad movie..maybe not a fantastic one--but it's pretty darn good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson made his film and made creative decisions and stood by it. He took risks and it shows. The film while not perfect, is wonderful to look at. It has powerful moments and the characters are complex with full detailed arcs. The performances are stellar from all the leads. So why are the criticism so harsh.<br/><br/>Are you saying that this film is worse than the Fast and the Furious 8 or it's on the same level as Baywatch? Don't let your high expectations fool you. This is more than what the prequels gave us. The Last Jedi gives a proper homage to the original trilogy and tries to expand it. For me that earns my respect alone.<br/><br/>The Empire Strikes Back was also a divisive film when it came out. Now is regarded as the best of the SW Films. Maybe time will be kind to TLJ.<br/><br/>The Force is strong on Rian.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I hope that Disney learns from this i wont put Jar Jar Johnson in charge again of a SW film.<br/>Also , Disney should know that if they make the magic dissapear people will stop coming to see SW films because it is just another Sci-fi film, Nothing extraordinary...<br/><br/>Hope Disney learns from it...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8019057"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The Last Jedi is a major step forward for the Star Wars Saga, and is a triumph for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>1) Characterisation. It's this - not plot - that is the key to any good story. Rian Johnson pushes these characters into new and fascinating places. Poe, simply a hot-shot pilot in TFA, is forced to realise that being a hot-shot isn't all that matters, and the way the film handles his and Leia's relationship is wonderful. Finn, still only interested in saving himself and Rey, realises that the struggles of the galaxy are bigger than him and commits himself to the Resistance. It goes without saying that Rey and Kylo have the most fascinating story - both characters more complex than the basic shades of light and dark this series is used to portraying.<br/>2) Myth and Legacy. Luke Skywalker is a legend, both in the world of these movies and in fandom. This presents a challenge. You can't have the same character you said goodbye to 35 years ago - that would be dull and pointless. He has to evolve and have an arc. But we've seen from AotC that having a beloved older character have their badass moment in the spotlight doesn't work. TLJ does something far more poignant. Luke is broken; crippled by the burden of his own myth, disillusioned by the cyclical nature of the battle between light and dark and wracked with guilt over a single moment of weakness. But by the end of this movie Luke doesn't pull out his lightsaber and cut the First Order to pieces. Instead, he becomes a true Jedi, refusing to fight anyone and pulling off the greatest force trick in history to allow the rebels to escape. More importantly, however, he finally allows his myth to take over, and gives the galaxy the grand spectacle it needs to find hope. (The kids at the end even play out Luke's last stand on Crait with makeshift toys. His myth has taken hold.)<br/>3. Subversion. What did you want? Rey to be a Skywalker? That isn't a story - Rey being a nobody who rises from nothing in a world where those with the real family legacy (Luke and Kylo) are crippled by it. Did you want Snoke to continue being mean and mysterious from the shadows until Kylo turned good and killed him in IX? That's been done - Kylo killing him and cementing his place as the series' villain is fresh and fascinating and leaves IX a blank slate. These broader points aside, TLJ contains some of the most stunning camerawork and acting ever seen in a Star Wars film (Hamill and Driver in particular are incredible). There are scenes here (the throne room, Luke and Leia, Luke's last stand) that are among the best in the series. Yes, it drags in places (Canto Bight in particular). Yes, it takes time and repeat viewings to fully digest. But Star Wars needed to be challenged if it was to grow as a franchise.<br/><br/>It is valid to be disappointed if this was not the movie you'd hoped for, but that doesn't negate its quality. To say that it is a terrible film is simply wrong. You can disagree with its choices but you cannot deny the quality of filmmaking on display here. I think if some fans were to let go of the stories the wrote in their heads and try to understand the beauty and complexity of this one, they might even start to enjoy the franchise they claim to love.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8018859"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">First of, I can see why this movie is at the very least lauded for being a divergence from the Lucas story because it is exactly that. It is a very heavy handed slap in the face to the original story established by the original series. While Force Awakens was lambasted for being a knockoff of its predecessor, Last Jedi in turn tries very forcefully to destroy any vestige of connection to the past. "Kill it(the past)if you have to" proclaims Kylo Ren and that they did. What they do not consider is if doing so was actually the right choice, so desperate they were to forge off on a path of their own. As a seemingly odd olive branch, the movie does pay fan service to the original characters with brief nostalgic moments between them, but all too fleeting, and then quickly snuffed out by the main storyline.<br/><br/>I will start with my main issues first. First of, the use of force powers in these latest episodes is to the point of overkill. The reason the Jedi were so revered in the original series was because their presence and their use of powers were used so sparingly and TASTEFULLY. Kylo Ren's and Rey's use of the force is so often and so blatantly excessive that they may as well have Marvel style superhero costumes on. Last Jedi also does not even attempt to offer any explanation of how Rey is basically the most powerful Jedi in existence despite the lack of training or any exposure to the force. This was already evident in Episode 7 but I was patient enough to wait for an explantion in Episode 8 but none was forthcoming, making any possible explanation in Episode 9 impossibly believable. Princess Leia meanwhile has been relegated to meme status with her space flying powers after another (way too many in this movie..or any movie) fake out death scene. Luke Skywalker also pitches in with more force power display, this time with astral projection powers which basically form the crux of the climax in this movie and devolves him from Jedi Master to cheap parlor trick magician. And of course, Rey saves the day by lifting at least 5 tons worth of boulders - again with no training. OP much?<br/><br/>I would have given this movie a lower score but in honesty, that is really not fair, considering the movie execution was fair in that it did what it was supposed to do: establish a new storyline for a new generation who have no connection to the Lucas mythology. It did it with some shark jumping moments, but it did it nonetheless. John Williams score as always was spot on, and I can easily say this movie falls almost completely flat and spiritless without him. Despite being way too long as most movies now in this era (are movies even really edited nowadays?) if you have never seen it before it keeps you interested, despite the short comings of the payoffs.<br/><br/>However, at the end this movie saddens me. As it becomes even more evident that Disney will milk this license until it is dry, the quality of content to come out will undoubtedly be diluted and it has already started. Say what you want about Lucas and his own marketing when the series was with him, but despite knowing that just like Disney he can release a movie every year and make a billion dollars for each one just on the license alone, he kept the original trilogy untouched for 15 years because I feel that he really did care about this story and his characters. And make no mistake, they are HIS characters. With this latest iteration, I don't know if the House of Mouse really feels that connected with Rey, Kylo, Finn and Poe. They are well researched very sellable commodities and easily replaceable again, whenever Disney decides to restart a new trilogy, likely sooner than later.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Whole movie serves as a feminist propaganda vehicle. Basicaly it is a 0815 scifi flick and noone would notice, if it werent labeled star wars.

Many Star Wars fan boys are irritated since the film didn't follow what they believed should have been a different plot. The characters are interesting, the dialog and relationships between charaters are great and the light humor added in every so often is a delight. Many fans were irritated with how Snoke and Luke were killed but I honestly believe they're overreacting because they wanted something else from the film. The people who are giving this a 0 are immature and need to grow up, it's absured. Watch the film and create your own opinion. I'm delighted to see how well the new characters are developing and I'm so happy I didn't have to see an elaborate training montage for Rey, I mean come on, every damn movie has a stupid training montage. The negativity is just a bunch of fan boys over reacting for petty reasons. A bad movie? Not at all. This is an excellent movie that did it's own thing instead of giving people what they want. I expected something between the lines of what everyone wanted but I'm happy that the film exceeded my expectations. Watch the film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I will not see it nor ever buy Star Wars merchandise ever again, but I will be interested in seeing the numbers it makes.  Tells me more about the world we live in if it makes good box office.  This one has made a lot of money.  I have to hope that it mostly due to people's lack of knowledge of how hate filled it is.  They were hoping to see an inclusive Star Wars movie.

JJ Abrams managed to give his storm troopers a sense of character and individuality, they actually felt like effective soldiers;  Johnson turned them back to faceless idiotic canon fodders here. All those intriguing elements like Rey's heritage and Snoke's background all got thrown out of the window, with nothing interesting replacing them with... The only question after seeing the movies how are they gonna deal with Princess Leia now...  They should have just reshot the movie and let her die... Bringing her back from outer space with her Force swim destroyed all the emotional weight that was created by Kylo blowing her up... When she opened the airlock after her swim, Poe and the others in the hallway should have been sucked out into outer space btw...<br/><br/>What is up with all these low tech World War II space battle tactics?! There is no gravity in space, why did the Rebel bombers have to be on top of the New Order Destroyer to drop the bombs? How come there is only 1 controller for the bombs to drop in the bomb bay? I would expect them to at least have a Blutooth connection in the cockpit... Kylo took out the Rebel main ships command deck with ease, he didnt have to return to the fleet, he could have easily finished the Rebel ships off by himself! Cant some of the New Order ship light warp ahead of the Rebel ships and sandwich the Rebels? The idea of chasing the Rebels until they run out of gas was un engaging as watching paint dry.<br/><br/>Creating the Rose character was absolutely pointless, and they could have had Poe to go on with Finn for more buddy buddy relationship development. Benicio Del Toros character was only in the movie briefly but was much better than Rose, they should have just used him to replace Roses part in the movie. the casino planet was ridiculously uninspiring... Couldnt they have made a giant casino palace with gladiatorial fights instead? The sudden introduction of child slavery and animal cruelty was very distracting. Instead of being feared, General Hux, the commander of the planet destroying elite New Order fleet and army, Johnson turned him into a joke in the first scene with him and Poe, then later he was only on screen to get either choked or thrown against wall...  The commander of the Obliterator looked a lot more menacing.  Terrible direction with the villains on Johnsons part.<br/><br/>The introduction of the idea of how you can use a single ship to wipe out a force more than 50 times your size is utterly stupid. Now I expect the Rebels to use this kamikaze strategy every time they fight a New Order fleet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie is currently the second best Star Wars movie after Empire and after a few years of reflection might just be better.<br/><br/>Why? Why is this movie so good and so misunderstood? Why has the reaction been so divisive? It all has to do with the Force, the Sith and the Jedi. What is the force? What are Jedi? What are Sith? There has always been something fishy about the whole concept of Light vs. Dark.<br/><br/>When you re-watch the original trilogy you get a sense that Ben Kenobi is a character that is somewhat practical. He is an end justify the means kind of guy. That is NOT what people remember him as being. It is only after idealizing him and injecting oneself with a Dose of Nostalgia that we tint our lenses. We cannot see clearly. We let out emotions cloud our judgement. Luke is an idealist in the original movies. He hasn't passed the hardships that Yoda and Ben have and neither does he passed them ever in the original trilogy.<br/><br/>The seeds are all planted in the original trilogy. Yoda and Ben are possible futures for the evolution of Luke as a character. Both Jedi Masters that went through hardships and turned them away from their initial ideal state. Both exile themselves. One becomes practical and the other a funny hermit. One gets serious, the other uses laughter to drown his sorrow.<br/><br/>In the prequels you can clearly see Ben's and Yoda's idealized personalities. Ben (better call him Obi-wan or Obi) lives by the Jedi Code, he believes in the institutions of the Jedi and is one of the best devotees. Is not until the end of Revenge that finally Obi starts reflecting on his personality. The same happens to Yoda.<br/><br/>Righteousness is important but also not anymore. The institutions that carried the Jedi were flawed. That is why Darth Sidious managed to do what he did. That he managed to do that is evidenced enough that there was fundamentally something wrong with the Jedi or at least, how they interacted and governed themselves in relation to the force.<br/><br/>The THEMES of the movie are the culmination of all the previous Star Wars movies. People will start talking about this inconsistency and that inconsistency and how that plot point was stupid, and tell them this:<br/><br/>Oh, it makes more sense that Qui-gon and Obi going through the center of a planet?<br/>More consistent than Ewoks beating the Empire?<br/>More credible than Jar Jar Binks becoming an Imperial Senator?<br/>More believable than Obi-wan never found by the Empire when he still uses Kenobi and wheres his Lightsaber?<br/>Any part less epic than Boba Fett dying at the beginning of Return?<br/>Any part more ridiculous than Luke blowing a Death Star by some photon torpedos that did a 90 sharp turn south to enter a shaft?<br/><br/>Star Wars has also being ridiculous. It has always being Fantasy more than Sci-fi. It has always had humor. But, a star wars movie had NEVER giving us a more fulfilling moral and force complexities and dilemmas than this one. It is easily the best of every made after 1983. See it and love it. If you don't you will in 5 years.<br/><br/>P.S. There has been a lot of garbage about political messages in this movie. These are the messages: Women can be in positions of power. Women can be shown in fighting squadrons just as often as men. There exist war-profiteers. There can be a female minority lead character. All really basic, basic, basic, basic concepts. These are 1920's French ideals.<br/><br/>P.S.S. There has been arguments that this movie subverts what Star Wars is because it doesn't follow the Hero's journey. That is one of the worst arguments you can make about this movie. It does, it also evolves the concept.<br/><br/>P.S.S.S. May the force be with you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie was also not at all afraid to send you in a direction only to be yanked the opposite, but it works without completely botching the pace.

So many plot holes, that film just drowning in it. So many garbage stuffed in movie just for check. They don't actually reveal heroes, but show you stupid don't funny joke or action and large amount cute animals, hello Disney, bye bye Star Wars. Sanity or reason in this film logic they just forgot to put it. I add 2 points just because some heroes were better shown and some scenes were not bad. But it's one grain of logic in the desert off stupidity.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Look at the user rating. You just can't take glorious SW Universe and put anything you want in it. Please, learn from SW Extended Universe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's not even that it ignores established Star Wars canon or lore.<br/><br/>It is awful because it attempts to ruin everything about Star Wars that made it such a beloved story in the first place. Instead of wisdom, we get book burning. Instead of optimism and faith, we get nihilism. And instead of hope, we get pessimism and despair.<br/><br/>This movie is an all out assault on Star Wars as a phenomenon, it left me cold.

It's tempting to pour out my thoughts in bullet points.  To angrily outline the list of the this film's failures.  And it has so very many. But I will refrain.  The movie catastrophically falls short on every level, in every facet.  Yet I'll attempt to focus on why I feel this way, without cataloging and critiquing particular scenes and decisions.<br/><br/>Character development is nearly non-existent.  Daisy Ridley's very-likeable Rey neither grows, learns, or changes in this film.  The few conflicts or challenges she faces are fleeting.  As with the previous film, the Force "awakens" in her, with little effort on her part, or any explanation.  She's static.  Her most profound and interesting scenes were her interaction with Adam Driver's character, Kylo Ren. There's a hint at just how intriguing and imaginative the plot *could* have taken with those two.  I was briefly on the edge of my seat. Only to have a boring, predictable "Good vs. Evil" outcome.  Wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>Jon Boyega's character goes nowhere, in an almost literal sense.  He has an almost-meaningful scene near the end of the film.  Almost.  But he doesn't.  He literally could have remained in his bacta healing-tank the whole film, and it would have made zero difference.<br/><br/>When there is character development, it's awful. Poe Dameron, our favorite hotshot fighter pilot from The Force Awakens?  He quickly became my least favorite character.  Oscar Isaac's acting was great.  You'll just question why he was instructed to act that way.<br/><br/>Minus a scene or two, don't expect anything new from Leia, and you won't be disappointed.  That's ditto for Supreme Leader Snoke, General Hux, R2-D2, Chewie, Threepio, The First Order, and so on.  The movie simply doesn't have a lot of new information to share, least of all revelations.<br/><br/>Mark Hamill and Adam Driver did the best job they could, given the poor script, material, concepts, and erratic timing of the film.  They did excellent, considering with the pittance they had to work with.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, there's an actress playing a mechanic.  Seriously, I literally almost hit the "Submit" button for this review, before I remembered her, and added this sentence.  That's how important this new character was.<br/><br/>The most frustrating fact about this film is that a lot *happens*.  But not a lot *matters*.  Certainly there is no shortage of action, scenes, adventure, parallel plots, characters running around doing things, saying things. Yet roughly 2.5 hours later, when it's all concluded, the movie has gone...?  Nowhere.  Everything is essentially right back where it started.  You've got some powerful, evil First Order.  And you've got some underdog Resistance.  They still don't like each other.<br/><br/>Sure, there were some casualties along the way.  But really...they don't matter.  Their loss doesn't change anything, for better or worse.  Our heroes and villains simply haven't accomplished very much, or learned anything, or made any revelations.  "Hope you enjoyed another movie in the Star Wars universe!", they seem to shout.  "We'll give you more of the same in Star Wars 9!".  And given this movie's ending, the next film could literally be about *anything*.  The Last Jedi leaves you wondering "Is there genuinely anything left to show or talk about?"  It contains it's own built-in "reset button". By the conclusion of your time in the theater, you mentally and emotionally won't care anymore.<br/><br/>And that's the *worst* part of this film for me.  It made me not care about Star Wars anymore.  It's infuriating.  I'm left with no desire, curiosity, motivation, or incentive to watch another movie.  Who cares?  To my shock and dismay...not me.  I don't care what happens next.  Even the prequels kept me coming back for more.  This time, there's no new hope.<br/><br/>This ends my review, but wait!  Some important news is coming in...<br/><br/>Last Jedi Public Service Announcement:  Cute animals are important and should not be harmed!  Don't worry if you miss the message.  It's repeated using at least 3 new adorable species.  At least they don't annihilate stormtroopers with rocks and spears, Ewok-style...<br/><br/>Did you like the subtle comedy from The Force Awakens?  Me too!  Prepare (once again), for too much of a good thing.  It's not as bad as Jar Jar Binks, thankfully.  But it's obviously out of place, and you'll feel it instantly.<br/><br/>The Last Jedi: Morality and Ethics Review!<br/><br/>1) Is it important to obey orders and follow leadership, or follow your heart and to hell with the rules?  Prepare to be wrong, regardless of your answer.<br/><br/>2) Is a noble sacrifice, for the greater good, a correct and justifiable decision?  Prepare to be wrong and confused, regardless of your answer.<br/><br/>3) Is a preemptive strike morally okay, when the evil is certain?  Prepare for 3 separate, equally plausible, but not-established conclusions!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As a stand-alone sci-fi/fantasy flick it is perhaps not too bad, but taken as part of a long epic story it seems to make absolutely zero sense. Cliffhangers and characters set up in the 'The Force Awakens' turn out to be red herrings and are dropped unceremoniously. New characters are introduced (Purple hair lady, random annoying Asian chick) out of the blue apparently to appeal to diversity quotas. Old characters are either killed without ceremony (Admiral Ackbar) or come back to life in Superman style (Leia). Bad comedy permeates nearly every scene, puncturing any attempt to create suspense. What plot points do work are shamelessly ripped off from the original movies.<br/><br/>The franchise's great hero returns and is a miserable old man sitting on a rock who doesn't want to play ball any more. He has gone from being the great optimist to a curmudgeon with a whisky bottle. Why? His teenage nephew was a bit angsty. When he finally gets off his ass to do something he just becomes a hologram or something and vanishes into thin air. Is that it? Luke Skywalker is now Jeff Lebowski with less humour and white russians.  The new lead character Rey is able without any explanation to use The Force without any training. Entire subplots divert to meaningless planets which go nowhere. Hamfisted political points (capitalism and patriarchy bad, mmkay) are shoehorned into this film, despite the irony of it being a multi-billion dollar global franchise which never really had a 'diversity problem' in the first instance.<br/><br/>But nothing matters, this film will make squillions of dollars and Disney will milk this cash cow for all it can get (the second thing we see of Luke is him milking some weird alien cow on his rock, surely an in-joke about this very fact) and The Last Jedi will fade into memory while an endless stream of CGI sequels stretch into space and devalue the epic majesty and wonder of the original trilogy. Somewhere in a galaxy not very far far away, fat Hollywood execs are laughing all the way to the bank....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I, like so very many, played with Star Wars action figures and toys relentlessly, reenacting and inventing over and over. There was ALWAYS some kid that wanted to play too who wanted to kill Luke, or deface Leia, or wanted to do nothing but make the figures have sex, etc etc....

Had it delivered something that was equally compelling somehow, it might be forgivable but it unfortunately falls incredibly short of that high aim. Try as I might, preconceptions aside, I cannot forgive the means to this director's end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I understand we all need to move on with the Star Wars universe, it needs to move on from Skywalker, but why the need to destroy the old movies and their heroes. With the millions of dollars available and the "creative minds" in the industry could we not have moved on AND kept the heroes from the past ? Why destroy it all? why burn it down? why alienate half the fan base? Movie was a cool movie, but a terrible, terrible experience. One that gets worse as time goes on. A betrayal of my love of Star Wars. The plot holes aside (which their are MANY), I don't care as much about them. I am OK with Han, Luke and Leia dying off and new people coming in, its honestly OK with me... but why did they have to destroy the characters that made Star Wars they way it was. Why could Luke not have fought Kylo for real and died sparking the light of hope ? what harm would that have done anyone ? he died anyway ? What harm would it have been to have Leia killed in space ? what did she do the rest of the movie ? nothing. It would have ended her arch. Now its going to be done off screen...<br/><br/>What harm would it have done to explain Snoke more ? and how the First order came to be ? It would not have taken much screen time... instead we got horse racing. What harm would it have done to the story to have Akbar so kamikaze instead of a new character who hardly speaks at all ? I doubt anyone would have said after ..."why didn't they invent a new purple haired lady to do that ?... what a waste of a potential story line !" My opinions are my own and I'm the one living with them comfortably. No one else needs to care, I'm OK with that. Life goes on, but I have a hard time explaining to myself why Disney/Rian had to burn down a universe I grew up with to make a new one. They could easily have had both. Instead its divided everyone down lines and helped ruin the Majic of it all. Why ? What for ?  A New Star Wars ? I'm ready for that ? but I also wanted Old Star Wars ! Its important to me... I can accept anything, I can accept death of beloved characters... I cannot accept destruction for destructions sake... slightly depressed over this. 0 out of ten is too high... Read the books (the ones about Thrawn) and that was a Star Wars experience... brought life to my ideas of what happened after RoTJ... the Last Jedi was Star Wars murder. Bold, new, and aweful.<br/><br/>Cool effects tho.... hyperspace death was a really cool scene in 3D. I was amazed at the time.... when I got home tho, ... I was like... why didn't the ships that ran out of gas just to that in the first place... the hospital ship captain even stayed with his ship as it was being destroyed ?.. he could have done it. How did the other ships around the Mega ship blow up as well Km's away? but everyone in the Mega ship yards away seemed to live ? How did Phasma end up at the other end of the hanger with more troopers, when Finn and rose were still where they were ? Did she get blown to the other end and just happened to land in front of a horde of troopers who remained on their feet ? So much to think about later on that once the movie ended I started to question things.<br/><br/><br/>People say read the books.. they help explain things. But any movie that requires you to read books to get a movies message, is a BAD movie.... AND any book that requires you to watch a movie is a BAD book. You cannot argue that... even if you want to argue it for arguments sake, you know in your heart your wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
