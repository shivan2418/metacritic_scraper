I did however enjoy the last couple of entries (the Force Awakens and Rogue One) enough to the point of anxiously anticipating this effort.  I have to say though I was a little disappointed.  The movie suffered from overkill resorting to the same themes over and over again.  I often wondered why Mark Hamil never achieved the career accomplishments of his costars.  Now I remember.  He's not a great actor.  There were attempts at humor that I thought were inappropriate as well.  Without giving away spoilers it wasn't a total bust.  There was plenty of action and a few poignant moments but I have to say over all, this one missed the mark.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In Return Of The Jedi, Luke doesn't act like a Jedi Master. HE throws down his Lighsaber after his fight with Darth Vader, which is not how a Jedi Master acts. Then he stands there and monologs to the Emperor, another thing a Jedi master doesn't do. For all of his troubles he gets zapped. So to say that Luke wasn't portrayed correctly in The Last Jedi, his portrayal in Return Of The Jedi Didn't make him look that great either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I wanted to like this film in spite of its awkwardly Whedon-ish dialogue and tv-like plot, but the visual effects and camera work (which were just above average --<br/>strange considering TLJ was the most anticipated movie of 2017) were not enough to sway me. It wasn't an enjoyable film, mostly because the main characters were written as unlikable, miserable jerks. Where's all the mystery, excitement, and fun? Aren't Star Wars movies supposed to be fun?

Writer/Director Rian Johnson has created a pastiche of film artistry, that borrows from the ethereal works of Akira Kurosawa, to the comedic stylings of Terry Gilliam. Star Wars: The Last Jedi carves out a fresh take on George Lucas's fantasy; injecting a blend of humor, action, and emotional depth that rivals any blockbuster released in the past decade. Though not a perfect film, which stumbles most in its "Canto Bight" sequences that look like something out of the pages of a young adult novel, The Last Jedi manages to thrill at nearly every corner, making a great effort to shed the nostalgic glow of the franchise, and dragging Star Wars into the modern era, even more so than its predecessor - The Force Awakens.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Don`t bother. Lousy script. Much of the plot "borrowed" from previous SW films. RJ was following Disney Inc. orders to change the audience demogrphics, ie make it more apppealing to women, Asians and Black folk so more female leads, Rose is thrown in and Finn is given more scenes. Unfortunately the characters are so underdeveloped you dont care about them. Other reviews discuss the poor plot lines, the disrespect to the series as a whole. In short, a waste of time.

Disney, Rian Johnson and anybody involved with this nonsense of a film should look it up. I don't care if you want to make Luke a depressed grump, throw the Jedi/Sith concepts in the trash and totally disregard all plot and character points from the previous film in the series. It's stupid but if that's what you want to do then fine. As long as these drastic changes have reasons behind them and as long as those reasons are *consistent* with the existing story, plot and characters then it's all good. If you pivot everything toward these ridiculous (and boring) new plot points and character personalities while giving reasons that are *also inconsistent* with the established story thread, then you're just being flat out lazy. It's basic story telling FFS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Fans go into a movie expecting a general direction. For example, you watch Return of the King (3rd LOTR movie) expecting Frodo to finish destroying the ring. The Last Jedi is like Frodo saying **** it, forget that we all agreed to form the fellowship, nothing matters, I'm going home, the end.<br/><br/>They seemed so obsessed with subverting audience expectations. Instead of trying to exceed audience expectations to deliver an amazing movie, they instead chose to go the opposite direction of what fans want.<br/><br/>I'm no marketing expert, but creating a product designed to piss off your customers seems like a bad idea. And then they go blaming the customers for being haters and idiots for not liking the sh!t they were trying to sell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7965251"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">It's the cinematic equivilent of when Coca Cola changed their recipe/formula to 'New Coke...'    <br/><br/>This whole sequal trilogy should have started with the events leading up to The Force Awakens. They clearly wanted a new and younger cast to market and a new and younger audience to market to. A mistake. Star Wars hit the sweet spot where everyone can enjoy it. It transcends, it's generational, it's mythic. The Lord of The Rings has the same type of appeal, books and the films. The Hobbit is more of a children's book but still appeal and 'that' trilogy of films is an acknoweldged disaster.             <br/><br/>The majority of plot points set up in The Force Awakens are not followed. They nare discarded or are subverted for the sake of being unexpected. The map to Luke Skywalker for example. I doubt Luke was in permanent exile, more like taking time out soul searching and looking for deeper answers? Why have map in the first place? Just in case? No. What's wrong with many of these so called critics? No play, no premiere, no back stage pass etc? I doubt Luke would have even attacked Ben Solo first? "Knowledge and defence, never attack." Character decisions deliberately written in the opposite way to be 'different' and 'unexpected' is ultimately out of character. Sure subvert some story points, writing 101, but with so many aspects altered to fit this new narrative and regardless of what came befor makes little to no sense. <br/><br/>The humour in this film is pure parody, farce, mistimed and mistolaced. "Use the farce." I was expecting, "I can't breathe in this thing." "It's only a flesh wound." It's not Star Wars.  <br/><br/>The music is superb by John Williams and stands out compared to The Force Awakens. The film is generally an aesthetically authentic, good looking and well shot film. Millions of dollars on screen but overall the feel is cheap due to story and charactisation.    <br/><br/>I preferred the pacing over TFA. To some extent.TFA was action every couple lines of dialogue. "Yeah I knew Luke." Aaannd aaaction. Rathtar scene, oh my god! The film within the film subplot with Finn and Rose on Canto Bright is dreadful. It slows the whole film down and makes it too long.           <br/><br/>The Force connection communication Betwen Rey and Kylo Ren is straight out of Twilight. It's not Star Wars. The Leia 'space' moment and she's out for the count for most of the film. <br/><br/>Admiral Ackbar<br/><br/>Captain Phasma<br/><br/>Why did Yoda use the persona (Hmm laugh) he used to test Luke when they first met? That persona was an act.<br/><br/>Luke is Luke at the end but it's too late. Wasted and if what happens to him even needed at all? Now that would be different to keep him around. Gandalf him back.I agree it's not what many Star Wars fans wanted or expected. There are so many things wrong with this film that I cannot give it a pass.   <br/><br/>I am not a bot or politically affiliated with anyone or anything. I felt the need to say something. It's not just a film, especially when you grew up with all the toys etc. It's part of the fabric of our story telling culture. I am/was an Original Trilogy kid, 'fanboy,' 'purist,' whatever the pithy noun/adjective/pejorative is this week. Time to be counted.<br/><br/>Equality cannot be achieved at the expense of others.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is a long boring slog where they try to be unexpected but this just means there is no emotional payoff for anything that happens. It is also all over the place. In one scene a character sacrifices herself and this is meant to be nobel but then only a little while later another character does the same and it is show as foolish. They build up the big bad then kill him before he does anything. They have a scene about the mystery of Rey's parents then reveal who her parents are doesn't matter. The romance between Rey and Finn is established in the first movie but they have barely any interaction in this one and Finn meets someone new. Star Wars was so captivating because it was a fairy tale set in space about a white knight saving a princess from a black knight in a castle. It was a story about morality. This film doesn't know what it is because it tries to be everything except a Star Wars film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Who the hell is in the first order any more? There's some theorys going around that Snoke isn't really dead and I almost believe them just from a numbers standpoint. Who else is there?! A beatable Kylo Ren...Hux is worthless and the stormtroopers who killed NO ONE in this movie. BB8 killed 5 of them by hijacking an Atst..it's liked watching Season 4 of Rebels (so far)! Just have the good guys win 99% of the battles! SCREW THAT. It's a WAR<br/><br/>Anyways, as routine as Force Awakens was..he set up Rian Johnson pretty well. You can see who the Knights of Ren are, why Kylo turned on Luke..do whatever the hell you want with Rey, Luke, Finn, Phasma, Leia, Snoke etc and then he does this?<br/><br/>Do they have some rivalry going on behind the scenes?<br/><br/>Did he not like some seasons of Lost or did JJ not like Looper?!<br/><br/>This almost looks like a parody/grudge!<br/><br/>Nice freaking use of PHASMA/ACKBAR, btw! Give them no glory..no defining moment...GREAT DECISION.<br/><br/>There's been some conspiracy going around saying that bots hijacked rottentomatoes and gave Last Jedi a 53 (from the fans). Man, you're looking it the wrong way..how in the HELL did it get a 92% from the critics! Of course, IGN gave it a 97..but they might give the worst movie ever a 75! Have they reviewed Major League 3 yet?<br/><br/>Anyways, I loved Rogue One and I know Ron Howard won't screw up Solo and am glad Johnson has NOTHING to do with the Obi Wan movie!<br/><br/>Last Jedi = LAST PLACE. Attack of the Clone is 10 times the movie this was!<br/><br/>P.S. Watch Clone Wars﻿! Everyone who doesn't is doing a DISSERVICE to themselves!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'll try to keep my review spoiler free. Let's start with the beginning. So apparently in like a 1 month time frame or something the Resistance has gone from a tremendous victory against an already crumbling successor to the Empire to being almost completely and utterly wiped out and is in flight for its life. That already is a preposterous set up.<br/><br/>Then, also, Leia, for some reason, some how, with no explanation, is all of a sudden a competent Force user and manages to save her life and doing other fancy things using the Force. Then the movie is 152 minutes long, that's not bad in itself but most of the movie is filler. It was like they reached the 2 hour mark and the director was like "this isn't long enough, let's add a new sub-plot that leads to absolutely nowhere and accomplished almost literally nothing." That's right, the whole Finn-Rose ark is actually completely pointless and nothing comes of it whatsoever, and it's probably almost a third of the movie.<br/><br/>Also the director has apparently never heard of character death. So many points in this movie would be improved if some protagonist died or made a sacrifice or things fell through. However every single time this is about to happen, even after you think it happens, everything turns out fine because plot armor. There are multiple points where characters should in no reasonable way been able to do what they did or survive what happened but hey, they're the good guys, so they gotta live.<br/><br/>If this movie was 45 minutes shorter and they cut out the utterly pointless Finn-Rose ark I would have given it a 5 instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is dishonest; it isn't the diversity and (more specifically) the female empowerment, but the in-your-face preaching about it, that is so off-putting.<br/><br/>It's all very calculated.  A purple-haired female admiral, looking like the last thing the audience would expect, comes onto the scene from out of nowhere.  Poe even says, "That's not what I was expecting."  And in so doing, he is supposed to represent us, the audience.  Then, when he is schooled for thinking wrongly, in actuality it's us being schooled.<br/><br/>But we're not sexist, are we?  We accept Leia Organa as the leader of the Resistance.  But they deliberately present us with this new character, speaking condescendingly and dismissively to the most heroic member of the Resistance, just so they can bait us into being annoyed with her...so that they can then preach at us for feeling that way.<br/><br/>It's the ultimate Mary Sue moment: Come from out of nowhere, teach us an in-your-face lesson, be 100% right, and go down in a blaze of glory.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The last jedi transports us to the classics while mantaining a thrilling narrative and risking new plot twists. As always, John Williams shines in the soundtrack. It is a shame the majority of fans don't like it, especially since the main reason is because "it does not conform with any of the fan theories". Isn't it better to be surprised? Looking forward to see more Ryan Johnson star wars movies!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Bassically a combination of zero respect for preexisting fans or source material combined with a total lack of original ideas, good acting or decent writing. Throw in some very blatant political agendas (anti-Trump, radical feminism) and you have something that will retain its lukewarm appeal only as long as the sociopolitical agenda that drove it remains in play. Normally it would be hard to justify a zero rating for a movie (surely it has some jokes or action scene to give it a few points?) but in this case the deliberate effort to debase the characters, story and basic tone of the previous movies makes it more than suitable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Also, there are sooo many plot holes including Kylo Ren not noticing how Luke was holding the lightsaber that he witnessed getting DESTROYED! Luke could have been way better too, and he died sort of a coward.

Anyhow, I HATED THIS MOVIE from the very beginning when I noticed the social and political statement they were PUSHING from the time the movie started. Now I love to take about politics and social issues. I very much enjoy the a mentally stimulating conversation/discussion about issues of the day but that is why they've made documentaries which I also love to watch.  When one goes to the movies, one is looking to be entertain and especially to escape the issues of the day NOT have them SHOVED down your throat.<br/><br/>I've read many reviews on here and had to write this one due to some of the hypocrisy I read form many men on here. The biggest one was them saying I didn't see gender or didn't see a problem with the OVERTLY and ridiculous exaggeration of gender roles in this movie. Every character who had some importance or level of respect was only a woman. Men were made to seem as not as smart, incompetent and unable to control their emotions a la Luke Skywalker.<br/>This reminded me of people who when confronted with the subject of race first blurt out "I SEE NO COLOR" or " MY BEST FRIEND IS BLACK" such crap!!!<br/>Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with women in positions of power or in leadership roles, if you got it you got it, I'm not into holding back talent BUT this movie and its characters were not about that. I know what I'm saying, I've experience these things as a middle age black man. I know there were arguments in the past about Hollywood not having enough people of color in lead roles or as super heroes as well as women. In my view there has been good and steady progress in both arenas. I have seen good and exciting lead roles and superhero roles played by both people or color (minorities/black) and women alike, that glass ceiling was broken a while ago and there has been steady improvements ever since.<br/>With that said, there was NO REASON to do this and I am willing to bet that this is the main reason why this movie scored so low and I bet it's the lowest scoring Star Wars movie by far.<br/><br/>As far as the other comments about the story lines not making sense and the characters not being developed well I fully agree with. There were too many important characters getting eliminated without their stories, past and roles being developed at all. Snoke for one was killed off too quickly, Captain Phasma just made what amounts to be a cameo appearance, DJ the same could be said for that character, the so called master code breaker, etc.<br/>Bottom line, is this was a poorly executed movie with nothing but a transparent social and political agenda of the day.  The original Star Wars movies NEVER injected the political and social issues of the day in such a disgusting way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

What I hated most was the unflinching willingness of Disney to add characters they think will boost audience engagement--like the Chinese actress. I feel at a real loss for Mark Hamill and he must have nearly choked on his lines. This turd of a production was an insult to the audience and the heritage of the Star Wars legacy.

I honestly thought the opening scene was just a fancy advert for a phone company when Po was messing with the Empire pretending he had a bad connection. I waited in vain and then desprate hope that some flashy logo would appear and then the REAL movie would begin. This is a gut wrenching movie to watch. To witness that the people in charge have so little understanding about what makes this franchise great fills me with fear for the future. To feel that they have so little respect for the inteligence of the audience that they think re-hashing the old scenes and dialogue with a few cute fury characters is enough to warant calling this a new addition to the saga. This movie shamelessly rips off Empire and Return both in the script and visually. The other elements feel rushed and thrown together with boring and pointless character arcs and actions. By any normal movie metric this movie is weak. But the fact that it was so setup for a logical and interesting progression from the Force Awakens it seems like they went out of their way not to pursue any of the threads left by the last movie. The reaction of the public hopefully will be listened to by the studio. We can only hope that Rian Johnson does not direct any more star wars movies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The bad things would be everything else. Where to start...<br/><br/>Probably with the writers' apparent attempt to cramp three movies into one. The Star Wars style of narration still remains a poor fit for rabid modern hollywood pacing. The series is filled with characters and moments that fell short because they just did not have the time to develop. Many scenes required an involvement of the viewer that wasn't there, because the movie never established any meaning for them. They only leave eyes rolling back so hard you can hear it in the audience room. Another fatal flaw with the same result was the overuse of story twists and turnarounds, whose painful predictability completely negates the tension that should have been built.<br/><br/>In this atmosphere, the writers' apparent urge to deliver references to previous Star Wars titles does work out as the loving innuendoes they may have been intended as, but appear as shoehorned in, or as uninspired copies.<br/><br/>And these are far and away not the only things that tore me out of any potential immersion. There are all the usual urges to create big moments that just don't seem to fit and leave a bad aftertaste. There is the pop philosophy tuned to 11, complete with terrible visual metaphors. There is the usual "incompetence as a plot device" in laughable proportions, both with allegedly wise men and basic military protocols (say, how to secure a capital ship).<br/><br/>In the end they somehow managed to cramp material that would have needed 8:00 hours to work out into 2:30h, and still have unbearable lengths in it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

With that said...<br/><br/>THE FOLLOWING IS IN REFERENCE TO THE LARGE SCALE FAN DISCUSSION AND NOT AN OVERALL CRITIQUE OF THE FILM: I've got to be missing something here - perhaps I'm the perfect capture audience for this film but I honestly think it is as good and maybe just maybe better than V and VI. The only complaint I have is exactly why Luke had to die there and then, it seems in one part he has mastered the force and goes of his own will to torment Kylo Ren and it also shows him really struggling with himself. And personally I like the idea that Star Wars is the tale of the Skywalker's but that's a personal wish and I can roll with it if necessary. Apart from that - and the dragged out casino film - I feel the film did alot right. I don't feel any racism was directed at Fin or Rose. My girlfriend believes that Star Wars is ahead of the curve for feminism. I think Luke ever so briefly acts out of character in a couple of scenes but actually acts very human just like he did in Empire and just like Anakin did before him. Luke changed as a result of some incredibly serious personal experiences and changes in the force and I absolutely see how this character 'could' have and did form. I enjoyed the madness of Kylo Ren, it really explains his actions in VII. His torment has literally driven him to moments of pure madness that were played out well. I enjoyed that the big bad was killed off early. I enjoyed Snoke's deception of Rey. I enjoyed Poe being shown as young, naive and missing a trick - his counterplay with the purple hair lady (oops) is great. I enjoyed Leia's use of the force, even if the cinematography wasn't perfect.<br/><br/>I have been a long time fan of the films and what I have read on the Wiki ONLY. I am not a huge Star Wars buff, I just happen to know what has happened around the films. Honestly it really thrilled me. I just feel the need to stand up for the film as a consumer while most of my nerdy comrades are blasting it. From my point of view it was great.﻿</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And really Star Wars the Last Jedi isn't a mess but it is messy. That doesn't mean i didn't like it. In actuality, i really was impressed with what they did with this film. Aside from the Force Awakens and Rouge one, two awful Star Wars movies, this one is actually consistent. Rian Johnson has taken helm of it, which was exciting because i like Rian Johnson. Looper, The three breaking bad episode's he directed, and Brick are great and he did a decent job with this film. Anyway, i want to talk some negative things first, because i need to get all that **** out first. My first negative is with the insanely jarring subplot with Finn and Rose. It felt like it was just there so Rose and Finn had something to do. It was so lazy. Like one of the worst subplots i've seen in a film. No character development during this sequence, and any development that there is, is incredibly lazy and just thrown in there. This is also when we get introduced to Bencio Del Toro's character DJ who is the "master code breaker" Bencio Del Toro is ok in the movie, but the character that was written for him, not so much. He just felt there so that people can go "Ohhhh. A big hollywood movie star" He felt so out of place in this movie. Speaking of **** characters let's talk Rose and Snoke. First Rose. She is there, much like the main subplot, just so she has something to do. She doesn't have much a character and we spend too much time with her. Her stupidity really affect's the movie in a way. Once you see the movie, you'll know what i mean. But she's completely useless. Snoke is also just there. He's there so that Kylo Ren has an arc. His arc is totally forgotten and misused. An opportunity that was completely underused. You have so much ambiguous traits and mysteries with him, that you could lose interest. I never liked snoke, but i wished they delved into his character more. The movie also was surprisingly dumb. This movie has moments where the movie just gets really stupid. Stupid moments that are extremely laughable. And the ending was a bit cheesy. And that's pretty much it. This movie also has force awakens jokes, that made me cringe so hard. Probably as harder than the force awakens. Now positives. The action was really impressive. The space battle's were really awesome. The beginning action scene was really amazing. Made it feel like it was the original Star Wars, It was extremely fantastic. There's a lightsaber battle towards the end of the movie that was **** awesome. Just overall, the action was awesome. Most of the acting was good. Daisy Ridley was fine. Her performance in this movie was equal to her performance in the force awakens. John Boyega is the same. Oscar Isaac is also fine. Carrie Fisher is extraordinary. Her last  performance is her best performance. Adam Driver is amazing as Kylo Ren once again. Andy Serkis is chilling as Snoke. Even though his character is **** dumb. Laura Dern is decent. I didn't care for her character because they did nothing with her character. Mark Hamil is stunning as bitter Luke. He was amazing in this movie. The best he's ever been as Luke. The characters are really built in this movies, they has clear and perfect arcs. Rey is more developed and more perfected in this movie. Poe has my favourite arc in the movie. His arc was really built throughout the movie.  Finn has really confusing arc. Kylo Ren has a amazing arc. You see every thing that this character has gone through. Already his character is extremely fascinating and can't wait to see what they do with this character. Leia is great, like always. In the force awakens, her character was there for, what it felt like, nostalgia. But her character here is really good. What i heard, is that Luke's character was awful, and that it ruined their childhood. I thought Luke was great. His bitter character was really cool. Seeing Luke as a bitter, brutal, old man was reeling. The first act and the last act are really great. But all that second act stuff with the casino, Rose and Finn, is really bad. But overall the story is fine. The direction and cinematography are amazing and great. And the special effects are stunning as well. The music is fine, but still feels kinda rushed. Like the force awakens where the music is just really awful, the music is just fine here. Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is decent, enough for me to like it. Where they go with the Star Wars series is really fascinating, and i can't wait to see where the new franchise go's.<br/><br/>73%</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie was still somewhat entertaining, carried by Adam Driver's incredible performance as Kylo Ren, but it left a lot to be desired. Plot holes, poor dialogue, incohesive story - this is a bad movie on a more fundamental level, in addition to being a huge disappointment as far as Star Wars fandom. It's almost as if The Force Awakens doesn't even exist - The Last Jedi did little to nothing to develop any of the new triology's characters. Some of the scenes ("Carrie Poppins" floating through space) and dialogue exchanges (Rose to Finn after saving him) were more cringe-inducing than anything I saw in the prequels, which I didn't even think was possible. The bar for this movie was not that high, but unfortunately Rian Johnson and co did not meet it, and it's a damn shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7921405"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Cultural marxism promotes post modern moral relativism as being progressive, whilst rejecting moral absolutism as being old fashioned, quaint or part of some patriarchal conspiracy. In reality, polarisation toward the light (or dark) is the very essence of spiritual evolution for third density incarnated souls. The polarisation provides the necessary catalyst for dualistic conflict and eventual resolution. Recognition and acceptance of the light and dark within ourselves is not the same thing as giving in to this supposed stalemate and accepting the ‘greyness’ of being. We’re supposed to strive for one extreme or the other. Obviously, only a very small minority strive towards the dark ‘service to self’ path.<br/><br/>Why am I talking about this on a TLJ review? Well, the OT became so popular because at its core was this spiritual reality. People are starving for spiritual meaning and these movies tapped into this in a big way. It couldn’t have been any clearer who the good and bad guys were. The music would tell you if nothing else. The makers of The Last Jedi, however, have rejected this established approach to story telling within the SW universe. Instead they’ve produced a morally ambiguous mess.<br/><br/>As interesting as Kreia was in KOTOR II, a grey Jedi is not something to aspire to. I certainly wasn’t one of these people who wanted to see Luke that way as it wouldn’t have made any sense given his existing story arc in the OT. Maybe Abrams can resolve the central relationship between Rey and Kylo satisfactorily in the next instalment, but its to who’s satisfaction I’m worried about. Given what I said above, I don’t think this is a good thing and is part of a wider agenda throughout Hollywood and other forms of entertainment to morally confuse people under the guise of being ‘progressive’. Obviously there will be people who agree with this assessment and those who disagree. I’ve just tried to offer one explanation to those people who love this, admittedly, visually stunning movie why many huge SW fans, including myself, despise it. The plot holes, pacing, dumb and jarring humour, bad characterisation etc. that have most often been mentioned as reasons for disliking the movie are not really likely to illicit such strong feelings. I would suggest that its more to do with a conscious or subconscious recognition of this rejection of traditional archetypal story telling within the movie. This is by no means unique to this movie and has become widespread in recent years. This 'blurring of the lines' is a modern curse.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with the movie is the character assassination of Luke. The obvious deliberate deconstruction of one of the most positive male archetypal characters of the last 50 years within popular culture is a cultural marxist’s wet dream. It had to be deliberate as there’s no way this was the absolute best way they could come up with to end his story. This was clearly going to enrage the fans of the OT so why do it? Perhaps, to make Rey look more positive in comparison or to provide a backstory for how Kylo turned to the dark side, albeit in a nonsensical and completely uncharacteristic fashion. Whichever way you look at it, the character deserved a whole lot better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7963608"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">There are so many problems and disappointments with the Last Jedi that there isn't enough space to write. However, I will try to focus on most obvious. The movie was awful from a plot basis and understanding of the lore, mythology and history of Star Wars canon. It's as if Johnson never viewed the previous 6 movies or read any of the novels or Star Wars myths. Here are the central problems:<br/>1. Luke Skywalker was willing to die in ROTJ to turn his father to the light side. So powerful and good was he that Darth Vader, who had killed Jedi students, turned to the light and destroyed the Sith, bringing balance to the force. The only Jedi left to continue this religion was Luke. Apparently, we learn in TFA, that Ben Solo turned on Luke because of a dark side master, Snoke. We don't know how Snoke rose, whether he is a Sith, just a bad guy, whatever. And it appears with his baseless death that we never will. If you thought Snoke might be Plagueis or something more interesting or thought you would learn more about the religion of the Sith and Jedi you will be very humiliated. In fact, here's what you learn. Snoke is a weak nobody who is easily killed by Kylo without even a confrontation. Basically, Snoke tells Kylo to complete his training and kill Rey and then Kylo uses the force to turn a light saber sitting next to Snoke through his side. What makes this scene so stupid is that moments before his death, Snoke is throwing Rey all over the room like a gorilla could do to a cat. And after briefly striking Kylo with lighting earlier in the film, Snoke apparently can do everything but use his peripheral vision to see a light saber clearly moving next to his side. Did anyone review this movie before its release? Then, Rey's parents are drunks who have no power. And Luke...oh God, Luke Skywalker...perhaps the greatest Jedi of all, milks and alien and drinks the milk like a homeless man. He has no power and is easily dispensed of by Rey, who has as much training with the force as you and I do...and then in the climactic scene in the movie...Luke dies at the hands of exhaustion from using a hologram of himself to fight Ren. Think you've heard enough...hang on...the force ghost of Yoda appears to Luke--he looks like Kermit the Frog...and he burns the Jedi teachings and says about the Jedi books--and I'm not kidding here--"they are not exactly page turners..." Then, after Yoda uses forces lighting to burn the Jedi teachings he laughs hysterically." Clearly, in death, Yoda is not the same 900 year old Jedi who tells Luke that he's trained Jedi for 800 years and knows better than he...My God. This is just the surface. Leia, the only really dead person in the movie, survives, which means we all know her fate already in 9. And there is a scene where she is blown from a ship and uses the force to fly back to the ship like Marry Poppins! All she needed was the umbrella...And finally, the political agenda stuff is so thrown in your face you feel like you're watching MSNBC. And, I'm a progressive. It was just too obvious. The myth of the Jedi and Sith is dead. The characters we thought we knew are destroyed and in one movie the only story we have left to tell is of a petulant, cry-baby, impulsive loser, Kylo Ren. Star Wars has ended. And it was clearly intentional.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

"We are the spark that lights up the rebellion." Oh please, I wanted to violently vomit at that point. It's worth mentioning that I hate the Hunger Games more than most. Unlike most of the pissed-off star wars fans, I didn't actually mind that Rey's parents were nobodies, because I think it's plausible that she is simply extremely force-sensitive. Having said that, I don't think gets to understanding most of what there is to learn about the force in a mere two minutes, when it took Luke Skywalker an entire trilogy. That is simply too unrealistic, and it's lazy storytelling. As for the story, it was too long, if that is a valid criticism of a story. And yet, it was too short, in detailing Rey's Jedi training, at the hands of Luke. Dialogues were god-awful, every single damn character, with the exception of Oscar isaac maybe, were delivering their lines as if they were the most goddamn important things on earth. The overdramaticism killed me. The first order was as laughably incompetent as in TFA, and not incompetent in terms of power and resources, but in terms of general effect. Sorry Bill Weasley, but Hux kinda sux, and sorry Snoke, you need to get a less glittery jacket. I thought the whole Luke-Rey-Kylo Ren dynamic worked out pretty well, and as usual, the ship fight scenes were too long. I would have given this movie 5 stars, also, if it weren't for the goddamn owly-things on Luke's island whose only purpose was to sell some more merch for Disney. Damnit! I don't think this review contains any spoilers, so I won't check the box. Actually, I think I will, just to be safe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It’s now Friday. I’ve had a few days to collect my thoughts. This was the biggest disappointment of my movie going life. This is the worse SW film ever made. Now before you think I’m whining that it didn’t turn out like I thought it would, let me just say, I expected it to be different than any preconceived notions or ideas that i may have had... I enjoy that. I want to be surprised. I didn’t need Luke flying over the screen against a 1000 storm troopers to be happy. What I needed was good writing. That’s it.  I’m actually a film producer, not on the scale of SW, but I make movies, and I know the process of creating a story for audiences and how difficult it is to do it well. Rian Johnson not only betrayed the SW franchise but he is a terrible writer. Terrible. I’m sorry. Maybe he’s a nice guy. But how he ruined this beloved franchise is inexcusable. The entire story takes place over the course of about 12-24 hours, something like that, and is essentially one long chase scene. Except The chase only “works” if you change the rules... to a preposterous set of rules to where light speed is a weapon (which should have been used at other times because it’s sooooo effective), shields that are basically indestructible, sensors that can’t see smaller ships that are right in front of them, it’s a chase but it’s conceivably the slowest chase in history... it’s just soooo stupid, and that’s just the chase scene. Every facet of this movie makes no sense. Kilo now is the big baddie but he’s already lost to Rey so he’s not menacing at all. Rey has no arc. She has no progression. Luke’s character, who saw the good in his dad, refuses to kill him, and even lays down his life in front of the emperor for truth and righteousness, is now a weirdo who almost murders his nephew, well at least thought about it, is a whiner, and worthless. It’s not a gotch’a look how creative I am... it’s stupid weak writing. It’s inconsistent.  Such a travesty what they did to Mark’s character. For the  people think that RJ is a genius for switching things up, i submit this, why doesn’t the next director of the James Bond franchise make his character into a Harry Potter wizard-like character because that would be so bold and cutting edge! They won’t because it’s idiotic and stupid. But that is what RJ did. He took everything that Lucas built, and every setup from JJ and threw it over his shoulder like a piece of trash (just like Luke). It wasn’t inventive. It was weak. I don’t even care about the back story of snoke or Rey... that ultimately doesn’t matter. What matters is struggle, the dynamics, between characters. And the most evil of evil now in this franchise is two white skinny males who are whinny brats who have already been bested. So going into episode 9 there is no suspense... no weight, because we know those two idiots will fail, because they have already failed. The emperor kept winning until his pride didn’t see the spark of goodness of Vader... that was his downfall. All was lost until Vader decided one time to do good. Very powerful. Right now we have the weakest setup for a new movie ever in a big franchise. Such stupidity by RJ and Kennedy. I could have put my team together of writers and producers, and made a film that would have been awesome yet unpredictable and satisfying for fans and new commers. I would have respected the franchise instead of crapping all over it. Thanks RJ for nothing. Unreal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I am not a bot no matter what Disney would like to tell you.<br/><br/>Here are my beefs:<br/><br/>1. Luke Skywalker is a different character than the original movies. If you want to have a character arc where he changes and becomes a hermit fine, but you NEED TO SHOW IT. I did not buy that he would have tried to kill Ben Solo since he exhibited the slightest amount of darkness. Remember he threw his light saber down and would not fight against Darth Freaking Vader and the emperor so he could save him. How am I expected to believe that he is now a completely opposite person? This is the same guy who told the emperor: "You're Wrong, I am a Jedi, Like my father before me."<br/><br/>2. Rey is now all of a sudden a Jedi because what, She meditated on a rock for about 2 minutes? That is all of the training she needs to become a Jedi? She is after all a strong confident woman so the rules don't apply. Luke was on Degobah for months and he was still not ready to face Vader and escaped by the skin of his teeth. She is the biggest Mary Sue in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>3. Apparently you can breath in space now. (See Leia/Bomber Pilot - Also there is no gravity in space so how did she "drop" the bombs?)<br/><br/>4. Leia turning into Mary Poppins was the worst thing I have ever seen in a movie, any movie, EVER. Also, no one on the ship is sucked out after the door is opened, neither do they find it in the least bit curious that she survived the vacuum of space. She also has exactly ZERO Jedi training or any training with the force whatsoever but now she can use it to do **** that Luke Skywalker was never able to do?<br/><br/>5. Snoke - What the hell is his back story, where did he come from and how did he create the first order? No need to explain any of that, just go ahead and kill him.<br/><br/>6. What the hell did Luke die from? Meditating too hard?<br/><br/>7. Luke sucking on the tit of some engorged sea cow. WTF?<br/><br/>8. So Snoke can control and read the mind of Kilo Ren but he does not anticipate that Kilo Ren was about to kill him? WTF?<br/><br/>9. The whole plot about the rebels trying to stay out of range of the first order ships was so so so so so stupid and unbelievable. You mean to tell me that the first order does not have any other ships that could track them down? Also when you are in space you DO NOT NEED FUEL to keep going! And can you remember any other time in Star Wars movies where the had to pull over to gas up?<br/><br/>10. The whole Finn/Rose storyline was a complete waste of time. Rose is the worst character since Jar Jar Binks. I think they just added her to show another minority on the screen and for her to scream about how awful rich and white people are. She serves no other purpose. The blatant feminism and SJW crap in this movie is so out of place. All men are portrayed as bumbling idiots or evil (or both) and all women are amazing and can do nothing wrong, need no training to use the force, and are so much smarter than men.<br/><br/>11. Laura Dern had perhaps the worst acting performance I have ever seen in any movie. She comes off as some super soft "just happy to be here" person and we are expected to believe she is some bad ass general/admiral. Also she had this secret plan to save everyone. Why the hell was it secret? She invited a mutiny since she was secret for no reason.<br/><br/>12. Rose saving Finn at the last second was so dumb, so so dumb. And she falls in love in 5 hours? Him saving the day would have saved the movie to some extent. I am still rolling my eyes from her stupid line about saving what we love or some bull**** like that. We have gone from "I Love You" - "I Know" to this crap!<br/><br/>13. Apparently on the casino planet you get thrown in jail if you park in the wrong place. Plus this whole sub-plot was just Twitter Social Warrior Justice bull**** being thrown in our face. I am in a dark theater to watch a movie and be entertained not preached at. Call me a sexist pig and bad person if you want to feel better about yourself but this whole part of the movie was worthless.<br/><br/>14. So, I am not sure that Disney realized they were making a Star Wars movie. I  think they think Star Wars is a comedy franchise.<br/><br/>15. What was the point of the penguin things on the island other than to sell merchandise?<br/><br/>16. What was the point of The Force Awakens? This movie took all of the questions raised in that movie and decided they were not important at all and just threw them out the window. That was the saving grace of TFA is that it raised some questions to be answered in later movies.<br/><br/>17. Kilo is Emo Darth Vader.<br/><br/>I am not sure that Star Wars is salvageable at this point as long as Disney owns the rights. I will enjoy the original trilogy always and the prequels were not as bad as they were made out to be but I think I am done at this point. This movie was a giant middle finger to the original trilogy and people who grew up with STAR WARS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The latest movie is absolutely lacking the heart and soul of Star Wars. The plot is so convoluted and several events take place that should make you question numerous events not just in this movie but also in past movies too. Just massive plot holes. The Last Jedi completely tramples the lore of Star Wars. The mythos, the "facts," the importance of Star Wars and its past. The performances are well done, individual moments and scenes are amazing even, and overall the movie cinematically looks great. However, as a whole package, it does not work because several of the most important components of any good movie are missing. For Last Jedi, it is story, heart, impact to certain character's motivations. I am avoiding spoilers but nearly step by step, scene by scene, anyone could rip this movie apart. Literally, "THAT MAKES NO SENSE!" Consider Vice Admiral Holdo's impact to the movie for a moment, why wasn't this "trick" done over and over again in space combat? Why not against the Death Stars? Why was the trench run even needed then? There are other examples but attempting to avoid spoilers as previously stated.<br/><br/>I greatly fear for the entirety of the Star Wars Saga. At this point, I can definitely say I miss George Lucas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The battle scenes were great. Lots of action and explosions. The opening bombing scene was tense and attention-grabbing. Watching Rey and Kylo Ren fight all of Snoke's bodyguards was awesome. Yoda's short appearance was spectacular - was a fun reminder of Luke's original training with him. Other than that, the movie was underwhelming and disappointing. They tried WAY too hard to insert dumb humor all over the movie, and it fell flat. It wasn't funny. They were stupid one-liners that honestly made me cringe. I can honestly say that at least Episodes I-III retained the same type of Star Wars tone that the original trilogy had. "The Last Jedi" completely threw out all remnants of the tone and culture of the original Star Wars trilogy. I honestly couldn't take the movie seriously because of how much humor they tried to insert. The sequence of Rey following around Luke had to be one of the dumbest things I've ever watched. And Mark Hamill is correct, they ruined Luke's character, and then to ice the cake, they killed him. Luke's character was incredibly boring, apathetic, and hopeless. He comes back at the end and helps the rebels escape, but it doesn't redeem his character. One little scene at the end cannot redeem how poorly they portrayed his character throughout the entire movie. If that's how you're going to portray one of the greatest Jedi Masters of all time, then just stop making the movies, because you're wasting everyone's time. Questions that have been left unanswered that make this whole trilogy bad: Who is Snoke and how did he come to power? How did the First Order come to power after Return of the Jedi? Who is Rey? How did the Republic become so weak and defenseless even after defeating the Empire? How did Leia not die, and how do you force-propel yourself through space while unconscious? There are so many more questions I could pose that poke so many holes through the plot and writing of The Last Jedi. Overall, the movie completely lost touch with what Star Wars is all about - the tone, the writing, the culture, the storylines, the structure, etc. The Last Jedi did not feel like a Star Wars movie, which if it's not going to, then why put the name "Star Wars" on it? The humor was ill-timed and ill-advised. The film dragged out for way too long. There were pointless scene-sequences and pointless characters. Ok, there are my thoughts. Bad movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Despite some terrible CGI scenes. Awkward humour and ridiculous plot twists and directions. The trip to the gambling planet was laced with the same terrible CGI and pointless alien characters found in Episodes 1 to 3. Yet if anyone likes the original Trilogy or any of the characters prepared to have them destroyed. Apparently, he has been given free reign to create a new Trilogy separate from the original characters. Why he decided to character assassinate one of the heroes in sci-fi film history is beyond me. A complelety nihilistic take on anything related to Star Wars. I'm not a fanboy. I grew up with the originals and loved those films. I thought episodes 1 to 3 were absolutely terrible. I liked The Force Awakens and I thought Rogue One was excellent. This film has killed the franchise for me. Really don't care what happens in the next. If you like Star Wars, save yourself the money and time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are huge cringe worthy, logic defying moronic moments that even a toddler could point out. Add to that all the useless moments that ended with nothing or all the set up from the previous movie that was just utterly discarded. If you want to make it for all audiences, go ahead, but you can still make it a story that holds up.

Both science fiction fantasies suffer from static characters meandering through uninteresting storylines encumbered by numerous plot holes that are surpassed only by the sheer amount of absolutely stunning visuals that the producers were hoping would be enough to supersede the complete lack of cinematic substance.    One of these films will be remembered for all time.  The other would be forgotten weeks after its release.  One of these films made profitable gains after one week.  The other was a financial disaster.  One of them is preceded in its title by Star Wars.  And that’s the only real difference.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

When watching it at the cinema it was easy to get swept along for the ride and I can’t say I wasn’t at least somewhat entertained overall. Unfortunately The Last Jedi simply has too many faults to be considered a great, or even good, movie. Even as someone who is only a minor fan of the franchise I was severely disappointed with the handling of Luke Skywalkers character (he does little but mope around for much of the running time) and the awkward attempts to add some “Marvel” style humour to proceedings not only fell flat but often undermined key events. The number of plot holes, even by the standards of a sci-fi movie, is also staggering. I won’t list them all here, there are plenty of YouTube videos and websites that’ll take you through them all if you so wish, but it’s hard to believe a whole team of writers failed to see so many issues.<br/><br/>If you’re looking for a narratively coherent movie you’re looking in the wrong place, particularly if you’re a big fan of the franchise, but there is some entertainment to be had if you’re willing to just go along with whatever the movie throws at you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The very opening. We go from a Republic though with problems it has been established. The fringe group would be the First Order. We SKIP over the entire story of the downfall of the Republic to where we started off in 4/5/6.<br/>2. Where did the First Order get the money to pay for stuff AFTER the catastrophe of losing their death star? I know it wasn’t a death star but come on… it was a death star. They did not have financial outreach like the Empire did when the actual first and second death stars were built.<br/>3. No character development = no story<br/>4. Additional pointless characters – the vice admiral to name one<br/>5. **** on every dramatic moment with comedy<br/>6. Copies story lines from 4/5/6<br/>7. Take the first scene with Poe and replace it with Anakin Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, or even Hann Solo and you have the exact same scenes we say 2 – 6.<br/>8. Leia’s powers were not established nor was her ability in the movie to move through space explained. You have to have read legends to know what is LIKELY what power she used.<br/>9. Luke’s battle with Kylo was like the Obi Wan and Vader fight with it ending similarly. This may have been for dramatic effect but it was undercut as well and just lazy writing. A new way would have been more powerful.<br/>10. They **** on the Jedi with disregard to all of their teachings.<br/>11. Luke’s reasoning for giving up on Kylo and then everyone else makes no sense for his movie character.<br/>12. Snoke was built up to be some super powerful being and then is just easily killed. You do realize they flex his ability in the force to show his strength and then undercut it by him not sensing Kylo’s betrayal right? Sidious was about to sense Vader’s changes in nearly all encounters when it happened. Sidious used a blade because of it being a crap on the Jedi but he himself was a force user primarily like Snoke supposedly was. The movie made Snoke so weak, and subsequently Kylo, that it is easy to argue that Sidious or Vader or maybe even Tyranus could have defeated Snoke with little effort. Legends:<br/><br/>1. The Death Star was actually IN CANON established with Tarkin and Thrawn of costing a LOT of money. It was established that Grand Admiral Tarkin, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and Lord/Darth Vader were all fairly against it. Tarkin did take over and come to the side with the Emperor on it. If I am remembering it all correctly. For sure Thrawn and Vader were not for it. Why? Because it weakened the overall Navy because it cost so much they had to deviate from building other vessels like Star Destroyers and Super Star Destroyers which could cover more of space. Then it cost a LOT to build the second Death Star. So I ask you, WHERE did the First Order get the finances to make their own when the Empire struggled to pay it and they had a near entire galaxy paying for it?!?!?!<br/>2. The ability Leia used could be a force meditation which I found in Star Wars Specter of the Past and was used by Luke. It explains why she couldn’t open the door to get.<br/>3. The little fat animals are similar to Jar Jar. I liked Jar Jar and everyone hated him. They love the little ****. This bothers me.<br/>4. In the novels you get to learn what brought the downfall of the new Jedi, the New Republic, and the fall of many heroes. Why was that just hopped over?<br/>5. Why did we get literally near scene for scene and/or plot for plot 4/5/6 and some from 1/2/3 when there are so many stories to tell? My username is a call to a character in one such novel. You could talk about Bane who was made canon which likely means the old Sith are canon which could have been talked about. What about Plagueis or his master Tenebrous? What about stories that made Maul the actual character he was like Maul Lockdown? What about the Old Sith Wars, Mandalorian Wars, or the Yuuzhan Vong wars? What about exploring the good in the Empire by its soldiers like in Twilight Company? So many ORIGINAL stories and yet we got a copy and paste update.<br/>6. By weaponizing the hyperspace jumps etc it severely hurts or gets rid of the importance of some features of the Super Star Destroyers and the ENTIRE LINE of Interdictor – class Star Destroyer. Furthermore, why in the movie was an Interdictor – class Star Destroyer not used to simply trap the rebels so that they could only use their fuel on their ships and have no way of entering hyper space at all? This would have made what the Vice Admiral did not able to happen. (‘-’)/ if we are going to give them a Death Star then I cannot see why a much cheaper Star Destroyer would be out of the question in the movie logic.<br/><br/>I am sure there is more that I am missing but at the moment these are the key things I could think of and remember.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Let's start with the fact that it completely invalidates not only everything that happened in the original series, but also everything that happened IN THE LAST MOVIE!! (Which was equally terrible, by the way). So much for destroying the Empire and restoring freedom and peace in the galaxy. And Luke's character assassination in this movie is borderline criminal. They took one of the most iconic characters ever created and turned him into a cynical loser who's behavior makes no sense whatsoever. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say I am no longer interested in any new productions in this franchise. I regret the time I wasted watching this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If not, you'll probably like it.<br/>It's better than Attack of the Clones, but that's not meant as high praise.<br/>The storyline with Kylo Ren and Luke is believable and brilliantly done, and his relationship with Rey is well executed too.  But that's only one of about 4 storylines in the film and the rest are garbage.  Finn goes from being one of the funniest, most charismatic characters in Force Awakens to a bland space eater generic supporting hero.  It's also full of plot holes and squanders some of the most interesting characters that the last film introduced, not to mention the most boring chase sequence I've ever watched.<br/>My girlfriend, who had never seen Star Wars before we started dating liked it.  It made me furious, and it's probably the only Star Wars movie that I won't return to see a second time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Last Jedi is a hot steaming pile of crap. Unlikeable new characters, plot holes the size of the Death Star and a meandering half baked script is what sealed the fate for this potentially great film. JJ had set up RJ for an easy lay up/slam dunk after the TFA, and yet RJ somehow manages to alienate half the SW fanbase and make a completely non sensical SW film. Director RJ has managed to defile 40 years of Star Wars history and traditions in one fell swoop. Not even the stellar performance of Adam Driver can save this film from the garbage compactor. The Last Jedi is akin to the Phasma character, a lot of hype, with very little payoff and ultimately hugely disappointing and disrespectful. This movie has no respect for what came before it, and "That is why it failed." - Yoda</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke Skywalker is not the same character we grew to follow in the original films and I completely understand Mark Hamill's disappointment about how was written. I can't equate the daydreaming farmboy from Tattooine with a grumpy old man living on a rock in the middle of nowhere. The Leia spacewalk drew groans from the audience, as did the cow-milking scene. Snoke was killed cheaply before we even knew anything about him, as was Phasma. The resistance is basically dead now; the 30 surviving people on the millenium falcon with no military hardware are not anything you would call a threat worth bothering about, so the first order have already won. There seemed to be a lot of diversity box-ticking with regard to the casting (in real life the resistance would be like any military organisation in history - young men going off to fight given orders by old men). I also found it noticeable that the first order was all caucasian, in stark contrast to the much more diverse resistance. I wonder what the reaction would have been if this had been the other way round. There were lots of plots holes. Overall I enjoyed waiting to see what would happen, the set pieces were very well done as were the effects. I feel kylo ren and rey's character's were progressed well, if nobody else. I don't think it's the movie it could, and indeed, should have been considering it was Luke's finale, Han Solo is already dead and Carrie Fisher has sadly passed on. Just feel they deserved something better than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I was extremely happy when Disney obtained the rights for Star Wars because I thought it would be more Star Wars and because Disney usually does an outstanding job with its products. However, I grew up loving Star Wars and Luke Skywalker because Luke would never give up on his father no matter how terrible his father was. But for some reason, Luke no longer had that faithful determination that was the key to his growth in the Original Trilogy. It was obvious that Disney killed off Luke just so they could more easily expand the Star Wars Universe to make more money. They could have done it in a far better way by making him go out showing his true power and saving his friends. How this was not thought of is amazing. Not giving Luke a final amazing lightsaber duel is asinine. The greatest Star War war character ever was treated like a burdensome character to deal with and so they just did away with him unceremoniously. I understand that I am upset because of how they handled Luke Skywalker and not upset with the quality of the movie itself. However, I think that my rating is appropriate because the source material for the movie was almost entirely disregarded (except for the facts that there are outer space scenes and the Force is involved in the story). If the Lord of the Rings was given a new Trilogy and that trilogy made Aragorn a feeble, depressed character then many fans would freak out on that issue as well.<br/><br/>I am so confounded on how Rian Johnson came to the conclusion that Luke Skywalker would act in the way he did in The Last Jedi. Even Mark Hammill thought his character in The Last Jedi wasn't true to form. The worst part of all is that Disney and Johnson are saying that the divisiveness The Last Jedi has caused is a positive thing. If you are losing half of your fan base how can that possibly be a good thing? It may be sad to some people that I can be so upset about a movie, but Star Wars was such a large part of my childhood (and my adulthood) that tarnishing so many of those happy memories for me if hard to move past. I will no longer be going to Disney after this year. The only reason I am still going this year is because I paid for tickets, a room, and a meal plan before The Last Jedi was released to theaters. Even though I love Disney, I cannot support a company that would so recklessly destroy a source of happiness for so many people. Hopefully Luke Skywalker isn't dead and just found a way to transport himself through the Force to different locations. That's the only hope I have that Star Wars may not be ruined for good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Leaving aside any Star Wars expectations (I'm fine with something completely different) here are the issues:<br/><br/>- Too many characters, not enough character. With about 8 main characters not including our protaganist, there isn't any time for character development.<br/>- Having its cake and eating it. There are several moments when something dramatic happens, only for the reveal that it didn't actually happen. By the end I didn't care about anything happening because they killed the impact of any events by reversing everything that happened previously.<br/>- Pointless side-plots that went nowhere. You can actually cut every scene with Finn & Rose, and it would make literally no difference to the plot. Nothing they do affects the film in any way.<br/><br/>As for Star Wars specific criticisms:<br/>- Jedi training is now meaningless. Anyone born with the force can throw stuff around and fly without training.<br/>- Kamakazi ship attacks that make every Death Star plot meaningless now, why didn't they just hyperspace fly a ship into the Death Star?<br/><br/><br/>This film doesn't work as its own thing, and it doesn't work as a Star Wars film. How critics can be praising this crap after the treatment they gave Blade Runner 2049 is a mystery to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

To the point. Those comic relief moments, my God I died on the inside. I cringed so many times I started to nervously laugh and I was not the only one. People at the cinema were laughing in serious moments. Then I started to treat this film like a parody. Luke - they destroyed this character. Ok I understand that he felt bad for what happened, I can understand his bitterness but I thought he will be back in action. Nah, let’s make him look weak several times, then let’s make the audience believe that actually he’s back and will fight, but right away with a really ridiculous scene let’s destroy the hope. That „taking dirt of the shoulder” move made me really dead inside. Somebody watched Goldeneye scene with the tank when James Bond wrecks the city and afterwards adjusts his tie like a boss. It was cool, but it is not cool in Star Wars final battle for God’s sake, it’s cringe.   The finale really makes me believe that Mark didn’t know what is going to happen with Luke, and that he hated the script. Rey - again she knows everything, Mary Sue style. I actually hoped she will turn to the dark side. It would save that movie for me, but well I don’t really care for her. Kylo - a little better than in TFA, I actually started to like this character. I also hoped that him turning back to the light side of the force is an option that would be quite cool. Imagine Kylo and Rey training together with Luke’s guidance to defeat Snoke. Not in my dreams.<br/><br/>Finn and Rose - what was that about? 45 minutes of an unnecessary plot with the casino that was not completely Star Wars vibe. And this message „capitalism and gambling is bad”. Seriously Disney? Hypocrisy is strong with you. The final battle…well done Rose, you almost destroyed the Resistance because you had a crush on Mr Useless Character. I laughed hard when she said this cringy line about love. Snoke - what a wasted potential. We still don’t know anything about him and that makes the whole film even more stupid. I don’t care if they explained in the new books. You won’t see my money. Leia - Mary Poppins scene was stupid looking and she lacked logic when being in charge. Poe - the only person that had guts but at the same time they made him look like irresponsible child that needs spanking from mama purple hair and mama Leia. Men suck, don’t we? BB-8 - loved him as before, but it’s really not enough to make me give a better rating Chewie - didn’t do anything basically, why is he even still around?<br/><br/>Resistance and First Order’s leaders - oh boy oh boy. Disney, you made them look like a bunch of kids. This purple hair lady was the worst SW character ever. And why was she wearing a ball gown? She should’ve been dressed in a black funeral dress, that would be adequate. Ah and now only women are in charge, yeah cool. First Order’s leaders also weak, noncharismatic. You remember Tarkin, Veers, Piett? I respected them even if they were the bad guys. Alliance’s generals Dodona, Riekaan, Maidine, Ackbar (why is he dead? Really?), Mon Mothma - all cool characters also developed in EU. I know it’s not the old trilogy, I know people need new things and we need to move on, but at least make them charismatic and strong. So yeah cool, because of your decisions Rebellion is like 10 people now. I cringed so hard and I just wanted them all die, didn’t care for them anymore. The whole space chase was the stupidest thing. I didn't know the shields on a capital ship are that strong lol, they've been firing all the time at it and it seemed that it was invulnerable, but earlier during the battle it wasn't? What about the fuel? Capital ships had reactors from what I remember. Oh what a bad luck that you ran out of gas. Jumping to hyperspace? Nah, they will track us. Why not jump closer to the planet, disembark on a smaller carriers set the autopilot or leave a frikkin droid to ram the star destroyer. I felt like watching Prometheus. I cringed because of crew's lack of common sense there too. So I guess I’m done with new Star Wars. Will watch Empire Strikes Back as an antidotum as I really feel bad after watching TLJ.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Like most modern superhero movies, anything can be destroyed and anyone can be killed with little fanfare or emotional impact.  Things blow up and the cast moves on without really looking back.  Nothing is ever really at stake.  This felt more like a Harry Potter or Hunger Games movie than Star Wars.

So where does an average person fall into the mix? It's definitely a good movie but not as great as I had expected based on what the critics had said. Between some of the very odd decisions that were revealed to have been made by alot of the characters (most notably Luke) and the very slow middle portion of the movie, it felt like things dragged on a bit too much for my liking. I also don't agree with the fact that this was a pseudo-ending for the movies. There's very clearly going to be a 3rd and final one for this set of the movies and they set up for it fairly well. I just don't feel like the movie set things in motion very well with some of the storylines that came out of it. Of course the most obvious one was pushed to a new limit going forward (no spoilers....) but the other main part of the story just never really clicked the entire time and felt like nothing was accomplished. I wish I could say more but even just starting to talk about it would give it away and ruin the experience. It's certainly not a bad movie by any means. Yes it does take alot of liberties with some tried and true characters, and makes them seems fairly weak in response to those choices. But the movie itself was a good time. It felt very similar to how Empire did for the IV-VI movies. This is the transition movie for this part of the storyline. And while I'm sure people don't like how polarizing it ended up being, it did its part I feel like. I personally liked The Force Awakens and even Rogue One more then this one, but didn't feel like it dropped the ball like alot of hardcore fanboys have felt like.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And this is through no lack of amazing cinematography, score, or ever great battle scenes or individual duels but there were a few things that put me off and most of them are on the character development. Without going into spoiler mode I refrain from taking about then just yet. This does not make it a bad movie though, but just one that is not a brilliant as some others.  I still think that certain fans and newcomers may still largely enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
