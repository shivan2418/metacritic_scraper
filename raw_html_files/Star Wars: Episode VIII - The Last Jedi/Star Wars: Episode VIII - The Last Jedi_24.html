The Last Jedi happens to be another addition to this nauseating trend. Here is my review: The Last Jedi is a lackluster, disappointing movie. Horrendous flat characters, unnecessary side plot, and contains poor dialogue. Yup, that’s Disney’s Star Wars for you! Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy definitely ruined our beloved, special franchise. If you don't see the flaws in this film, I assume you prefer quantity, not quality, Star Wars movies. 0/10 from me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

You get over 150 min of pure, pointless nonsense. If this was running on tv and didn't had the Star Wars name, you would turn this **** off after 20 min tops. Because it's just filler, disneyfied to an extend thats even insulting for actual Disney movies.<br/><br/>The story was almost completely predictable and filled with bull****. For me as a imperial fan, this was just more than 150min of pure agony. And even my rebel buddy sitting next to me was facepalming every few minutes, only interupted by starring in disbelief at the screen.<br/><br/>But let's talk about a few points of this movie that were just complete crap. 5000 characters are not enough to describe the mess. 500000 would even barely be enough.<br/><br/>At the beginning it's said that the first order has nearly wiped out all of the resistance. And then shortly before they can deal the deceisive blow, all officers go suddenly braindead. Allowing a single **** fighter to disable the 2. most powerful ship of the order singlehandedly. And then a few bombers come and destroy it..... While every other ship of the fleet is watching......and no more fighters are deployed....and nobody is firing at the rebels anymore.....and somebody forgot to bring an interdictor cruiser.....<br/><br/>The first order then tails the fleeing rebels and manages to detet them falling from hyperspace. The rebels can only run, since their fuel is almost depleted and they almost get wiped out by enemy fighters. Instead of finishing them off, the order decided to follow them.....without sending additional fighter to attack them....and waiting for them to run out of fuel....and without calling in reinforcements to block their escape route......<br/><br/>And when they finally were about to destroy the last rebel ship and end the rebellion, guess who pulls out a super weapon out of their asses? And it's a weapon they could have come up with centuries ago.....<br/><br/>Seriously, this movie is almost on level with episode 2. Go spend your hard earned money on a pizza. Or a handjob from a crack whore. In both cases more satisfying experiences than this gigantic pile of disney ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Some of them willfully so. This is a movie about guilt and doubt and fear, much like The Empire Strikes Back. Yet it also progresses the thematic content of the Star Wars franchise.<br/><br/>The reveal of Rey's parents is not just the writer/director trolling the audience, this has an important message. The idea that Star Wars should be about a super special lineage is extremely problematic. The idea that the Force is the power that connects everything is antithetical to this kind of power and authority through succession mentality. It's this very mentality, combined with his nature as a rageaholic bloodthirsty control freak, that makes Kylo Ren a true villain. And what this movie is saying is that Rey exists specifically to undermine that. Rey is the expression of the Force's will to say that ethos is wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I actually Watched all Movies after i've seen The Last Jedi last week and now i'm a 100% Sure that The Last Jedi is one of the worst Star Wars Movies i have ever seen. I loved the OT and i even liked Episode 3. To be honest i like Revenge of the Sith more then Episode 8 and if Rian Johnson ever makes another Star Wars Movie, i wouldn't watch it. Disney and Rian Johnson killed Star Wars and this Movie felt like the End of the Saga. I hope JJ can save Episode IX, before Rian Johnson screws up Star Wars forever with his own Trilogy, that noboby wants to see anymore.<br/><br/>I hate you Rian Johnson! I hope you read this and feel bad for what you did to Millions of Star Wars Fans!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It shows that nobody in Disney, nor on same Lucasfilm has any idea of what Star Wars is. Not even Kathleen Kennedy, who is supposed to be the custodian of Star Wars lore and story cohesion and after working with Lucas for many years, you would think something of SW lore and sense would stick with her, well , it seems she's just a business woman who's only in for the money and doesn't care on the quality of the product....or she couldn't say no to Disney whims , which make her a coward business woman.<br/>Anyway, is understandable that after the mess that The Force Awakens was , story wise, it would have been hard to fix that mess in the Last Jedi, or at least explain further some of the things portrayed in TFA, such as, who are the Knights of Ren?, Who the hell is Snoke, from where did he come from, how this apparently powerful being was out of the radar from the Sith of the galaxy (Palpatine and Vader)?. Why Rey is so powerful and knows how to master Jedi techniques where she had zero training before?. and a large etc etc etc.<br/><br/>Well guess what, nothing of this is explained in TLJ and is actually discarded at all by Rian Johnson's horrible excuse of a script. He decided just to kill Snoke without providing background story, he decided that Rey is a nobody with nobody parents who sold her for booze. So she's just powerful, just because, you know, girl power and 21st century feminism. Knights of Ren was a BS invented by JJ Abrams and Rian seems didn't like that subject so he decided to just ignore them completely in this movie.<br/>And the worst sin of Johnson....he transformed Luke Skywalker into the ultimate coward in the galaxy. Yes, that same Luke Skywalker with many heroic traits from the original trilogy, that Jedi that sensed the good in his twisted and evil father (the second most evil villain in the galaxy, by the way) and went into a suicide mission to bring him back to the light , because he was family, that same Luke, years after in The Last Jedi era he decided to kill his nephew (the only son of his twin sister and his freaking best friend, Han), just because he showed few dark side tendencies....really Disney?.<br/>That made him a coward being and seems he didn't try anymore to bring Kylo back to the light or confront Snoke as the Master Jedi he supposedly was, he just left everybody, friends, family and decided he wanted to die alone in some forgotten island in a distant world. And for what reason Luke left a map so his friends could find him "in a time of need" in the first place, if the real reason for him was to escape to die alone and didn't want to be bothered?. It doesn't make sense at all.<br/><br/>The way Rian Johnson's disrespected Luke's character like that is unforgivable. It throws to the garbage can the Hero's journey that George Lucas built for this character. Also, what was the point of Rose and Finn?, was just a distractor and made no purpose at all for the overall story. Why the admiral Holdo couldn't just tell Poe of her plans so he would't have call for mutiny in the first place? Is very idiotic of her part.<br/><br/>And Leia Mary Poppins was ridiculous. Yes, she might have the force (she is the daugther of the Chosen one, Anakin Skywalker after all) and surely she also is strong in the Force, and might even have received training or some lessons from his brother Luke, but nothing of this is explained in the movie. Is just a Christmas miracle that she survived in the vaccum of space with no suit and  after an explosion blasted a few feet from her, it seems. Is Disney magic , most likely.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is deeply flawed and plain bad, Rian Johnson should just stick to direct and never touch a pen again to write ANYTHING.<br/>I don't have any interest of the 3 pieces of garbage he will supposedly create in the new trilogy Disney assigned to him. He dropped the ball severely in the Last Jedi. Movie is not worth the money or your time. You will waste 2 and half hours of your life in this.<br/><br/>It seems that the real Star Wars story finished in Episode VI, Return of the Jedi. This Disney Star Wars is not Star Wars, is something else. Is not even good sci-fi.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

El problema es que la película es irreal, para nada creíble. Y no me refiero a que haya naves espaciales, alienígenas y poderes "mágicos", de esa base partimos como algo normal y creíble en la ciencia fición. El problema es que los personajes toman decisiones estúpidas de forma repetida, ocurren cosas inexplicables continuamente, y se contradice en muchas ocasiones con lo que se había establecido como cierto en las películas anteriores.<br/>Como película sci-fi estándar "esta bién" y "es entretenida" (tampoco nada del otro mundo), pero como película de Star Wars es una AFRENTA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Yes, there are elements of the movie that at first seem out of place for a Star Wars film. The Force is used in new ways. You can even say the Force and its many forms (and its divisiveness) are the star of the film. There are many plot-points and none have the ending the audience is prepared for. The film movies quickly, yet it is the longest in the franchise. Most noticeably, Luke Skywalker's story "does not go the way you think." At first, all of these unprecedented changes come as a shock. That may be unsettling for Star Wars fans that feel the franchise must fit in a box. For everyone else, this movie is everything Star Wars should be: funny, unpredictable, filled with family drama, mystic, and inspiring. This movie will be debated as long as Star Wars is a main staple in popular culture. But it should be watched, reflected on, and remembered for bringing new life into one of the longest lasting sagas in cinema's history.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm by no means a fanboy, and I can honestly say this is an objectively BAD film on so many levels. I won't go into the details, as they've been hashed over in so many other user reviews, but the writing and storytelling is shockingly lazy and shoddily done. It's inexplicable to me that this film is so highly rated by the so called "critics". Campy humor with no balance, non-sensical and thin character development, gaping plot holes that appear constantly throughout the film, sub-plots that are totally irrelevant to the story, a central plot that is mind-numbingly stupid (they're running out of gas in space), and a lot of excruciatingly bad dialogue make for an overall terrible 2 1/2 hour movie going experience. I'd seriously rather watch any of the prequels than re-watch this film. For real.  Rian Johnson should be embarrassed, and so should all the professional shills who are promoting this $200 million dumpster fire.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Watched the film twice. The first time I was overwhelmed by what I saw so I knew I needed to see it again. After I watched it for a second time I started to have real issues with it besides Luke's character arc. Major plot points set up in TFA are never answered or just brushed to the side... The logic of Star Wars was completely changed... Somehow force ghosts can affect the world, and you no longer need training to use the force in advanced ways... Hell, even LEIA CAN SOMEHOW FLY THROUGH SPACE...  HOW?? Also the writing in this film is poor... Finn's storyline could've been cut out with Rey doing actual training. Instead we got forced political themes like animal cruelty and capitalism.. Which is completely funny because it's DISNEY... The company that is turning into a monopoly... Anyways, the movie was visually stunning and felt like Star Wars, but the fact that the characters haven't progressed at all in this second film makes me less excited for the finale of the trilogy. Also... Luke milking **** WHY!!!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

On my initial viewing I felt conflicted and unsure of what I had just seen, and couldn't decide whether I enjoyed the movie or not. I believe this came down to expectations on what I thought I would be gaining from Episode VII and what the film actually delivered. Upon my second viewing however, I left the cinema feeling satisfied and excited with the new unexpected direction. for a 2 and half hour movie it certainly flies by and rarely loses its pacing, the plot isn't without its flaws though but it is greater than the sum of its parts, it delivers some amazing visuals with one scene being especially jaw dropping. the acting is also top notch, with strong performances particularly from Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and Andy Serkis. it is a very well constructed film and a fine addition to the Star Wars Universe 8.5/10<br/><br/>Edit: I want to address the 0 scores people are giving, i don't care how old you are, whether you are 10 years old or 50 years old. Show some goddamn maturity!! i understand if you didn't enjoy the plot, that is fine, no movie will please everyone. but try and at least acknowledge the skill that has gone into the special effects, or the music, or the acting, or even the set design and costume design. You cannot sit there and tell me all of those things plus more are representative of a ZERO score, go ahead and subtract points for a story you hated i don't care, but show some objectivity and give it at least a 5 for all those aspects I've stated as they were executed with so much skill and expertise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's reckless subversion for the sake of subversion.It's deconstruction with no meaning or purpose.It's a cynically assembled soapbox, made by people so arrogant and unappreciative that they would stand atop the legacy of one of film's most quintessential tales just to make an uninsightful, short-sighted point about "leaving the past behind" and toss in some hamfisted political notes at the captive audience.It's worse than any corporate cash-in or any moronic prequels. The Last Jedi is an articulate attack on Star Wars itself and everything it represents.These people had no idea what they were dealing with, The Last Jedi is cinematic manslaughter.<br/>If you enjoyed The Last Jedi, you do not care about Star Wars.You don't care about the transcending, timeless power of stories and myths and archetypes. You're just a dog who drools when the bell rings.Star Wars OT and Luke Skywalker can't be tarnished by anyone, but The Last Jedi tried.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I say this not because I was upset with any huge twist in the plot (there isn't one). I say this because the film basically crammed in too many side plots and unnecessary sequences so that the actual story arcs are too shallow and predictable. There is little suspense. I never felt like the characters were in any real danger. And when one character that I did care for seemed to be gone forever, it was brought back within a few minutes. The only mildly interesting scenes were the ones with Luke Skywalker. The film does answer our questions about what happened between Luke and Kylo Ren. But the film doesn't really provide any deeper insight into our characters. Who is Snoke? Where did he come from? Why is he Supreme Ruler? How did he begin to seduce Ben Solo to the dark side? How in the heck does the New Order have so much resources after the Empire was defeated? Why does the New Order want to bring the end to the Republic? Why is the Republic so weak even after destroying the Star Killer or whatever it's called? Why is Rey so invested in the Force and her destiny? Why does Kylo Ren want to be the next Vader?<br/><br/>None of these questions are answered, and they probably never will. Instead we are just taken on a roller coaster of side sequences around the Luke-Rey-Kylo plot that are repetitive and do not invest our emotions. Most of these sequences are just dumb and without consequence. They are just meant to carry the film because the actual parts you care about are maybe 20 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>This was a wasted opportunity. Let there be no mistake. This is not our generation's Empire Strikes Back. Not even close. This is a Marvel superhero movie dressed up as a Star Wars flick. Tons of dumb headache-inducing sequences with a thin plot and new characters without any depth. This film will not stand the test of time by any measure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I am literally obsessing on how mixed I feel toward this movie. I can't concentrate. So here's my pros and cons list. I will probably update. (again, just to keep my head clear)<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Gorgeous cinematography<br/>-Fantastic action sequences<br/>-Interesting dynamic between Kylo and Rey<br/>-Interesting and much needed "end" to the traditional jedi way<br/>-Great acting by Mark, Carrie, and most of the other cast members<br/>-Incredible scene in Snoke's throne room (yes, all of it)<br/>-Kylo is a fascinating villain<br/>-Interesting focus on the "grey" areas between the black and white<br/>-Force ghost Yoda<br/>-Mostly funny humor<br/>-Overall very fun and interesting to watch<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Continuity from previous episodes is neglected<br/>-Slightly off-putting meta-narrative about "forgetting the past"<br/>-Luke's character arc is questionable at best<br/>-Snoke is a throwaway villain with no backstory after being built up in Ep. VII<br/>-Captain Phasma is another throwaway villain with a stupid death<br/>-A couple plot-holes (Ex: Luke goes into exile, but they found a map?)<br/>-Many moments that are just strange or written poorly<br/>-Finn and Rose subplot is literally pointless, romance is forced and cringe-worthy<br/>-Finn gets no character development<br/>-The casino subplot could have been avoided if Holdo hadn't been a b**ch to Poe<br/>-Poe came off as an idiot<br/>-Excessive CGI, especially in the casino<br/>-Luke's final battle with Kylo was neat, but overall disappointing<br/><br/>In conclusion, I can safely say that this movie is divisive for fans. While most tend to choose one extreme, I myself am torn. I had fun watching the movie, and am generally interested in the story. That said, I can't ignore the problems like some fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I saw the first movie at age 4 , so yup – you can still be lifelong fan and love this movie. I don’t need anyone telling me otherwise thanks.<br/><br/>PLOT - easy to follow, it ain't rocket science. If you can't get your head around it, or don't even know it's there then that's your problem, not the movie. "Story" is different to "plot", and there is a great SW story here, that follows the tradition of conflict, hope and redemption.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS - On one hand people are complaining about Luke, and how he isn't the Luke of old, and then in the same breath they complain about lack of character development?!? Well , which is it? Character development please, but oh, wait, just not for Luke ?!?<br/>Luke’s arc is great. He is not a coward in this movie. Changed yes, but not a coward. New characters are introduced without suffocating the main story, and will likely develop into the next movie, and yes, they do affect the plot and add to the themes. Seems a few too many “fans” aren’t comfortable with strong female characters or a character getting hauled up for mansplaining. Again, that’s a problem with the viewer, not the movie.<br/><br/>ROMANCE – Apparently there was a budding romance between Finn and Rey in TFA. Seems two characters of the opposite sex can’t exist in the same movie and just be close without have to fall in love. LEIA – agree, her “force” scene didn’t seem to fit. I’ll concede that.<br/><br/>There is great, inspiring, film making here; and look for the little details and nuances, many that you will miss first time (I have now seen it twice) , but you do appreciate so much more second time round, but i'll keep this spoiler free.<br/><br/>So many perceived problems appear to be from angry people who can’t concentrate for 150 minutes, or went in looking for something they already filmed in their head. While looking for their own movie, they ended up missing a great one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But for god's sake when the population of US turned into anti-white fashist femininsts? Why a ten year old boy or girl needs to see stupidly bad white males as villians and brown/black people, dumb women and ultra powerful droids must be accepted as heros? All the characters are either idiots or cowards. In the old movies all masters light or dark earned their places in hardship, and they fought epic duels in front of our eyes. In these new movies both old masters and heros are shown as cowards and losers also they do not stand a chance on the camera. This time Luke did not even actually fight against any one. In the old movies both villians and heroes had pure causes while on the new movies noone has a real cause to struggle, this effects the value of the movies. The Last Jedi will not end the SW Saga, it just renders the importance of SW Saga as if all the doings of both the Siths and the Jedis, the Imperials and the Rebels were invain, pointless, meaningless. As if that little boy called Anakin never ever lived. All the fun was the small group of people working shoulder to shoulder to stop an evil presence. Both humor and stress was about that little group in all the scenes. Han, Leia, Luke, Chew, 3Po, Artoo in the older trilogy. Qui Gon, Kenobi, Anakin, even Jarjar, 3po, Artoo, Padme in the newer trilogy. They briefly tried Rey, Finn, bb8, Poe but it was destroyed in this movie, Poe just pilots, Finn and bb8 does stupid things with that girl, Rey flirts with Kylo. This is the main reason I guess, not Luke's ending or other plotholes, but the absence of a "close group" having a "journey" while fighting, running whatever, makes this movie not feel like a SW movie :( I understand they want to sell toys and as the resistance finished in this movie we will see all new toys in the next movie but without a soul and without any good plots to actually have fun while watching it, it is obvious that the frenchaise gonna perish in front of our eyes.  For the technical part:<br/>1- If hyper jumps work against enemy vessels why the hell nobody used it back in the old six movies?<br/>2- Why you killed Ackbar instantly, he should have been the last captain sacrificing himself to cover the abandoning crew?<br/>3- If Yoda was able the strike lightenings as a force ghost why the hell no jedi force ghosts ever helping to defeat the dark side?<br/>4- How the hell Rey can be so good in being a jedi on her own?<br/>5- How Rey would claim herself a jedi by her own?<br/>6- Ok Snoke is dead but if he was who he claimed to be, with all that visdom and power how the hell he fell to that stupidly easy move?<br/>7- Why Luke told Kylo that there will be more jedis when he was so sure that jedi order was wrong and had to be destroyed?<br/>8- What is the point of resisting against this stupid First Order morons? 9- Why we watched Finn and that idiot resistance girl go all that long to bypass the tracker when the remnants of the fleet should already jumped while secretly sending the forces to the planet?<br/>10- How with all those resources the Fist Order can't bring the "totalitarian peace" upon the galaxy?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The characters are all very two-dimensional, with the exception of characters who were already developed in previous movies.  As an example, animals are given intelligence and personalities, convincing Chewbacca not to eat meat.  The comic relief is very poor.<br/><br/>Several scenes, such as Luke tossing a lightsaber behind himself, or Snoke's red guards standing at ready, look like they were forced into one take regardless of the fumbling.<br/><br/>The choice of actors is very poor.  Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker acted well, the rest may as well have been fumbling over lines.  Much of the awkwardness can easily be attributed to unfamiliarity with the part rather than being a part of the actual character.   The sum of the characters actions appears to be nothing, as the movie ends with nothing accomplished and only a handful of rebels left.<br/><br/>The most glaring flaw of all, to me, is this sudden realization that you can accelerate a ship to lightspeed through another ship.  If that is possible in this universe, then it would have already been done for so many other purposes.   Lightspeed weapons would easily crack planets.  Lightspeed weapons would have nearly unlimited range to take out ships.  As even small craft can achieve lightspeed, the idea that this is possible completely turns the entire star wars universe on its own head.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is not that hard to make a good Star Wars film, yet somehow the creative team behind this movie seemed to have trouble. Luke didn't feel like Luke at ALL, we still don't know who Snoke is and now he is dead, Rey received zero training of any kind yet is still excellent with a lightsaber and the most powerful jedi (clearly done because Rey is a female), Kylo Ren is a weak baby, Leia flying in space..??, and an anticlimactic death for Luke Skywalker who really should have been showcased as the most powerful Jedi because he EARNED that position - Rey didn't.

Episode VIII ist mindestens so übel die die Prequels. CGI-Snork: lächerlich. Rote Klapperpowerrangerninjas mit Elektropeitschen: unterster B-Movie-Style. Dialoge: atemberaubend dümmlich bis kitschig (der Schluss sieht aus wie ein Weihnachts-Heal-The-World-Musikvideo und vergleicht einen Besen mit einem Lichtschwert- "klasse" Anspielung auf das arme Star Wars Kid) und gespickt mit Zitaten der Episoden IV bis VI, als hätte während des Drehs jemand in regelmäßigen Abständen in einen Hut mit Zettelchen gegriffen, auf denen die OT-Sprüchlein standen, die es dann wie beim Impro-Theater galt sofort irgendwie einzubinden in den blutleeren Klamauk. Chewbacca (frisst ein Hähnchen und grummelt eines dieser Glotzviecher an), C-3PO (soll nicht 'so ein besorgtes Gesicht machen' -hahaha- und gibt wie immer fatale Wahrscheinlichkeiten zum besten), R2-D2 (piepst und projeziert mal wieder Leia in die Bude)... einfach mal aufs Tapet geworfen ohne Sinn oder irgendeine Emotion. BB2 steuert einen gedoptwirkend, laufsaurierartig rennenden AT-ST, der wie ein VW-Käfer passenderweise die komplette Karosserie verliert, um das Innere zu entblößen. Die Rebellen kämpfen mit dünnblechigen, verdecklosen, auseinanderfallenden Seifenkisten gegen verkrüppelte AT-AT-Verschandelungen. Dennoch hält eine hauchzarte Blechdose dem offenbar nur handwarm temperierten "Todesstern"-Wurstgeschütz-Strahl stand... Die "Handlung" scheint von einer untalentierten Schülergruppe auf sagenhafte ermüdende 2 1/2-Stunden zusammengestümpert zu sein unter Aufbringung aller denkbaren Steckungsmittel wie einer Stampede, Meerestiermilchmöpsen, einer Actiongame-Oma (Maz) oder einer Super-Leia als Zombie-Mary-Poppins.  Dazu noch hier eine Verfolgungsjagd, da ein neu benötigter Schlüsselmeister, hier ein Lehrer, der nicht will... furchtbar. Der Falke massakriert ungehindert eine komplette Tie-Fighter-Rotte im Alleingang, ein einfacher X-Wing schießt einen ganzen Sternenzerstörer Stück für Stück zu Schrott beobachtet vom rothaarigen Vollhonk,der anschließend noch per Scherzanruf (!) veralbert wird, der neuerdings schlafende Neffen mördende, weinerliche, griesgrämige, Superfeigling Luke versteht sich auf nicht detektierbare Holografie und Rey und die hässliche Emofratze haben eine Telephatie-Skypenummer am Laufen. Im Weltall gibt's nun Schwerkraft für amtlich analoge Kugelbombenteppiche und der Hyperraumsprung als nichtbezwingbare Kamikazewaffe zum Zerstören beliebiger Raumschiffe wird just neu erfunden. Da ist keiner bisher drauf gekommen mal eben ein paar alte Schiffe auf die Gegner zu fliegen mit Autopilot und voll Stoff, soso. Männer sind durchweg Idionten, lilahaarige und hexennasige Scheusale sind weiblich und schlau. AUsnahme Rey: Mary Sue in Reinstform. Ein Farbiger, eine Asiatin, ein unrasierter Europäer, ein stotternder (!) Lando-Verräter, jede Menge unnütze Handlungsstränge und Nebenschauplätze, degenerierte Waffenhändler auf dem Casinoplaneten, amerikanische Namen, Bügeleisen in Startreklogo-Form, Snoke, Luke, Chromeimertrooperfrau: alle tot. Yoda wieder mal da, Imperium ist ein dumme Kaspertruppe und das ständige Hinterhergereise erinnert an Kampfstern Galaktika.Rogue One war mies, schlecht gestaltet und öde, Episode VII ging als dreist-satirische Zitate-Schleuder durch, aber Episode VIII hat sicher nur einen echten Gewinner hervorgebracht: George Lucas, der jetzt gewiss sein sein, dass es eben doch schlimmer kommen kann als bei seinen Prequels.<br/><br/>EInzig das Star Wars Holiday Special ist natürlich noch ein wenig mieser. (Warnhinweis: dieses Machwerk ist aus gutem Grund von George Lucas wieder eingesammelt worden...)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This was awful beyond words. In the spirit of not revealing spoilers, all I'll say is this: it was a complete departure from The Force Awakens, and the overall tone and feel of Star Wars in general. It was a reboot ... one movie after we got a reboot.<br/><br/>You like Poe? He's wasted, and basically treated like an idiot the whole film. Like Finn? He's wasted too. Liked the budding potential romance between Finn and Rey? Nope, it's gone. Excited to find out about the First Order? Don't get your hopes up. Like Kylo Ren's cool mask? They got rid of that, too. Like Chewie? He's almost omitted from the film. It goes on and on.<br/><br/>This is a movie designed as a middle finger to long time Star Wars fans, and even fans of The Force Awakens. This is a tear-down. This burns the entire lore to the ground and starts fresh, and it's as baffling as it is insulting.<br/><br/>I fear that Marvel is next. Infinity Gauntlet will likely be the last non-political, non-social commentary Marvel film, and from here on out we're getting the absolute worst social justice garbage saturating every aspect of those films, too. 'Han Solo' will be the first Star Wars movies that I won't see in theaters. Which is something that actually breaks my heart.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Plotlines and character arcs established in the previous movie are abandoned or simply dismissed. Certain mysteries established in Force Awakens will be left permanently unsolved, while others have an anticlimactic resolution that would've been better left untouched. Excessive use of humor during serious moments fall flat and eliminate the drama of what could otherwise have been powerful scenes. Every new character doesn't contribute to the plot AT ALL, and just seem to be there to be there. Multiple plot holes are glaringly obvious, and causes a major subplot to be completely unnecessary and only seems to be an excuse to give new characters screen time. Overall, this movie feels rushed, and only released to sell toys for the holidays, and add new maps and characters to Battlefront 2. Best to wait until this movie is on Netflix, but even then, I wouldn't recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I don't like it, but can understand why Disney think it would be a good idea. It's all about money in the end and they don't really care about us older Star Wars fans.  I just don't get why they had to ruin all the SW lore of the previous movies, and why be so disrespectful about it? In many ways this movie is much worse than The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. They were at least made by the creator of the SW universe and even if it was targeted towards children, it was still felt like it took place in the same world.  If you take away Jar Jar, some cheesy CGI and a few questionable ideas (Jango Fett clones), it's at least "Star Wars movies", even if I and many other Star Wars fans didn't like them.<br/><br/>I thought The Force Awakens was ok. Yes, it was basically a scene-by-scene remake of Episode 4, but it brought Star Wars back in a respectful way. I also enjoyed the great visual story telling by Abrahams and Mindel.<br/>I really loved Rogue One. Sure, nostalgia had a lot to do with, but it was also respectful to the universe.<br/><br/>On a personal level I thought the slapstick comedy was awful, not to mention the casino scenes... The Empire acts like they are led by "Dark Helmet" in Spaceballs. Finn was a great character in TFA, but here they just throw all his character advancement away.<br/>I feel really sorry for Boyega, Fisher and Hamill. Their characters are totally ruined in TLJ.<br/><br/>To me, this movie is a parody of SW. It would be more appropriate to call it Spaceballs 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The only time I felt something was 90% into the film. I won't say what precipitated it as to avoid spoilers. JJ may have parroted the original trilogy to a fault, but it worked. This one skirted around the edgers--but missed the mark. Further, it was, at least, 20 minutes too long.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7933853"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Star Wars: The Last Jedi, directed by Rian Johnson, will, as Luke tells Rey, "not go the way you think". The Last Jedi begins straight after the end of the Force Awakens and it is immediately apparent that Rian's vision for the new Star Wars is being put on the big screen. This is the most ambitious film in the franchise to date, as it settles all the fan-theories that have strangled every Star Wars fan for the past two years, by simply scrapping them, and I seriously liked it. First and foremost, all the characters, bar Han Solo, return in this epic, action-packed and emotional film, including Rey, Finn, Poe, General Leia, and Kylo Ren. After appearing briefly at the end of the Force Awakens, we finally see Luke as the old, rugged and isolated Jedi, who simply does not want to go back to what it used to be, saying that "it is time for the Jedi to end". We are also introduced to a trio of new characters: Rose, a maintenance worker in the resistance; Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, a leading officer in the resistance; and DJ, a codebreaker and a thief. Each character, both old and new, have a shining moment, few, in particular, were visually stunning to watch, such as Kylo Ren slicing Snoke in half with Luke's lightsaber and Holdo sacrificing her own life for the escaping resistance ships by flying the command ship straight at the First Order fleet at lightspeed, silencing the film so the audience could stare in awe. The acting was the best that's ever been in a Star Wars movie, with Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and the late Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa the highlights in that department. The action was spectacular, particularly as the Rey and Kylo team-up against Snoke and the rebels escaping the First Order fleet was panning out at the same time. The story arc of Rey, Kylo, and Luke was incredibly well done, with Rey planting herself as a powerful force user and Kylo apprehensive on his allegiance to the light and dark sides. The reveal of Rey's parentage I believe was very well done and came as no surprise to myself, but I'm am certain that many who were expecting something more grandiose will be dissatisfied. Admittedly, however, many Star Wars fans will find these revelations and events irritating and conflicting. One such being of Supreme Leader Snoke, who was simply a red-herring this whole time, and though his death was shocking, it was somewhat unwarranted that the Force Awakens painted him as the ultimate villain, similar to Emperor Palpatine, for then to be killed off. Despite this, the whole sequence of events spanning a short period time that led up to this moment was suspenseful and thrilling to watch, and the immediate team-up of Rey and Kylo, as well as the kamikaze of Holdo into the fleet, culminated in without a doubt, one of the greatest Star Wars moments. My other issues, some are nitpicky, include Captain Phasma, who was a wasted opportunity again, and will be known as the Boba Fett of the current trilogy; the Finn, Rose story arc was weak and the ensuing romance felt forced; how did Finn, Rose and Poe know to call Maz Kanata to find the codebreaker when only Finn had met her for barely a brief moment in the Force Awakens; and how did DJ know about the escaping rebel ships when they were captured. I know many found Leia's using the force to fly in space far-fetched (I initially found it weird), but knowing this was Carrie Fisher's last movie as Leia, it was a nice to see her using her force sensitive powers numerous times. My lowest point of the Last Jedi was Canto Bight. What was the point really? The entire plot to find the code-breaker was utterly pointless and eventuated in a total failure. It introduced nothing that was relevant to the rest of the main plot and in the end, they found a less qualified thief in Benicio del Toro's DJ. Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, despite its weaknesses in some aspects, is one of the best in the franchise, equal second with a New Hope behind Empire Strikes Back, and where many of the negativity comes from maybe because it is the least like any Star Wars movie previously. Many of the complaints are fair, but the surprises that we were least expecting made this a far more thoughtful film and its ambitious take on the universe of Star Wars is a refreshing new step.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie made risky decisions... and they all paid off.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson has directed and written some absolutely great works - including Brick and Looper, which are two films that have brilliant writing. I will admit that I was taken aback by the amount of humour in this movie, but that got me thinking, this Star Wars film has the most emotion of any film in the franchise. Everyone complained that The Force Awakens was a remake of A New Hope, but now everyone is complaining that this is not a remake of Empire Strikes Back. If anything, it's better. Why? Because for the first time it feels that a Star Wars film has dedicated time to actually fleshing out its characters, and the writing plays a huge part in that.<br/><br/>Unlike previous films, there's no dodgy writing or cringe-inducing lines (there is potentially one, but in context it's a perfectly acceptable line), and we actually get to know the characters more - be it ones that have been introduced in this trilogy, or some of the original characters. Understandably Mark Hamill was disappointed by his new characterisation but I honestly believe that this was a fantastic performance; one which has notably annoyed the fanbase, to which I ask you, seriously? Luke Skywalker is no longer the young idealistic adventurer he was in the original films, he's a much darker character weathered by the sense of failure, bearing the burden of having to live up to weighted expectations (similar to the expectations of fans for this trilogy coincidentally...). As for the other characters, Kylo Ren might be the best written character in the franchise - he's a complex character who is conflicted, at once vicious and powerful but also showing a sensitivity and reluctance to his atrocities. The newly introduced characters, such as Rose and DJ, are also humanised, far more than any of the characters in the prequels.<br/><br/>Story wise, this film has been criticised by the fans (again), which I must disagree with (again). As I had stated this was by far the most emotional Star Wars film I have seen. Although there were no single moments that matched the sadness of Han Solo's death in the preceding film, this was a film that had moments where I would laugh, cry and moments that left me in suspense. The story is quite straightforward in that it's actually quite minimal - the Rebels have to escape the First Order, Finn and Rose try to find a hacker to assist them, whilst Rey attempts to encourage Luke to train her and help his sister, all while Kylo Ren continues to struggle with his nature. This is a film that has plenty of plot, but is focused more on the emotional aspect. The effects are the real stars of this franchise though, and boy do they deliver. The action set pieces are exquisite, with the climactic battle being a visual treat.<br/><br/>So what can I say? I enjoyed this movie, but I am aware that there is a fanbase out there that believes Disney has ruined the franchise to which I say ABSOLUTELY NOT! This is, in my honest opinion, the third best Star Wars movie - bested only by the first two, primarily because I have had years to reflect on those and only days to reflect on this one. You might think that my judgement is less informed, but I disagree. This was a film that made me think about it after I left the cinema, and it moved me as a good film often does. To those who despise this film, I advise you to engage with it properly, maybe then you will realise the brilliance of it and the genius of Rian Johnson for daring to take a risk. It might not be what you expected, but that doesn't mean it's bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They built on so many things just for them to get **** on later without explaining anything. If Finn didnt exist nothing would change. 4) No character development. Nobody cared about the chinese girl and her romantic affiliation. Nobody. Poe also got shat upon. And no Poe doesnt care that much about Finn. That makes no sense. 5) The whole luke arc. Destroyed his char once and for all. I mean literally, I dont wanna spoil it but it makes no effing sense<br/><br/>But the worst thing that infuriates me is the people who blindly accept everything disney shoves down their throats and try to support and make sense of every weak plot point, every plot hole or bad decision they made. Just because some totally "unbiased" critics claimed the movie is a masterpiece they dare jump on the love wagon claiming its the best star wars movie of all time???? Even better than ESB?? Thats humiliating pathetic and honestly disappoints me. It shows ppl are so easily influenced and have zero critical thinking or ability to judge something for themselves. This movie made it hard for me to enjoy rewatching the franchise i so much love and with which I grep up with...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Storylines that went nowhere, underdeveloped characters, horrible misplaced jokes, and just a whole lot of nonsensical garbage.  Leia floating like some frozen Mary Poppins space angle, Snoke (whoever he was) getting sliced in half (hey look your shoes untied!). Rey going down a hole, maybe to the Darkside, but no just repeating finger snaps, a plan foiled because Finn parked on the beach, some stuttering character who was central to the plot then not, Luke milking some space sea cow,  a terrible light saber scene with Ren, Rey and imperial guards, on and on and on it was awful.  Anyone who found this movie even remotely viewable could not have had anything invested into it.  And then there is the way they wrote out Luke.  There aren't enough words to say how disappointing it was to see Luke Skywalker after 30 some years, the ultimate hero of a generation of kids, written out so poorly.  This movie was criminally bad.  The only reason I gave it a one (1) was because it was Carrie Fisher's last movie.  Otherwise it would be zero (0).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Old rules are broken, mysteries remain unexplained and become even more puzzling while the new additions are confusing, arbitrary and short-sighted.<br/>- Absolute hatred for the original story. Old characters are turned upside down. Killed outright for no reason, made dumb and impotent for no reason. Or made divine when they weren't. Why is Ackbar an irrelevant character in the background next to a Vice-Admiral? And killed without even having a close-up shot?<br/>- Insulting and condescending demagogy made to obfuscate the aforementioned. Yoda says the Force is... whatever. It doesn't matter. Luke is here to show that - whatever. The original saga and the prequels were crap. Said by the most beloved and most crucial character of the entire saga.<br/>- The lowest form of sucking up to the boss of the production: Kathleen Kennedy. A super-officer aristocrat lady is there to serve as Kennedy's ego trip, and a First Order officer is even called Kennedy. Since when do Star Wars characters have Earth names? Since now. Because "sucking up to the boss" day.<br/>- Complete disregard for the norms of writing Star Wars. Star Wars characters do not mention the concept of "soul", nor do they say "Godspeed". This changes things. It changes the philosophy of it.<br/>- The humor is criminally bad. Star Wars epic isn't an episode of "College Humor".<br/>- There's a persistent string of completely ridiculous decisions and behavior on all sides. This is like watching the "Incompetent wars". It's even worse than "Battlestar Gallactica" that started its trend.<br/>- NONE of the mysteries of the story are answered. They're not even cleared up a bit. There's a point at witch teasing becomes mocking. This is it.<br/><br/><br/>As for acting.... this is more of a director's mistake than that of actors themselves.<br/>But really - it's just as bad as TFA. Even worse, at times.<br/>Hell - the First Order officers at least looked like military officers in TFA. Now they're caricatures of some weird misbegotten creatures in uniforms.<br/><br/>I expected disaster from the start.<br/>This is even worse than I expected.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

You must change "The Last Jedi" to "The Last Star Wars". Ok, let's go for HUGE SPOILERS. Star Wars is not just a little cute movie and special effects. It's a great drama in a beautiful environment with spatial effects. Do you want to tell another story, from another perspective? Great! But be consistent and cohesive with the seven previous films. Turning Luke into a coward was a filthy; Yoda in a clown, was a filthy; In fact, everyone is a comedian in this movie. LEIA FLYING IN SPACE. Come oooonn!!!!!!! Hux became a ridiculous one (where is that tense dispute with Kylo??); Snoke became a nobody, just like the Rey's parents; Finn, before he was a born rebel, was transformed into a dazzled by the casino; Maz Kanata in a fight for the union's command? What? She ran a bar a thousand years ago; The script is nonsense and poorly written. And I do not want to talk anymore because this movie is not worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Let's be fair, it has to happen at some point for the new stories to begin. The problem is the movie has many flaws. The main story really is not well built especially at the end. You want Luke to pass on the Jedi spirit to Rey? OK! Fine. They need to be the main characters that click at the end. But obviously this is not the case. Luke swings his sword for 30 seconds and Rey lifts rocks for 10 seconds and that's it. It is nice to have supporting characters but they can't mess up the major story line. Also, the story line of Fin and Rose doesn't really make much sense and it is totally unnecessary, especially for the part where they went to look for the code guy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Anyways.<br/><br/>Among the military commanders waiting to lose 90% of the troops until the great idea comes (suicide teleport? better watch the ram into Scimitar from Star Trek:Nemesis), cute animals inserted into pointless space chase, and politically correct division (one girl, one African-American, one Asian, all-female ship commanders yelling "yo pitiful male" to the only military (Poe) able to do or at least try something, and two mandatory white evil guys - too bad the older characters are already whites, so nothing to do about this...), what else remains? (Sorry, I forgot about the casino gratuitous scene and the space cow milk - wat?).<br/><br/>If the future is based on a former storm trooper (wonderful idea to cast John Boyega into a Waffen-SS of the future role, perfect fit, that is) that looks high-school confused all the time, a mechanic turned navigateur and second-hero-in-command, grumpy old Jedi's and stupid villains, then no thanks. I'd rather watch Cylons battling real military humans in Battlestar: Galactica - at least there is sense, seriousness and logic (at least sometimes).<br/><br/>Is not even abysmal. It's Disney making a movie for kids and/or mentally challenged, not sure if is a some sort of Madagascar 3 in space or so. And the future of the francise is bleak.

It is an insult to everything the originals were, everything that made those movies great. Instead what we get is a vanity piece from an egotistical director with oppositional defiance disorder. I had a bad feeling as soon as poe Made a joke about huxes mother that this was not going to go the way any true star wars, or quality movie lover for that matter, desired.    When i walked out of the theater i felt like my childhood was raped, far worse than any of the prequel movies, because it lacked any kind of reverence for what came before it, the legacy of star wars. In fact rian johnsons actions seem malicious and i find myself wishing the worst kinds of things to happen to this talentless  buffoon. His script seemed malicious. We waited this long, only for him to completely destroy one of the greatest charcters in cinematic history , Luke Skywalker, with a nonchalance and hubris that i find deeply insulting. And say what you want about jj abbrahms but at least he was a lover of star wars and respected the foundations george lucas had built. When luke just tosses his fathers lightsaber over his shoulder, this director is trolling an audience just for the sake of shock value. All this movie attempts is shock, with one middle finger after another to the franchises fanbase. But it isnt just the constant disrespect that makes this movie one of the worst of all times , in any genre. Its just piss poor directing and writing, plain and simple. The editing is a mess, and the plot is asinine. Rian introduces things into the star wars universe that make no sense, those giant slow moving bombers, lightspeeding kamikaz cruisers? rebel fleet is running out of gas, who the f is hodo and why do we care? Why do we care about any of these new characters, there was absolutely no develpment. But we did care about learning more about snoke. No sorry the director needs to be edgy and shock you, plus he needs to give a finger to abbrhams. Thats more important than making a good movie.  Rey no longer needs any training to become a jedi, lets just wave a stick around a rock.   Thats all the training she needs, because the idiotic disney casino scene is far more important. Lets bring in those heavy handed social political statements into an escapist film. Better yet, lets just do it in probably the most highly anticipated film of all time.disney has now bought up and ruined every major franchise that i once loved from my childhood. Shame on you all.<br/>I felt like crying when i left the theater and im a young adult male, tears of frustration and anger for what rian johnson has done. He should be homeless and in the gutter for this i put a curse upon his whole life and i hope something really bad happens to him for this<br/><br/>The way he handled luke was a travesty, i feel so sorry for poor mark hamil, who was contractually obligated by disney to complete the movie and keep his mouth shut as the millions of hardcore fans walking into a nightmare unsuspectingly.  Luke skywalker, who threw down his saber in front of the emperor willing to accept death instead of kill his own father makes a decision to strike down unarmed sleeping ben on the hunch that he might turn to the darkside? luke was never a grumpy silly coward, sipping alien milk from the teet? and yet that is exactly how rian chooses to portray him in his woeful ignorance. Add in some cheesy matrix style lightsaber dodges, two in a row, and thats all we see of lightsaber weilding luke, a moment all of us were imagining in our minds for over ten years. And disney thinks its fine, to let rian do this, who the hell is this rian hack anyways, he did three episodes of breaking bad??? What a poor choice, to give the film to this talentless usc graduate. I am so deeply dissapointed in what disney has done here i want them to hurt but i know there are many idiots who will still buy the merchandise play the games and love the shallow trashy dvds. One thing i know for sure is the star wars legacy is dead. Rian has seen to thAt by burning any possible way of recovery, unless you just start over with a brand new episode  8. And leia is dead, and rian had the chance to give her the perfect send off let her float away dead in space, but instead she comes back to life in some bizarre mary poppins act and apparently she is powerful enough in the force to float herself back to the cruiser from space.  Its all too much, and some of you might think im overracting but this movie hurt me so badly i had to make a metacritic account just to try and hurt back this director who i hate so much. Its all so sad, tragic, the only ones who won are corporate disneys goons, the rest of us, the true star wars fans and movie lovers, have lost grievously. The galaxy will never be the same, and i wish i could forget i ever saw this movie but i cant. You have been warned avoid this like the plague</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I didn't watch a single trailer, or read a single review prior to watching The Last Jedi, and I do **not** mind social advocacy messages in a film. I only heard vague sentiments that critics loved the film, which undeniably excited me, but holy moly, I could not disagree more with the critics reception. First off, many of the interesting plot threads created in the Force Awakens like who are Rey's parents, what happened to Luke Skywalker, the greatly anticipated return of Luke Skywalker to the resistance, and developing Phasma and Snokes into a menacing antagonist are all fumbled here to my great disappointment. To my shock, the director and writers instead chose to pursue new and much less interesting subplots involving Finn, Rose, and how the crew of  the resistance flag ship handles an 18 hour chase sequence when low on fuel. I would strongly discourage anyone other than dedicated fans of the series to see this in theaters and rent this film. It's simply not worth the price of admission.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Hhuge plot holes throughout. *SPOILER* a one-dimensional space chase - 3 slightly faster ships vs a galaxy controlling empire - seriously I thought better of Rian Johnson (Looper was an okay time travel movie and just shows how lazy he's been with this one). Very poor pacing and shockingly bad humour that just doesn't work, it's not smart and a lot of it's out of character for the tone of scenes it's in. This is a marvel-like money-making machine, where's my refund? This is not a finished or competent movie. EA/Disney destroyed Battlefront and now RJ/Disney have killed Star Wars.

Feel sorry for my brothers that got hyped just to see Luke milking alien **** terrible acting, terrible attempts at humor, Rey yet again being all powerful, Snoke dying like a **** Luke dying like a **** and Leia dancing through space like a spastic, geriatric superwoman. The Star Wars movies ended with Lucas. Of course, the original movies are the real magic, but I must say TFA and TLJ make the prequels look like masterpieces. Will not be patronizing any more of this wank from Disney or any corporate ****s that only care about bowing to the PC agenda and selling merchandise and more disgusting films to kids and clueless ****s that probably find "Keeping up with the Kardashians" engaging and tasteful. The plot of this movie was horrible, the acting was for the most part utter garbage, and the direction they are taking with the new movies forces me to disown these new movies. I don't count these new movies as Star Wars canon. The Extended Universe is canon.

I truly loved Looper and Brick and was ready for "the best SW movie since Empire". Jezz, what a let down. The movie started with Poe's prank and somehow my head went back to good old Spaceballs...<br/>Leia flew back to the Mon Calamari cruiser...a big WTF was blinking in red in front of my eyes<br/>By the Casino scene I was already scratching my head wondering if this was a sequel to Guardians of The Galaxy, not a SW one.<br/>Every single time Holdo or DJ popped in the screen something felt off, like "I'm not watching a Star Wars movie"<br/>And when Luke died for no apparent or at least well deserved (plot-wise) reason I got really angry.<br/><br/>In the end Star Wars is suffering because of the lack of a clear map of how this new trilogy was going to unfold. When Rey, Snoke, Kylo or the Lightsaber were introduced in VII I thought that they had clear in mind their overall arcs and backstories, but as Rian Johnson has admitted there was no plan at all. And man it shows. It's clear that the plot for VIII was not what JJ Abrams would have written, and that Rian didn't like what JJ did in VII. Instead, the new director was obsessed with avoiding the pitfalls of VII (a copycat of episode IV) and thus he tried to surprise viewers...with almost every important decision made gone wrong. And since the trilogy was not mapped at all he could basically do what he wanted to do. TFA very clearly tried to set up new characters, mysteries...and Rian simply doesn't care at all. He is a man on a mission: getting ready a clean slate but doing it in a very surprising way. And in the process he lost track of what a Star Wars story should be and having characters acting out of character, even the new ones.<br/><br/>Is the movie a complete disaster? Should its rating be a zero? No way. It's beautifully shot, Hamill and Driver just kill it, John Williams is back, the FX are top notch and somehow you feel that there is a good movie buried under a pile of bad plot decisions. There are brilliant and thrilling sequences that should rank among the best in the series. But sure, I understand that for most diehard fans (like me) some of the mentioned plot decisions eclipse everything else. Now, the funny thing is thinking how JJ will try to fix the situation in IX...he created something promising, Rian thrashed it, and now he is receiving it back with the aim of closuring it ...somehow. We'll see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

You will just have to see it and decide for yourself. Second, one thing most people agree on is this film is beautiful, I highly recommend seeing this in IMAX 3D. This movie was made for the IMAX 3D and I was blown away. I am of the camp of I loved the original trilogy, I thought the prequels were not that good but ok. Episode 3 was pretty good. I absolutely hated the Force Awakens and I liked Rogue One.<br/><br/>That being said I liked The Last Jedi a lot. It has it's moments of bad lines, humor that falls flat, plot holes, and it even drags in parts but, in the end,the rest of the movie makes up for it. And when I say makes up for it I mean it is great. I went through so many emotions watching this and through most of the movie I was on the edge of my seat. I really like what they did with this movie, there are so many unexpected things and it's refreshing. Go see it and judge for yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The force awakens was good but played it way too safe. This one took risks. It was weird in great ways. It certainly stumbled in spots, but that didn't bother me because it wasn't pandering or patronizing...while the force awakens was. I got my money's worth. Diehards can nitpick about silly things, but they'll never be satisfied. Star wars was never about realism though, it was about fun. It's not Star Trek tightly bound to sci-fi seriousness or even physics. Star wars of our era has to push the envelope. It needs to change and take risks. It needs to surprise us and maybe challenge us or make us mad. I loved rogue one because it had nothing to live up to because all the characters were new, but this had everything to live up to...if they had stuck to some kind of formula it would have been boring. This was not boring. Watch it for yourself... and think about what star wars should be today?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7930086"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">When I left this movie, I felt conflicted. It had taken almost all of my expectations and completely flipped them on their head. I was expecting a much different movie to the one I got. However, after careful consideration, both of the movie itself and for what it does to Star Wars canon, I have decided that I quite like this movie.<br/><br/>I do disagree with a number of choices this movie made, from having Luke be even more of a washed up hermit than I expected him to be, to killing off Snoke at such an early stage. However, I don't think it deserves the level of hate it has gotten. Once I made peace with the decisions the movie made, I was able to see it as what it was, a beautifully made movie that makes hard choices that move the franchise in a bold new direction. And as much as it hurts to let the past die, I'm confident that this new direction can give life to Star Wars for decades to come.<br/><br/>On the other side, I don't think this movie is AS revolutionary as some people are making it out to be. The Jedi order is not being thrown away; it's returning to its roots, to a time before they had become the complacent, Republic-serving, priestly Order they had become. There's a blink-and-you-miss-it moment in the Last Jedi, where you see that the sacred Jedi texts were, in fact, not in that tree when it caught on fire. Rey and secretly taken them with her when she left, as evidenced a by them being shown on the Falcon at the end as Finn is grabbing a blanket. Thus, when Yoda set the tree ablaze, he wasn't burning down the Jedi tradition, because as an omniscient Force ghost, he knew the books weren't there. That means when he said "Those books don't contain anything the girl Rey doesn't already have," he literally meant that she has the books. This means when she is training to become a Jedi, and eventually training a new Jedi Order herself, she'll be building it from the original Jedi teachings.<br/><br/>Really, this movie brings the whole saga full circle, enhancing the prequels by acknowledging how the Jedi failed during that era and making it a central plot point. The Jedi philosophy isn't bad, no, what the Jedi had become over a thousand years of peace and complacency is bad. This film makes the promise that the Jedi Order will be rebuilt to be what is was originally supposed to be. And that makes me excited for the future. (Also the possible future of showing what the old Jedi Order was like when it was still in it's full glory, Rian Johnson trilogy anyone?) But that's just my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

You can tell that Rian Johnson not only respects but appreciates the SW universe. The Last Jedi is close enough and pays enough homage to Empire that it feels comfortable or well known. Except it's not. It deviates in all the best ways becoming something almost entirely new. There are so many great SW stories out there and we're just beginning to scratch the surface of them.

If you're trying to get your head around the ridiculous user score you should bear in mind three things that are contributing to this backlash(against what is one of the best sci-fi films of the decade so far, remember):<br/><br/>1. Certain fans believe they own this franchise, and any deviation from their mind-numbing check-list of 'things a Star Wars film must do' is met by the most pathetic, infantile tantrums outside of an actual kindergarten. They also believed that they had the plot of the film mapped out before release simply by studying the trailers, and when it turned out that they had been wrong-footed and in fact they didn't have a clue(none of us did), they took it as a personal insult. Just digest that fact: grown ups, who pretend they care about cinema, were angry that they weren't able to predict the plot in advance. They felt angry because a film surprised them. That should tell you something about the intellectual and artistic level at which some of these so-called fans operate, and it's not flattering. It's the kind of attitude that, if it were widespread, would kill all art, all entertainment, dead overnight.<br/><br/>2. A lot of people feel justifiably angry towards the way this franchise is being handled by Disney, and The Last Jedi comes hot on the heels of the debacle that was Star Wars Battlefront 2; a hideously cynical, craven exercise in bleeding online gamers dry, and a PR disaster that left Disney and Electronic Arts(the company who published the game) with a whole lot of egg on their faces. As I say, it's perfectly reasonable to be angry towards Disney and their handling of the Star Wars brand. Simultaneously, it's completely irrelevant and has nothing to do with whether the film is good or bad.<br/><br/>3. This third reason for much of the backlash is by far the most depressing, and it comes down to one thoroughly tedious and increasingly ugly little word: politics. The most scathing and unhinged of the criticisms have come from a troll army, whose size is hugely overinflated by the number of sockpuppet accounts involved, and their objection is that this is an 'SJW film', with a 'leftist bias'. They complain about the black character, Finn, they complain about the female lead, they complain when a female beats a man in the film, they complain when a black beats a white; and in case you think this is an exaggeration I was reading some of the comments at The Guardian, a newspaper with relatively reasonable commenters, and the first criticism came from someone complaining about the "anti-slavery message" in the film. That was the first issue with the film that came to his narrow little mind. For the record, the "anti-slavery message" is barely discernible, and melds naturally with the flow of the narrative. Indeed, it's represented by a couple of images that last, in total, about...ninety seconds? But as jaw-droppingly nasty and petty as that complaint is, it still represents the more tolerable end of the spectrum of entitled, alt-right-crackpottery. There is an avalanche of worthless right-wing whining about this film, and astonishingly, most of it makes that Guardian comment seem insightful - after all, it didn't talk about Rose Tico, a very likable new character, being fat and ugly and Asian, or complain about Finn being...ugh, I could go on, but why bother. Everyone knows what the worst of the internet is like - just imagine them coming after one of the best sci-fi films of recent years simply because they don't like a yucky gurl being the lead and you'll have captured the character of much of the criticism this film is receiving.<br/><br/>So, those three reasons have coalesced to form a perfect storm of stupidity and ignorant, dullard banality, typified by someone setting up an actual petition to try and force Disney to stop making good Star Wars films. I can only hope that they ignore these very loud, very busy, utterly irrelevant basement-dwellers, and continue to allow creatives like Rian Johnson the freedom to make Star Wars films as funny, intense, surprising, exciting and exhilarating as The Last Jedi - because make no mistake, this is the real deal. A Star Wars film that's not just good 'for a Star Wars film' but actually stands on its own two feet as a dizzying, fizzing, cinematic joy-ride through everything that makes the Star Wars universe even vaguely interesting. It's a startling light-speed jump forward for a franchise that, after the underwhelming episode VII, seemed to be slowly settling into a comfortable, predictable orbit. Think of it as a little like Game Of Thrones's Red Wedding(only not as bleak, obviously): a reordering, and a signal to the viewer that whatever comes next, you won't be able to predict it just by watching the trailers.<br/><br/>My rating: 9.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Who wrote the map to find Luke Skywalker? Especially since he didn’t want to be found. Why did Luke die the way he did? He just literally disappeared into the sun. Who is this Snoke exactly? And even though he could manipulate Ben Solos mind and even predict his every move, it was almost humorous him bragging about this and then Ben Solos killing him just seconds later. Why didn’t the First Order kill the Resistance’s transport ships all at once? Instead they pick one off at a time. It was so predictable that obviously some would escape. Why couldn’t Holdo simply set a timer for a lightspeed jump and climb into an escape pod instead of sacrificing herself? She could have survived easily. And why didn’t see tell her plans to Poe? Which could have avoided so much mess…… I could list a dozen more plotholes. Plus this whole movie just felt like far left liberal hollywood propaganda bullcr@p rather than Star Wars. If we are going to have a female protagonist then OK, great. But Luke Skywalker was supposed to be the “One” and he couldn’t lift one rock with his mind when he was getting taught by Yoda for WEEKS. Now this female protagonist doesn’t even get three lessons from Luke Skywalker and she can wield a sword better than most and lift hundreds of boulders. This film try's so hard to be all inclusive with too many political points that the scripts reads like an SJW's students essay on a Canadian’s college campus.<br/>1.) Strong overpowered female protagonist who is basically flawless and never makes mistakes? Check! 2.) female leader leading the rebels and can fly through space like superman “check”! 3.), The vice admiral being another female leader who looks like someone who takes gender studies with purple hair "check", 4.) Female stormtrooper who can’t get shot like a normal stormtrooper “check”, 5.) main character good guys being black, Asian, Hispanic “check” or white females "check", 6.) female saving male character and basically being smarter and making correct decisions “check”. 7.) Every evil character being a white male "check", 8.) white guys being made fun of because of his "pasty skin" "check". Chewbacca becoming vegetarian, animal rights abuses, diversity, interracial relationships, weapons profiteering. This is supposed to be a galaxy far far away!  I understand wanting to give us this diversity, especially if the film is so big. But it seems that these over arching plotlines and stories just to make the characters fit. Has left a Star Wars with a watered down story that nobody cares about. At least DO IT Right, at least develop the characters properly!.

They really did **** on Luke as a character and Mark as an actor. Not the exit the most iconic hero deserved. I understand the need to move on from the Skywalkers for the good of the franchise but that was a joke. Also where were the knights of ren that were so nicely teased in the previous film?

What I mean by true fan is I've seen every SW film in the theater (this was and will be the last) and my "man-cave" is decorated in SW. This movie is the Crystal Skull of the franchise. Below is what is wrong with The Last Jedi:<br/><br/>1. Luke’s death is meaningless and he dies a coward. That is not the Luke Skywalker of SW lore.<br/>2. Luke milks a space alien. WTF??<br/>3. Leia “Mary Poppins” Organa<br/>4. Spaceships running out of fuel?? When was fuel ever a problem in the SW galaxy?<br/>5. Way too much Guardians of the Galaxy humor.<br/>6. Snoke who?<br/>7. Rey’s full name; Rey “Mary Sue” Nobody<br/>8. Shirtless Kylo.<br/>9. Who needs Jedi anymore? We have SJW (Space Justice Warriors)<br/>10. By killing off the last remaining “old white men”, all the villains are white guys, all the good guys are minorities. Hooray for diversity!<br/>11. Grrrl power!<br/>12. Casino scene is a political jab at the 2%ers, yet Disney is part of the 2%ers.<br/>13. First trilogy people thought that being a Jedi was inherent to the Skywalker bloodline. Second trilogy, if you had enough midichlorians in your blood you can be trained in the ways of the force. This trilogy, everyone has the potential to use the force. In other words, everyone gets a trophy!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
