Mark Hammill(guy who plays Luke) himself doesn't really like the film. Most of of the movie is suspenseful and has you wondering what was going to happen next. Whenever the suspense died, I was underwhelmed. The fight scenes were not very entertaining and  didn't like a lot of the character development. I think The Force Awakens was better. I hope the finale of the trilogy is way better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7990121"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I think that most people who abhorred it just haven’t catched the big picture. What is most grand about Star Wars is its philosophy: this movie has brought up the Force cosmology, with concepts from Buddhist, Hinduist, Judeochristian and Taoist traditions. I got surprised in such synthetic way that the Force was managed to be presented as a cosmic regulator that balances the natural laws and the antagonisms and consequences of the beings’ free wills, and thus the movie adds more to it and helps to give understanding that it brings harmony by intervening according to each one choices to the dark or light side. Harmony where it is apparently chaos, balance in opposites, recurrence of life, death, freedom, limitations - learning and enlightenment events until sentient beings arise by means of providential opportunities and serve to give other opportunities to new fellow beings. Luke said it all, the Force isn’t just about lightsabers, fights and floating things (and maybe those are the things that some fans gave more importance to and felt for their lack in the movie), it exists by itself and manifests through those who can bring harmony at the moment; Luke wasn’t a coward or deserter, just as he told his mistake was done in a moment of pure instinct, of fear of losing what he created and loved, so he made a choice in an instant, and although he regretted it right after and couldn’t have imagined what would happen, he was trained and taught according to the Jedi lessons to know that one shall not give way to bad emotions and by them commit decisions to destroy others, since this perpetuates the dark side. So why wasn’t he able to control himself? He got grieved about the way he had learned and his power weren’t enough to avoid it, so in torment he exiled himself to order things up with himself, like an internal fight with reformulation of old concepts, he saw he had to find other ways than those he was trying, and die like this if unsuccessful, but he haven’t lost connection to the Force since he advanced a deeper understanding of it and Yoda was accompanying him. That can be a moral lesson to our lives and shows deeply the human potential, that no matter how trained we think we are there are moments when although we sight what brings bad consequences we still haven’t reasoned enough to change ourselves, master the instincts and then we fall, but yet there is a teleological order that makes bad turn out to become good, since it is what can make even “failure the greatest teacher”. It has happened during other moments in the saga with other Jedi, masters can fail that at any stage in their Jedi discipline, but it seems some fans negate this emotional aspect and want to see them as if they were flawless machines that had already controlled all of their human nature by negation and not and not by conducting them to an optimal point, or who think it is easy to keep with the Force once one reached it, instead of being a lifetime process of challenges (look at Yoda, he is good humored even as a Force ghost, he achieved the integrality of his nature, emotions and individuality, without self-annihilation, just self-improvement). Luke died with all his potential, spending all of his energies in a Force projection that kept not only his legend but the way of the Force going on, in a more powerful way than would be a lightsaber clash (like when Ben Kenobi simply went calm with Vader, knowing it would be better that way, his spirit continued one with the Force, acting as part of it, guiding people and appearing in decisive moments). Other controversy is Rey, who appears to frolic effortlessly with Force abilities, and that seems like the same backlash Anakin had in the prequel trilogy, when he was born with a load of midichlorians. Also, people didn’t like the explanation about her parents, which seemed to have given it a sudden end. Regarding these questions, people have forgotten one theory, in which just like Anakin and the Chosen One prophecy, she may have been Force-conceived, without parents. The midichlorians were an interesting addition to the Star Wars and are at first incomprehensible because they don’t seem to link with the soul and the natural omnipresent Force: that is because we tend to ignore the spiritual realm of Star Wars, “death, yet the Force”; people are born with a capacity of Force sensitivity that is normally directly proportional to the quantity of them and can be estimated by it, but the confusion comes when considering them to be the cause of it while we cannot affirm that. Instead, it points to correspondence and interconnection between matter and spirit, but the midi are not the only condition for the sensitivity and it could be acquired and developed with effort by means of the pre-existence of the soul, reincarnation, etc. Because of this and more, it is worth the 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This film is not only an awful piece of storytelling in its own right, but also a complete F*CK YOU to fans of the original trilogy. I can't comprehend how this film has had such good reviews from the critics but am gratified to see the sheer number of fans giving it poor reviews. Leia Poppins, Luke being Not-Luke and dying on a rock from doing nothing but using the Force, an entire sub-story (in a film with very few plot lines) being entirely pointless and characters like Akbar being killed off with utter disregard are just a few of the things so very, very wrong about this sh*tstorm of a movie.

Suspension of disbelief is obliterated in the fist 10 minutes before the typical narrative structure gives way to several barely coherent threads that eventually result in everyone turning up at the same place, at the same time, but are otherwise entirely unrelated.<br/><br/>Luke doesn't seem to know what his own motivations are, nor Ray her reason for seeking him out other that he is apparently space Jesus. The ticking clock set up to give other characters a sense of urgency is so woefully contrived it has you wondering how the first order could conquer their way out of a wet paper bag. Vice-admiral "I'm in charge here boys" was played as a super **** for the sole purpose of the "but she was right all along" moment, except she wasn't, and could have eliminated a full 1/3rd of the movie by taking 20 seconds out her time to explain her plan to the one senior staff member who bothered to ask.<br/><br/>The film is plagued throughout with people just kinda showing up where they're needed. The sort of things that niggle at you "how did he get back on the ship" etc, and could easily have been cleared up with 5 seconds of footage but nay that was too much like coherent story telling. The disparate threads that make up the bulk of the movie veer from being far too vague and hand-wavy to being overly specific and come off as badly written fan fiction. The author only seeing fit to focus on the bits that interest them personally and glossing over the bulk of the actual story telling.<br/><br/><br/>The third and only act is a great visual spectacle, with genuinely high stakes, although the whole setting it up as Hoth 2.0 and then lampshading the same just came off as trying too hard.<br/><br/>The only saving grace is that Kylo "petulant emo kid" Ren is by far the most complex and interesting character the series has seen for a long time, and is for me at least now the main box-office draw. Also the visuals, which are exactly as flashy and expensive as you expect them to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Before the movies came out I kept seeing Mark Hamill interviews where he was trying to tactfully voice decent with the direction the movie was going. In one interview he actually states "I fundamentally disagree with everything (the writers) think about Luke." Man was he right. The Force Awakens left so many enticing questions to be answered, along with a bevy of mysterious characters who we all wanted to learn more about. The Last Jedi, not only fails to answer ANY important questions, it destroys the possibility or reason to ever answer them in a meaningful way (either through cheap and banal plot devices or outright character death). As in The Force Awakens the characters all have fast paced adventures while completely avoiding any interesting or meaningful character arcs. The movie is beautiful, but its all eye candy and no substance. Like eating a pile of real candy the initial sugar rush fades and you are left with nothing but the proverbial tummy ache. The more time I have to reflect on the film the more I think it was<br/><br/>1. Terrible.<br/>2. May actually have fundamentally broken the Star Wars world. Perhaps it can be saved, but at this point I can't see how. It looks like Star Wars will end not with a bang but with a whimper.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I will not bore you with painful details that have ruined my expectations. PLOT<br/><br/>The script is in a total disarray. You will see things that make 0 sense and you will struggle to find connecting links between events because of too many plot holes. Bombs "dropping" on space, First Order ships have no energy shields (really...?), Leia getting blown up -survives, drags off to outer space -freezes, comes back to life and flies back in THROUGH the energy shield? You will witness characters getting killed such funny and stupid deaths to a point that you'll almost be hearing the Benny Hill soundtrack (Snoke, Phasma?). Also, the majority of one-liners and humorous moments are so cringe-worthy, I am amazed that the people who edited this actually approved it.<br/><br/>VISUALS AND SOUND<br/><br/>Effects are probably the only redeeming thing of the movie but also probably the least important. It has a few very well directed scenes and iconic photography, especially with Luke facing the First Order walkers on the salty-surfaced planet. The beloved Star Wars music is sometimes used a bit out of place though.<br/><br/>SCRIPT - TIME AND PACING<br/><br/>This movie is long. And not in an enjoyable way; the first hour, I thought even if I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't have missed a whole lot. Towards the end, I was begging for the movie to wrap stuff up and end because I'd gotten tired of the endless cringe-worthy moments which seem to be increasing in frequency. The pacing of the movie is absolutely horrendous; some storylines take a few hours, others weeks. Some are unclear how much they take(?). This creates a lot of "WTF" moments in the audiences' minds as to "how did this happen?". Ray seems like she's been training with Luke for weeks but the events with the Resistance look like they last hours/a few days.<br/><br/>SCRIPT - "INNOVATIONS" AND CHARACTERS<br/><br/>In Force Awakens, we had a lot of new characters introduced, but The Last Jedi, viciously floors literally all of them and the ones that already were there. It introduces more characters who are completely and utterly useless, uninteresting and very flat (I'm looking at you Rose!). Ray's backstory seems destroyed, she's basically a completely uninteresting daughter of scum who sold her off for money. Snoke, one of the most intriguing villains we'll never know what did he do or where did he come from; at least not in a meaningful way. OVERALL<br/>This is a very bad movie. Although the visuals and sound effects are stunning, the movie is a soulless husk. Characters are uninteresting and even look bored, plotlines diverge to paths unknown for too long for no reason, and then drag on some more. Plot holes ruin the continuity of the movie and make the audience wonder "so what happened now?". Sense of humour is appalling and completely out of place.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Character</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">*You'll find my original take on the movie below as i've had a different perspective since seeing it a second time.<br/><br/>12/26/17 It's not perfect, but there are a lot more continuity connections than just watching it the first time. Character arc choices that I despised the first go around came into focus the second time through. Even the Snoke and Luke arc made much more sense; though I still feel like Rian Johnson threw a hail mary pass to episode 9 that is more a problem with the DIRECTOR and not the movie itself (and a sincere reason I don't ever want to see another Rian Johnson directed Star Wars movie).<br/><br/>Lines given the second time around worked (nominally;"Rebel Scum" still made my skin crawl and wanna throw-up a bit). Humor, while still contrived, didn't bother me as much. This brand of humor has no place in a Star Wars movie, but the second go I guess I just came to terms with it.<br/><br/>The biggest change for me was the plot and how much depth I missed in the first go around. The argument that it ignored everything from Episode 7 is false, that it doesn't tell the story in its own right is false and that it doesn't get us to episode 9 is a massive falsehood. The biggest crime The Last Jedi commits (and Rians greatest sin) is that everything is hinged on the answers Episode 9 has to cover.....which is a lot.<br/><br/>This isn't like the transition from A New Hope to Empire and how that lead to The Return of the Jedi. The empire is stung with the lost of the death star but the war rages on in empire. The rebels aren't destroyed in empire, nor are our heroes lost. If anything they too deal with turmoil and setbacks (and revelations), but their way forward is clear (as are the rebels as a whole). Jedi sums up empire and brings the series to a close (until then). The Last Jedi tries to do this but instead ends up being a stand alone story which was squeezed through a sieve and forced to be a bridge for the prior and the future, when really Johnson wanted to make his own movie with his own story. There is no place for this in Star Wars.<br/><br/>They are "episodes" sure but that is in name only. This series is just that--a long-running "LINEAR" story that must FULLY connect to the prior story and also be ready to line-up with the future installment as well as fit into the overarching narrative. Rian Johnson did not want to do this, I firmly believe that--which is why the movie is hated by the community at large. Not only this, but Johnson buries the literal previous trilogy (4/5/6) by upending the events of ALL participants, making them ALL failures. What a great feeling it is if you've watched these all your life. If that isn't overwhelming ego at work I don't know what is. At most, Rian Johnson should have been give just one of the "Star Wars Stories" to make. He could have done whatever he wanted to there, but with The Last Jedi; he was the absolute wrong choice.<br/><br/>Still, there are plenty of things episode 9 can (and will) use to make it all work and those things will (hopefully) vindicate episode 8. But that isn't good either. A future installment should NEVER justify the quality of the prior; Star Wars or not. I cannot truly sin the actors, the story or the movie at-large for the sins of the director. The movie itself does it's job, but only on a second viewing (which is why I also increased my score from a 6 to a 7). Do yourselves a favor, see it at least one more time.<br/><br/>*12/15/17The movie is far overrated for it's sake. The pacing was droll, the cinematography was dark (as in physically dark, you can't see much of what is happening half the time). Story told through imagery can be fine, but if everything is representative of something that needed to be told it gets oppressive. And that is what this move felt like; oppressive, bland and out of sorts with what it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>And that's not what I felt, the movie kept second guessing what it was or where it was going. Is it a Stars Wars movie or was it the evolution of the series into something else? I left the theater not knowing what the hell I just watched and not in the good way.<br/><br/>There is a disturbing trend happening with Disney's movies; they are all starting to taste like the same thing. Dialogue from the last jedi could easily fit into an Avengers movie. Humor and places like Canto Bight....I've seen it in Guardians of the Galaxy. That can't be the case with Star Wars. IT'S STAR WARS! The jokes were terrible. There needs to be some humor, but this? The fan service moments were cringeworthy and left a terrible taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>There's a really good reason Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver's performances have barely been covered in the early reviews of this movie; Neither really have ANY screen time when they do it's as side dressing to the bigger names. There's no kidding myself here with people not going to see this movie, but I promise you; you'll leave disappointed. Shame on you Disney and shame of what you've done to Star Wars</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Story is very lame.  All the new characters are boring and uninteresting.  Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher (RIP) acting is so bad and i mean so bad.  The big lead up/mystery of Snoke was a joke.  He literally dies before anything interesting is revealed.  Same goes for Rey's heritage.  She's just a daughter of drunken parents that left her for booze money.  Kylo is just a mental mess that needs anger management.  There is nothing for this franchise to go forward.  Basically Kylo wants to rule and Rey doesn't want him to rule.  I will not watch another one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A huge middle-finger to 40 years of fandom with a dose of terrible comedy and amazingly ham-fisted political messaging added on to boot. Where have you gone, George Lucas?

It has stunning visuals, great action, the cast is great, and a fantastic score from John Williams. Although it is a little slow at times, the film is very pleasing. Here are a few tips for the haters of this film: As Kylo Ren says in the film, "Let the past die. Kill it if you have to." For everyone who is saying that TLJ is "Ruining Star Wars" or "Killing the franchise," think about this: Star Wars is heading in a new direction. You can't expect it to be exactly the same as the original trilogy, otherwise it will feel old and bloated. They have to make changes for it to feel fresh and new. They have to introduce new ideas, characters, and concepts. I guess that the people who think that Star Wars is ruined are people who aren't able accept new facts and ideas that ACTUALLY WORK for the franchise. For everyone who is complaining about the Snoke scene: If we didn't have the prequels, we would know just as much about Palpatine as we do Snoke. Therefore, he isn't supposed to be a major player in the story. For people who thought the casino planet was unnecessary: Yes, it did slow the story down a little bit, but I think it humanizes the movie. Sometimes we fail at something we think needs to be done, but then we realize it was never necessary. I think it makes the film a little more relatable. For people who say "It destroys the original characters." Our favorite characters such as Luke, Leia, and Han are still human. They have human issues and problems pop up in their lives. So for those who keep saying that the film is ruining the characters because they didn't make them "perfect" and "flawless" like many people thought that they would become after Return of the Jedi, remember that these characters are humans and make mistakes and aren't god-like beings. I could go deeper into these, but I'm not going to. If you haven't seen the film yet and aren't sure what to do because of all the negative haters out there, don't listen to them. They think they can drag you away from the film and they want to bring down as many people as they can with them. Go watch this movie and see how great it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

First Star Wars Battlefront 2 with all the microtransactions and pay to win mechanic.<br/>I didn't think anything worse could happen. I underestimated Disney.<br/><br/>First what they ruin about the original trilogy: Han's character development in the OT has been completely undone. He's back to smuggling and being egotistical. His dead was incredibly stupid. Leia has had her republic for 30 years only to end up with less rebels and an empire that is less human than the OT one, has 2 clowns as Palpatine and Vader. Luke was a beacon of hope and someone who would always be there for friends and family. His life was rough but he became the hero the rebellion needed even if that meant his life was on the line. In TLJ you will learn that Luke becomes an utter failure with low self esteem, couldn't care less about his former friends/family and goes to a cage to die. On top of all that: Vader, Luke, Yoda, Obi-Wan and Palpatine are incredibly weak in the force if you see what an untrained Rey can do. She's completely overpowered and wins at everything. Mechanic? Np. Pilot? Np. Beat Luke and Kylo in combat, np. This destroys the entire 2 other trilogies and Star Wars in general.<br/><br/>The new characters do not get any character development. The story is stupid and unimaginative (has been done a gazzilion times in pretty much ALL sci-fi series). Can't they come up with something better with the money and writers who work for a blockbuster movie? This movie has no idea how space works (bombs falling down as if ships have enough gravity pull (death stars is an exception because of their HUGE mass). Leia floating around in Space for some time after not being hit by anything apparently. People opening the door to let her in: problems opening a door in space. Phasma was once again completly useless. Snoke was a total pushover. Force users have a "force aura" around them. Otherwise Jedi and Sith could just flip each others lightsaber off in duel or make them trip etc. Killing Snoke because he wasn't paying attention shouldn't be possible. Space and Star Wars? This movie doesn't get it.<br/><br/>Also Kylo Ren? Is he a joker character for whatever side needs him the most? He should be in a mental hospital.<br/><br/>It ruined the OT, it destroys loved characters, adds lackluster new characters, doesn't have a good story... Great shots though. Good CGI. I would rate this movie as being average. Probably rather direct to DVD. But bc it is a blockbuster with the Star Wars label which doesn't just destroys itself but the OT as well I cannot not give it a 0.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It should be pointed out that The Last Jedi seemed like a bloated, fragmented assortment of poorly connected scenes and little else. Furthermore, the ham-handed attempt at diversity and inclusion was so poorly executed and serves only to saddle TLJ as a movie that wanted to make a statement about social justice and not tell a good story. If Johnson’s vision was to kill the past then he has indeed succeeded. The deconstructed script effectively cut any ties to the episodes that came before and it was helped along by Disney’s filmmaking by committee, which appeared more interested in marketability and not in character and story development. If this were a relay race then Kathleen Kennedy, J. J. Abrams, Rian Johnson et. al. have dropped the baton.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

You might agree on some points (cinematography) and disagree on others (plot, character motivation), but how those individual aspects weigh into the overall impression of a movie can be completely different from person to person.<br/><br/>Initially, I glossed over many things I didn't like about this movie, because of the few things that I did like. But the more time passes, the more those few things fall apart upon further scrutiny. One example with a little bit of added detail: I liked the way Snoke manipulated both Rey and Kylo through their force connection, which he himself orchestrated, and how he baited Rey to go into the belly of the beast. When she realizes that she was played, it's too late. So they are in this situation, in the throne room, how can it be resolved? I don't think there are a lot of options (Rey dies, or Kylo decides to save her and fight Snoke and they try to escape, etc.). What happens instead is that Kylo kills Snoke (this seemingly omnipotent and omniscient being) in a way that simply seems cheap given Snoke's previously established strength in the force. Rey and Kylo both got played and the consequence? Nothing. Encounters like this feel scripted to a point where all that counts are aesthetics and furthering a certain plot point. It doesn't matter that Snoke is extremely powerful and his plan succeded. What matters is Rey and Kylo, so everything else needs to fall in place, whether it makes sense or not. This was a recurring theme in the movie.<br/><br/>Liked:<br/>- Yoda scene<br/>- R2D2 playing the Leia clip to convince Luke<br/>- Force connection scenes<br/>- Cinematography<br/>- Most of the principal acting<br/>- Luke questioning the Jedi code<br/>- A few other things that slip my mind<br/><br/>Disliked:<br/>- Entire Canto Bight subplot<br/>- The main plot which only served one purpose: adding a sense of urgency; but was devoid of logic in most parts<br/>- Rey fighting off several Elite Praetorian Guards, having gotten almost zero training by Luke (yes, I only say that because I can't handle a female Jedi protagonist /s)<br/>- Character motivations don't make sense<br/>- Gaping plot holes<br/>- Leia shoud've died or that scene never should've happened<br/>- Irrational lines that are supposed to evoke emotions (Rose to Fin: "you win by saving who you love, not destroying what you hate"; just after you prevent him from saving what HE loves by sacrificing himself in what would've been a great arch for Fin; and btw, how? By crashing into him in high speed mere meters from the front line of the First Order, what? What?!)<br/>- Space is not a vacuum (several instances of this)<br/>- Luke, the dude who believed in the good in Vader and was willing to die for it, is going to kill a child (his only nephew) because of a premonition.... yea, either flesh that change in his character out properly with more backstory or something (I get that they tried to rationalize it by having him say that it was an instinctive moment which he immediately regretted, but at least for me, that didn't work)<br/><br/>For most of the time in this movie, I was just not invested in the story or the characters. Not because I didn't want to be (quite the opposite actually: I like the characters established in TFW) but because so much of what was happening just wasn't making any sense to me. And you start realizing: nothing matters, there is a starting place for a few characters and they need to end up at a particular place by the end, but how that happens, everyhing in between, is of minor importance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It felt like I had paid to get punched in the brain for 2.5 hours. Fisher looked so different due to age and whatever she's paid for in her time falling apart I thought the "I changed my hair" line was their way of explaining why Leia looked so different in the universe when it was a new actor (then I saw in the credits it was actually her and looked it up because I couldn't beleieve it). New Han Solo "Popo" still comes across as the dorky loser that followed the cool kid everywhere (Han Solo) and then as soon as the cool kid fell out of the picture copied all his traits because they didn't have their own personality, and copied it so poorly it wasn't just a traditional "fraction of" the cool kid, but a performance so poor it ends up going into the negatives.<br/><br/>Kylo Ren has some early-puberty mustache growth going in several scenes. Adam Driver can do proper facial hair so I don't know if he just forgot to shave for those takes and they were like "who cares nobody will notice", or if it's supposed to be an extension of the immaturity of his character.<br/><br/>Mark Hamill seemed like he was reading right off the page after waking up for almost all of his material. He's more lively in interviews about Last Jedi than he is in Last Jedi.<br/><br/>The movie itself is like some trash internet fanfic got picked up as an official screenplay for some reason. I went with people which is the only reason I saw it, and the only reason I didn't walk out. The guy that called me a "negative nancy" for saying it probably wouldn't be very good when he asked before it started, ended up needing to be woken up at the end because it was so bad, he fell asleep.<br/><br/>I feel bad for these new actors knowing their greatest acting achievement will be starring in the worst Star Wars movies (to date), and then I remember how much they were probably paid.<br/><br/>The best is definitely over though... walking out of TLJ, I felt the same way I did when I heard Trump won the election. At least Trump prepped me for other life disappointments... if not for that, who knows what I might've tried doing to myself when I got home from TLJ.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson is bound to serve as the punchline for every hardcore fan's joke over the next decade, as Lucas was for the Prequels. His ideas for the film and its characters are new and interesting, particularly Mark Hamill's Luke, who takes a unique path throughout the film that is different than expected. Does it work? Sort of. In fact, most of the new ideas do work, and expand Star Wars in new directions. But there are plenty of occurrences that left me disappointed. The Finn and Rose ark feels forced, and adds on an entire half-hour that proves to be unnecessary later on. A particular scene involving our princess Leia, played by the late Carrie Fisher, though somewhat awesome, feels bizarre. However, the most disappointing aspect, one that adds to my "terrible mess" conclusion, is that most of the questions left by The Force Awakens are ignored here. It seems that Johnson was focused more on providing something new than he was continuing the story. The technological elements of The Last Jedi are great, as expected, with some of the best CGI in recent memory, and great motion capture work from Andy Serkis. The cinematography is wonderful, Johnson's direction is fresh, and the performances are easily the best of the series - Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and Mark Hamill especially. The Last Jedi is a great movie, just not a great Star Wars movie. It works most of the time, yet many plot points don't fit the world established by JJ Abrams, who will have a lot on his hands when making Episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And also the least 'Star Wars-y' Star Wars movie. The creators have destroyed the soul of Star Wars. Credit to Mark Hamill for speaking out and admitting that Luke Skywalker is not the Luke Skywalker that he knew. Sadly, this will be remembered as the movie that knocked Star Wars from its pedestal among fans. The few memorable moments are only memorable because they are utterly cringe worthy. The new characters are abominations. I can only presume that Disney/Lucasfilm only employ cowards or Yes Men nowadays, because that's the only explanation as to why no-one behind the scenes spoke up and pointed out to the senior people at Disney/Lucasfilm what an absolute atrocity they were creating. The soundtrack is great though, so it gets one star for the soundtrack.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

After seeing „The Last Jedi“ i felt  compelled to say something,  to give a „heads up“  to anyone who wants to go and watch it. Don’t. Don’t go.  Don’t give it any money.  Wait for it, wait for it when it’s free.  I fell ashamed for paying for it, for feeding the beast.<br/>Everything  in this movie  the „Plot“ ,the characters, the „humor“ and the porgs, all of it has a  singular purpose –money.  The entire film seems to be made of unconnected ideas that were approved by „would you pay to see this“ polls after which they tried to connect it all by adding  confusing and implausible scenes between them (including force Skype and improved force Skype at the end),   because of  this plot holes pop up  every single time any of main characters try to do anything . I won’t  list them all, there is simply too many, instead i will only mention the most important one, the one that the entire story hinges on.<br/>- The inability of the First order armada of Star Destroyers and the Capital ship of „Supreme“ Leader Snoke to catch one rebel ship because it’s  a little faster than them, this being said one minute after the entire armada drops out of Hyperspace at light speed. Again... Light Speed. That is it. That’s the plot. The characters have no development, some don’t  even have any importance, Fin and Rose can easily be removed with little or no consequence to the „plot“ , but they do have importance money wise. A lot of people say that Disney is being too PC,  i guarantee it has nothing to do with political correctness, only money,  characters that pass the „would you pay to see this“ polls get screen time, and those that don't  get killed off.  Captain Phasma the  commander  of the First Order's legions gets maybe  60 seconds of screen time more than the „porgs“, one is for story purposes and one is merchandise. Guess who gets killed off.<br/>All this being said i am not opposed of movies earning money. I simply think that movies should earn money because they are good.<br/>Movies  shouldn't  be good just because they bring in the money.<br/>Ultimately i left the movie theater disappointed and confused and with the wish i didn't see the thing a saw.<br/>This is the last Star Wars movie i will ever pay for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Thanks, Disney, my expectations about you were right. 0 points for you. It's seems to me, that people forgot or even didn't know, that movies are stories at first and visuals at second. And this is second disapointing aspect of film: A ridiculous exchange from plot to visuals. 0 points for you, Disney. Repeating a scenes from original trilogy is not an issue here. It's just a symptom of one of the worst problems of this film: Lack of understanding and appreciation of source material. I don't know if director is a Star Wars fan, but I know something for sure: Fans never mix their favorites with mud! 0 points for you, Disney.<br/>And in the end... we have... 0 points!

It's an exciting and humorous film with a couple of plot problems and some poor editing. There are thing to dislike about this film, but there is also a great deal to like. If you're deeply invested in the star wars lore and charachters, you might be upset by its complete lack of fan service and errative plot. if you just want a fun time at the cinema, it's one of the best films of the year. I'm giving it 10 stars to counteract the astonishing brigading of undeserved one star reviews. This film is not perfect, but there is no way it deserves less than 5 stars. At worst, it is average.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

He troll'd all of us with the Last Jedi. It's hard to fully like or dislike this film. There's some good stuff like: interesting relationship between Rey and Ben S(w)olo, all scenes including Luke Skywalker and of course Poe Dameron. On the other hand Mr. Johnson gave us a really big "GO F%$K YOURSELVES!" with things like: giving screen time to characters that no one cares about (Rose, Holdo), wasting Finn, DJ (the hackerman, yea they cast Del Toro for this trash role), choosing not to develop anyone (except Kylo) from "the bad guys" side (i didn't like Phasma or Snoke very much but C'MON what was the point of their being in the franchise if they ended up like that?) .<br/>We've got two movies in fact. The predictibale, boring one with rebels fighting Imperi... sorry, I mean FIRST ORDER. Also sub-plot of two love birds at the casino trying to find something to do and almost every "we can be as funny as MCU" scene (i don't know for sure but i should put here this specific part where Leia turns out to be Superman) . The second movie is the one with Rey learning things and training, Luke being grumpy and/or awesome while using new force tricks and Kylo developing some personality. Also we can add here moments with exchange of views between Leia and Poe, which weren't that bad . Although entire movie was long, it didn't feel like it. Maybe action was going a little bit too fast at some points.<br/>I definitely going to rewatch Episode VII at least 2 times and place it somewhere next to the Revenge of the Sith, Return of the Jedi and Rogue One. Just like the Age of Ultron (i'm purposely comparing this to other Disney film) it was a disappointment at some parts; it has elements that were good enough to keep viewers entertained but as a whole it could've been done much better.<br/>One can say that Rian was only inspired by Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and stories from Legends however he was still keeping the old stuff just so we want to "buy" his movie and in the end not much of original content get through to be remembered in this mess.<br/>Well, to be fair, at least this one is better than Farce Engorges (on the other hand that's not a big achievement).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie is probably one of the best of the whole saga. I did not enjoy VII, but this one is really outstanding. Of course the characters could have taken another route, and of course Luke is not what we would expect, but isn't the surprise one of the main goodies of the movies? The story is not bad - it is just what we didn't expect (and I think it is good). There are clichés, but show me a SW which hasn't. The ship combat scenes are THE BEST among all SW movies. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews - give the movie a chance, and you probably will be positively surprised.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

People were seriously falling asleep or playing on their phones during the movie. The audience was quiet -- not reacting or cheering the way they did during Rogue One, The Force Awakens, or Revenge of the Sith. I found it hard to resist the urge to play with my phone or nap during the movie, and I normally love sci-fi movies! I've seen all the Star Wars movies multiple times.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is it was clearly written and directed by someone who does not understand Star Wars, has ADHD, and does not understand human emotion. The movie constantly jumps around, attempts to accomplish too many simultaneous story lines, blows away the boundaries of what is believable in sci-fi movies, and completely ignores emotional attachment to characters. Worse, every confrontation I was looking forward to turned out to be completely anticlimactic due to being handled wrong, pointless delays, and force powers turned into pure magic.<br/><br/>The Last Jedi was bad. It's a pretty movie that definitely lives within the Star Wars visual universe. However, it was not up to Star Wars storytelling quality. The only thing good about the movie was the dynamic between Rey and Kylo -- that's all. I do not want to see any more Star Wars movies by Rian Johnson. I would happily take George Lucas back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7985062"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">As bad as the movie is with the many valid reasons people have expressed for not liking it, when the dust settles I think this movie will be seen as an impostor: Being advertised under the Star Wars brand but without the heart and soul of the original movies. What’s even worse is the fact that Star Wars has now become a politicised propaganda weapon to influence the minds of the young.<br/><br/>The OT became so popular because at its core was a simple story of the archetypal struggle between good and evil told through the intergenerational relationships of the Skywalker family. It’s no accident that George Lucas was able to craft such a powerful story. He was an excellent student of Joseph Campbell and anyone who’s read Campbell’s ‘The Hero With a Thousand Faces’ will have gained a deeper appreciation of not just the OT, but story-telling in general. Hollywood has either become incapable, or more likely, unwilling to produce stories that emotionally resonate with audiences as they don’t want to inspire, only to mindlessly entertain. This is at the core of the continuing decline of Hollywood. The same slow decline and desolation has occurred within the music industry over the past few decades.<br/><br/>As a vegan I care deeply about animal welfare, as do the vast majority of people. However, the scene with Chewie and the roast porg totally undermined the characterisation of Wookies. As Han Solo told the droids in A New Hope, Chewie had been known to pull people’s arms out of their sockets for no other reason than mild irritation. Did this scare you as a kid in the 80s? Or course not, it made the Wookies seem more formidable as allies in the fight against the seemingly unstoppable evil Empire. Disney’s infantilisation of children does them a disservice in the long run.<br/><br/>In many ways this is a movie of its time, whereas the OT is timeless. The great hope is that Generation Z will see the effect that cultural marxist poison has had on the Millennial generation and become immune to the propaganda. There is hope that this is happening already.<br/><br/>I’ll finish with a note about the character assassination of Luke and will echo what another reviewer stated, ‘The obvious deliberate deconstruction of one of the most positive male archetypal characters of the last 50 years within popular culture is a cultural marxist’s wet dream.’ Stories about idealised heroes following their own Hero’s Journey are as old as culture itself. Myths help us to understand our own natures as we struggle along our own journey arcs. Disney going their own way with new characters within the SW Universe is fine but not if it means the destruction of what came before. Nothing can justify what they did with this beloved character. They should never have brought the old characters back if this was what they were going to do to them. As a lifelong massive SW fan, it pains me to say the same thing about the movies in general.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not only does it disrespect the Force Awakens by undoing all of the mystery it presented, but more importantly it disrespects the previous trilogies and the Star Wars lore all together.

That many people can't be stupid enough to believe this movie actually has good character development. I really am concerned for the future of, not just Star Wars, but of entertainment in general if this is the case. There was nothing that made me feel good about this movie. The humor made me cringe and was totally out of place. There was a complete lack of any real dramatic moments. Too many inconsequential scenes and new characters. The runtime could have been cut by nearly an hour and nothing would have changed. Just way too many bad choices on the part of the writers. I am all for making something new and unpredictable. Just don't do it at the expense of your plot. I'm not even looking forward to the next one now. I don't recommend seeing this movie in the theater. Wait till it's free on netflix. Disney does not deserve your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's not a movie, its a starwars themed political ad for feminism/ white man hate. The longer I think about the movie the madder I get that they ruined starwars. You don't have to make every man in a movie out to be an idiot and or Nazi to have strong female characters. Kennedy at Lucas films has to go and RJ needs to have his trilogy deal revoked I won't be watching it if he or Kennedy are involved. beyond that, it's still poorly written and throws the continuity of star wars out the window. I can't believe the character assassination of luke. not even mark himself agrees with how they did luke, sad just sad....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Unique visuals pair up with powerful themes to deliver a worthy follow up to Force Awakens. The film develops Kylo and Rey in interesting ways and TLJ is not afraid to take creative chances. However, it is something of a muddled film. Like Rogue One, TLJ is missing a clear narrative arc and the story seems to swing from one plot to another without much coherence. Once again Finn is completely unnecessary to the plot, which is disappointing considering how much potential his backstory offers. The movie is bloated with a long side plot that amounts to nothing and only serves to distract from the more compelling lead narrative. In the end, I wish they'd developed a more focused story, but nonetheless, The Last Jedi is an exciting film and well worth a watch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Most of the movie is on a timer, which make every scenes counts in terms of pace. But you go to Rey and Luke from time to time, which slow down the timer. It's like watching two movies with two different paces, that get to assemble in the end. That's an unusual style and some might not like it, but it works well in my opinion. The FX are all amazing from space to on planet. Some of the distant scenes between Rey and Ben, later Luke are done with simplicity and are very efficient that way. Even the creatures feels more organics to their surroundings. I found interesting that some powers can be used in both ways. There might be debates that Luke in the end use a power from the Dark Side. But like he implied they are not all exclusive to one side of the force or one person. In the end, I wasn't very satisfied with Rey parentage or lack of good explanation regarding her powers. Although Yoda says she already know everything...at this point any explication would come too late to be satisfying. I wasn't badder by any critters, I didn't mind them. They provided good humor at key times, in a very serious film. But there was a lot to digest in this movie, maybe too much...The role of Del Toro was a little bit out of place but yet logical in the circumstances. His role was intriguing and very well acted on his part. I would love to see more...I give it a 85%. Second view: I though that the Leia in space scene wasn't particularity good, in a sens that if she did received training they could have mentioned it, but out of the blue...that's a hard sell. I was intrigue that the First Order didn't hyperspace the rebel fleet in front of them but decided to wait for them to exhaust their fuel. I think it's the first time we see that resources in Star Wars are valuable in space. Meaning spaceship, energy...risking small ships doesn't mean much for them (as long as they are in range) but obviously the big one are much more precious and limited to move. The same did apply with the Rebels fleet. So, I appreciated that Johnson put some realistic notions to space (including the X-Wing turning and acceleration). Luke did use the same power as Snoke in the end, but he did it in much larger scale. It follow a certain logic that he payed for it. And Ren, well...he acted just like a Sith. He killed his master (after Snoke insulted his intelligence), try to get an apprentice. I still think that Rey wasn't a nobody, I think Ren was just trying to use her negative feelings. Anyway I enjoy it a second time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The usual themes are still present (family, hope, betrayal, trying to find your place in the universe), but many of the usual Star Wars tropes are gone or subverted. The script really shines, and while the story gets bogged down in places, it is still petty string. Much better than the prequels (people forget just how bad they were), and as good as The Force Awakens. As good as the original trilogy? Maybe, as time (and the third and final movie) will tell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Or lets you are just a fan of the movies, meaning all seven then you should still disagree with the choices made for this episode.  Only people I see liking this movie are those who never seen Star Wars or know absolutely nothing about the cannon.  Sad cause this director took years upon years of not only a great series but beliefs that have been developed for some people most of their lives and basically through it out the window.  I'm surprised Disney allowed these type of changes. After all of the work put into tying the cartoons like Rebels and The Clone Wars alongside the movies, THEN to allow this tragedy to occur is ridiculous and sad.  The excuse of stating we are trying to get away from the Skywalker era is poor, you can easily do so and make still make it interesting.  I mean even Star Wars Rogue which was a hit had only one Sith appear and was only for a short time and was done so in order to tie it in with another movie.  I honestly just do not understand why this was allowed to happen, shame on you Disney and thanks Rian you are now part of JJ Abrams, I am here to destroy legendary hits.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The story is non existent. If you look at the beginning and the end of the movie the only difference is that Luke and Snoke died. Literally nothing has happened. The movie has 0 character development. Rey is the most boring protagonist in the history of cinema. Finn and Rose are on completely irrelevant sub-plot that does nothing for the movie. This movies is a complete **** with the only decent things being the music and a couple of special effect.<br/><br/>And thanks to disney for **** PORGS that add nothing to the movie other then to sell some **** toys.

And I was NOT disappointed!<br/><br/>Though Rian Johnson’s story and direction are somewhat controversial in some circles, overall I liked the direction we are going in.  We left Rey with Luke in The Force Awakens and find Luke as a dissolutioned former Jedi who just wants to die on an island in the armpit of the galaxy far far away.  And Rey, shocked by this attitude of a man she’s idolized, tries to wake him up.  You can’t walk away from trouble and though you may have inadvertently caused it, you still have responsibility to make it right.  I feel that’s the lesson between Luke and Rey.<br/><br/>Legends change – we find anyone can use the Force, not just certain individuals.  And Rey has the most sensitivity and the most power, and is on par with her antagonist Kylo Ren.  Ren, like Luke, is a torn individual.  He has a Force connection with Rey who communicates with him.  That Rey tries to see Ren’s side of the story is telling and so is Luke’s tale with a lot to do with his relationship with both Ren and Rey.  Flawed characters trying to do what they think is “the best” but eventually Rey decides – in the main throne room of Snoke’s ship. Snoke comes across as a villain who seems to have all the cards in his favor.  His Dark Side Force power is more powerful than Rey and Ren.  They both have a plan for Snoke.  And their lightsaber battle with the Praetorian Guard is worth the price of admission! Forced?<br/><br/>We finally get to see a final confrontation with Ren and Luke Skywalker himself.  Luke seems invincible, and Ren wants his blood.  How this turns out with shock you. Another controversial scene must do with the remnants of the Rebel Alliance attempting to escape from the First Order armada and are getting picked off, one at a time, as the Rebels limp towards their base.  There are side adventures with Rose (new character, she really steps up and takes the film) and her relationship with Finn – at first seems to have hero worship and later saves his life.  Final Thoughts”<br/><br/>OK, I’m rambling , but really guys and gals remember this is fiction!  Some suspension of disbelief is required.  Johnson turns the Force mythology on its ear.  And who is the Last Jedi?  Can you guess?<br/><br/>Highly recommended!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

All the questions set up by Force Awakens get disappointing answers or don't get touched upon at all. Tons of plots holes. There are a few great moments but they have no real weight immediately afterwards or looking back years from now because half of it is illogical. This is a rental only. Don't waste your money at the theater unless you can get in for less than $10. Don't support Disney on this garbage quality writing covered in eye-candy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Easiest way to make sense of them and figure out how it really rates as a movie to to simply pay attention to the way that postive reviews are written. You will see a LOT of "Didn't make sense but LOVED it" and "There were tons of odd moments that made me cringe but GREAT film". Ask yourself why even all the positive reviews of 8,9 and even 10 tell you how awkward it was and how they are 'taking a new direction' with the series in this 'turning point' film.<br/><br/>Those are the kindest possible terms for a movie that took a massive steaming dump on all the things we loved about Star Wars prior to this. Heroes? All of the things you thought you knew about the Lore and Characters will be completely washed away by the end of the film. Is Luke a brave hero who risked his life to save his father or a broken, selfish and cowardly vagrant? if you believe the former prepare to be disappointed and confused.<br/><br/>To keep this spoiler free I will not be listing all of the times this film make me confused,angry and hurt. Read the reviews yourself and you'll see the truth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But it will never be Star Wars without George Lucas.  From the Fanfiction Awakens to this movie, the characters developed in the original trilogy are ignored and poorly written.  all of the new characters fail at everything they were trying to do.  Rose stopping Fin from being a hero was terrible.  Luke considering killing Darth Snape is too out of character.  Turning the empire into Nazis is laughable.  This was not Star Wars, this was Disney Wars and has ruined my opinion of Disney with Star Wars.  Can someone start a petition for George Lucas to write his own versions of episodes 7, 8, and 9?  We don't even need films, just books of the real story with Kira the Jedi.  But as for now, all I can think is Step into the grand tour, grand tour grand tour, step into the grand tour, Star Wars GT!  I hope Star wars bombs from here on out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Meeting Luke again, after a long, real life had taken its toll on his previously sunny persona, was very rewarding. His showdown with Kylo Ren was exhilarating and one of the best confrontations in Star Wars, an analog to the Luke-Vader exchange at the end of the Empire Strikes Back. The interactions between Rey and Kylo were really interesting, revealing more depth in each. Kylo turning on Snoke was a real surprise, as was his subsequent turn on Rey. All in all this was exactly the type of epic, internal and external battle between good and evil that has made Star Wars an awesome universe to visit and reflect in. There were some imperfections, of course. I didn't think that the side-trip to the casino fit very well with the flow of the film, for example. And some of the Leia-Holdo-Poe dialog was stilted. But overall it was a great movie, and I look forward to seeing it again soon :D.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If you forget the original 3 films it is supposed to follow exist, then this movie is great, although not perfect. It is a great film for a newer generation of movie go-ers and fans, but a bitter pill to swallow for long standing fans. As a fan, I give this film a 4.5. They destroyed Luke, but considering it is obviously targeting a new audience, I'll score it a 6. The Last Jedi has the Marvel humor this generation has come to expect in movies. Nothing can be taken seriously, because apparently this generation likes to live in bubbles where everything is Disney princess and princesses and happiness. A dumb joke follows almost every moment that should taken seriously.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7983999"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I think I can sum up my feelings about this movie as: entertained, but disappointed. It is truly an entertaining film: the visuals, the musical score, and the space battles. All fun and worth my money if this were a generic sci-fi flick. But this movie fails considerably as a Star Wars movie. The Last Jedi somehow pulls off an incredible feat by conflicting not only with the original 6 movies, but also The Force Awakens, which concludes 35 seconds before this movie begins. Having different writers undoing what the previous movies set up is not a formula for success. The Good: I was absolutely annoyed with Disney's decision to reboot Episode 4 and call it Episode 7. I give TLJ some credit for not being an obvious rip off of Episode 5, but they narrowly straddled that line. Some scenes are obviously lifted from ESB, particularly the AT-AT battle on the white, desolate planet. But at least they were presented in a different order this time. Kylo Ren was very well written; as a matter of fact, he’s the only character they developed in this movie. I also felt like the music was kicked into high gear this time around. My only complaint was that it wasn't new music, just old scores we've heard before. The movie also had some pretty good fight scenes, such as with the new imperial guard. The space battles were exciting, culminating with the hyperspace ramming scene which was one of the coolest things I'd ever seen in Star Wars. However, it opens up a much bigger problem that I'll address in a bit.<br/><br/>Despite the good, there are many places where TLJ misses the mark, and sometimes undoes what was established in movies prior. Disney’s fingerprints are all over this because there were so many bad attempts at humor, even in serious scenes. I can’t believe there was a 'your mom' joke - prank call in Star Wars.. and it was right before a big space battle. Horrid. Finn and Rose are completely useless and their subplot drags the movie on for an extra 45 minutes. As much as I want new concepts in Star Wars, the writers have to consider how they fit into the rest of the canon. Going back to the hyperspace ramming scene, it just completely changes the game for how Star Wars battles should take place. Why bother risking fleets to destroy a death star when you can just take a bunch of large, empty ships and hyperspace ram it? Besides concepts like that, the writers took extreme liberties in their portrayal of Luke Skywalker. The way Luke behaves in this movie, you'd think you were watching a deranged clone or homeless Mark Hamill. I don't understand why Episode 7 set up this huge search mission involving pieces of a map if Luke reveals that he never wanted to be found. That completely aborts the ENTIRE plot of TFA which was searching for missing pieces of a map to Luke. So where’d Max Von Sydow get the map? Who knows, because TLJ doesn’t address it. Furthermore, I don't understand how Luke can redeem the most feared tyrant in the galaxy, Vader, but fantasizes about killing his own nephew (in his bedroom) before he's ever done anything wrong. That completely erased the conclusion of Luke’s character arc that took place through Eps 4-6. That's no Luke Skywalker. That is complete shenanigans.<br/><br/>Hardly any of the questions left open from TFA are followed. Rian Johnson faked the audience out by waving off the mysteries (and plot holes) JJ Abrams created in TFA. But by doing so, he left a void of backstory surrounding nearly everything we've seen on screen since TFA. Very poorly done. Rey's mysterious parents and missing last name? None of it mattered -- she's simply Jedi Jesus for no reason. Snoke, the man who turned the galaxy upside down and corrupted Ben Solo? Dead within the first half of the movie. Just destroyed Death Star #3? Doesn't matter, there’s still an infinite First Order fleet and the Resistance is even weaker than before, somehow. In fact, they STILL haven't bothered explaining the Resistance/F.O. conflict at all. They eventually go back to saying "rebels" in this movie, so I really have no idea what's going on. So all in all, The Last Jedi improves a bit on the originality side of things. I was certainly entertained. But the writers failed to fit this movie in with the greater Star Wars continuity. Old characters and their relationships have been sacrificed for ticket sales. Space battles have been completely rendered useless now that we can hyperspace kamikaze. And bizarrely, Leia was not given a send off and is still alive in the film, despite Carrie Fisher's passing. I just don't recognize this new brand of Star Wars anymore. I think it is entirely meant for new fans only, because clearly no attention is being paid to the source material. I expect more writer shenanigans when the reigns go back to JJ for episode 9, so more time will be spent answering/obfuscating things introduced in this movie instead of telling a new story. This may be where I finally get off the Disney Star Wars train.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In so many moments I was amazed with goosebumps about some unexpected turn of events, that I personally didn't expect but thought were fitting and just amazing.<br/><br/>A movie that I'm going to rewatch as soon as I can.

I'll give this movie a single start for just existing and the extra one only for how beautifully rendered it is. And that's about all that's right with this one. The Force Awakens rode on the hate for the prequels and an overwhelming sense of nostalgia and got by just rehashing the best parts of the erstwhile first 3 movies. What exactly is Rian Johnson's explanation or motivation to turn a decades-old mythology into his personal playground and how pray did Disney go ahead with this? Characters mouth incredulous dialogue (some of it captioning action on the screen), others throw hissy fits, some others decide to sacrifice themselves at the altar of temporary relief to their armies only to be thwarted by others with secret crushes on them. Backstories and plots drawn up in Force Awakens are decimated into smithereens like Alderaan. Mark Hamill, bless his hamming soul, is a classic 80s actor - unsubtle, upstages co-performers and clearly guns for longer screen time by slowing down dialogue delivery and throwing in a dozen or so pauses, glares and grimaces. His directors in the original trilogy probably recognised this and so gave him tight, sharp scenes to work with. Rian Johnson succumbs to the fanboy-as-director syndrome and lets Mark do his thing hoping that nostalgia will lull us all into not expecting a performance worthy of a 2017 film. Oscar Isaacs makes up for poor writing by being the film's only hormonal teenager stuck in an adult's body. Daisy Ridley starts and ends the film confused. Adam Driver should consider taking Kylo Ren off caffeine. Carrie Fisher reveals a superpower at the most inopportune moment. At which point, I thought Guardians of The Galaxy might make an appearance. Because by then, we'd already been subjected to some dialogue clearly inflicted by JossWheddonitis. If you're going to be honest then call this Star Wars Rebooted or something so true followers like me can make a choice and stay way. This is just dishonest, play-to-the-gallery filmmaking backed by a machinery that knows a billion bucks is out there to be made But here's the truth. Episode 9 is going to struggle at the box office, now that the trust and love for this saga has all but been put to waste.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

WTF? Why? Because its promote feminism and hate toward males (and rich ppl)? Because of so called diversity... i wonder what would be the score without all that mary sue bs. When i look at this new "star wars" movie or new star trek TV show i can see that actuall quality doesnt matter anymore as long as you push right opinions and propaganda. So why is this worst star wars movie ever created? Is it only because of leftie agenda? Is this movie just a victim of evil alt right macho males? NOPE this movie has so many problems that even if all actors were white hetero ar*ans it would not save it and i would still hate it equally. Lets see... lore breaking bs, terrible jokes, annoying new cast and characters, ridiculous villains (pls first order sounds like some cheap fan fiction anyway... you should just do a new star wars trilogy about yuuzhan vong invasion those are real badasses not these space nazi wannabes), boring story lines with too much plot holes and no real impact, good characters wasted or even intentionally destroyed (like luke himself... because disney needs you to focus on mary sue, who is now most likely strongest jedi and best sword fighter and best force user and best anything), new aliens exist only to sell toys to kids, rebels have super thick plot armour and even thought they have apparently no tactical or military knowledge they always manage to win (i know SW isnt military scifi but pls it still has war in its name it doesnt have to be total garbage), soundtracks, acting and battles are all mediocre and theres really not a single good thing i can praise. I really love old trilogy i like prequels and i was able to survive EP VII (it was bad but with potential) and i read a lots of SW books... i may not be most hardcore fan but i still really like the lore and this was just utter insult and slap in the face. BTW: its really not about some blind disney hate i still like them for creating MCU and few other good movies and rogue one was amazing (with ten time better female character BTW) and i think that SW still can be save (not this trilogy but maybe the next one) but you disney ceo guys really have to kick Johnson off and find someone who actually love and know the lore then you have to stop promoting PC-BS and rather focus on creating good movie. Diversity isnt about mary sue female characters and lame incapable male characters...   also sorry for my english not my native language....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Some of the acts are straight copies of these movies, Crait = Hoth and Snoke Throne room exact copy of Emperor even some of the dialog straight copy. Vader killed the Emperor, and vader wannabe Kylo kills Snoke. Are you seeing the trolling yet. The main act of ESB is about the falcon not being able to go light speed to get away from the Empire's fleet, TLJ main act is about the good guys not able to get away from the Empire by going light speed. This movie also had Dagobah with yoda and the jedi leaving while not being fully trained in the force just like Luke in ESB.<br/>TLJ even has Bespin in it. Remember ESB has the heroes trying to find the help of a shady/scoundrel character who may or may not help them and ends up betraying them to the Empire. DJ = Lando.<br/>The audience needs to take your Star Wars beer googles off and realize TLJ is a straight copy of ESB and RotJ with Act 1 Hoth being moved to Act 5. They even go as far to troll the fan boys by "It's Salt" to point out its not snow and it's your fan boy tears at the end of this parody.<br/><br/>It was nothing more then a SWJ propaganda movie. Every male in this movie was made to look like an idiot and needed a strong women character to tell them what to do. This movie contradicts itself "you must kill the past" nonsense. If you must kill the past then why is everything about this movie a straight copy of the OT? Both stories so far are copies, the ships are copies, it has vader/anakin = Kylo Ren, it has emperor = Snoke, it has Luke = Rey, both from a desert planet and come from nothing.<br/><br/>The hardcore SW fans need to realize Rian and Kathleen trolled you and made the first 3 movies pointless. The 1000 year prophecy of bringing balance to the force last maybe 30 years and The Empire vs Rebel face-off was meaningless and only to repeat itself 30 years later with a direct retelling.﻿</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7983510"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">A subversion of tropes to the point where nothing matters<br/><br/>The Force Awakens, as safe, fan-servicing and nostalgia-based it was, made at least one thing right - it set the stage for next movies due to the mysteries it touched but didn't bother to explain. Who is Snoke? What ancient powerful being is he? Where did he hide all these years? Who are Rey's parents? Why did they leave her in the middle of a **** nowhere? Why is she so powerful quick learner in everything? Was she trained in the ways of the Force, but doesn't remember? Why Luke is gone? If he doesn't want to be bothered, why did he leave a map to his seclusion? Most of these questions constitute plot holes actually, and big parts of the TFA make sense only if next episodes explain it in a satisfactory way. Star Wars fans had a lot of material to speculate and craft sometimes crazy and head spinning theories. Which is good, since that gave hope that Sequel Trilogy may have some depth, smart plot-twists, and earned dramatic moments.<br/>And here comes Rian Johnson with the Episode 8: The Last Jedi. Do you remember the final scene of the TFA, you know, that tense, shot from multiple angles scene, in which Rey's and Luke's facial expressions and body languages signalized that **** is serious? The very first scene set on that island in the TLJ is a direct continuation of that scene. What does Luke do, when Rey gives him the lightsaber? Throws it away like a an empty can. Shocking? Yeah, propably. Unexpected? You bet. But is it unexpected in a good way? Hell no. It's stupid, it's cheating, it's like writers didn't watch the TFA. It undermined the importance of everything what happened in the TFA that lead to the final scene. And it's only the beginning. Want to know who Snoke is? Nevermind, we kill the guy in the middle of the movie without hinting any backstory. Want to know who are Rey's parents? It doesn't matter, most propably nobody. And what about the map? What map? We have revised that story line, now it's Ressistance that sent Rey to Luke.That's propably the greatest sin of this movie - it dismisses it's own direct predecessor and throws away almost all hinges of the story set in the TFA, making the TFA nonsensical and pointless.<br/><br/>Characters are too dumb too frequently, inconsistent, or their actions are inconsequential anyway for the sake of the plot<br/><br/>Rey thought it's a good idea to go alone to the Snoke's ship and surrender in order to turn Kylo Ren. Did she think that they have so strong bond that she can do this alone? Even if she succeeds, how do they escape, if no rare event, like being hit by lightspeed bullet, occurs?<br/>Snoke sets and exploits a force connection between his emotionally unstable apprentice and Rey to hunt down a hermit on a distant planet, who decided to wait for death in solitude anyway.<br/>Admiral Holdo hides her plan from hot headed, known for authority questioning Poe Dameron, without other reason than to force Poe to mutiny.<br/>Finn's and Rose's side quest is inconsequential at best or even makes things worse.<br/>Leia knows better then we do that she's there only for an exposition.<br/>Kylo Ren smashes an elevator with his helmet due to his emotional turmoil which he cannot hide and later proves himself a master of occlumency.<br/><br/>Nonsensical bits and pieces<br/><br/>TLJ also introduced a very dangerous way of destroying things in a very efficient way. Don't take me wrong, it's a great idea to make a bullet from ship with hyperdrive and just smash it against enemy's dreadnaught or flagship. It's desperate, it's spectular, it suits well the Rebels (erm... Ressistance). It's dangerous because it undermines every previous attempts to destroy big ships. It seems that no one needed to find a weak spots and make complicated plans to destroy, let's say, Death Stars or other spherical weapons of mass destruction, just one ship with a hyperdrive and working autopilot (or a crew willing to sacrifice) is enough.<br/>In the first scene Ressistance is dropping bombs on the dreadnaught, defying laws of physics and established technological level.<br/>Writers try to make a lot of unearned drama and tension. That random Asian woman sacrifices herself? Nobody cares, since the movie hasn't spent any time to get to know her. Admiral Holdo sacrifices herself? Nobody cares, since nobody likes her, she made stupid decisions, and her sacrifice should be unnecessary anyway. Finn sacrifeces himself? It would mean something, but Rose stops him in quasi-sacrifice. The love confession is hardly believable and even Finn is stunned.<br/>Humour is immersion breaking and breaking the 4th wall too obnoxious.<br/><br/>Are there any redeeming qualities that movie has? Redeeming propably not, but visuals are outstanding, like they should in a modern blockbuster, camera work is great and it conveys emotions and point of views properly, music is, as always in Star Wars thanks to Williams, perfect. Unfortunatelly it doesn't help much in plot and character developement department.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Instead of the usual one or two characters making a joke every now and again, jokes are shoehorned into nearly every scene. Every character turns into a wise-cracking joke teller.

My argument is that Return of the Jedi wasn’t bold because it played everything safe. This film and Empire are the only two films in the Skywalker Saga that do not play things safe. If you’re not a drooling theorist, who literally wanted Rey to be related to everyone in the galaxy, then you’re probably like me and actually enjoyed this film. It’s not a perfect movie but it does a lot of things well. All Easter Eggs aside the film does a great job of picking up right where the last one left off. It has some beautiful scenery and the best acting in the entire saga. The cinematography is fun and pays homage to some classic films specifically on Canto Bight. The sets were gorgeous as well, Snoke’s chambers have to be the coolest looking set in a movie I’ve seen in a while. I could on and on at well the film was crafted but that’s to be expected with a multimillion dollar budget. I think the best thing about this movie are the themes that have been implemented. Without spoiling too much, Disney is saying, “Anyone can be special, in a galaxy far, far away.” Like it or not, how are they supposed to continue making these movies based on actors who are in their 60’s and 70’s?<br/><br/>I’ll admit my first go around I was very surprised where this movie went because I didn’t expect the film to go that way at all. Isn’t that why we spend $15 on a movie ticket though? Even some of the things most of the internet has a problem with... at first I was right there with the internet but after thinking about the events, in the context of the film, most of them make sense.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point, saying this movie is bad because it didn’t go the way you wanted it to go isn’t a fair assessment of anything. That’s called being entitled not being a true fan. A true fan doesn’t say the movie shouldn’t be canon because they didn’t like the installment. A true fan watches, walks out of the theater, and into the next showing to better understand the film. A true fan doesn’t say that Disney ruined Star Wars because a true fan remembers seeing the Prequel Trilogy, over and over again, from 1999 through 2005 when Star Wars newbies said the same thing.<br/><br/>This is a good film and a welcome installment to the Star Wars Franchise in my book. If for some reason you haven’t seen it yet go see it because it’s a lot of fun and it’s a good one to see in the theater. If you’ve been reluctant because you’ve heard bad things from fans remember the internet is a domino effect. Meaning that most people don’t think for themselves. They hear from someone in their newsfeed that Star Wars was bad and then they feed into it. The reason the film is sitting at 52% from fans on Rotten Tomatoes is because a fan with a following asked his followers to review bomb the movie until it was removed from the Star Wars canon. On that note I’ll leave you with this. I read an article the other day that published about a week after Empire Strikes Back came out. The article talked about how a lot of fans were disappointed or in denial to find out the Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker’s Dad.

The Star Wars we grew up with had so many systems, civilisations, ways of life and rich characters to love. The Last Jedi does not do any of this.<br/><br/>Instead, what Disney is doing with the series is replacing the world-building with endless montages of cheap climaxes. Mind you that they are fun to watch at first, but they leave you empty and bitter afterwards because they were just cheap thrills that actually destroy the world Star Wars is built upon. The Last Jedi resembles more of a cheesy soap opera than the science fiction epic that was the pre-Disney Star Wars. That is why fans absolutely hate this movie and what Disney is doing with the Star Wars franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
