Disney has killed it. I didn't think it was even possible to make Star wars Films worse then Episodes 1-3. This film makes Episodes 1-3 seem like master pieces. Lets start with the characters. They all suck and not one of them is likeable. Rey is a annoying Mary Sue, Finn who was the only likeable character in Force awakens is now a bore, Rose is annoying and the actor who plays her sucks at acting, Po is a tool, Kylo is a pathetic Villian and is more of a whiny pathetic beta cuck. Nothing about him feels threatening. When you are coming off of great Villians like Darth Vader, Darth Maul, and The Emperor. Then Poor Luke Skywalker oh dear god what have they done to you. A once great Jedi is now reduced to a pathetic whiny old man. The story is pure crap. Nothing about this Movie is fun like the older Star Wars films. Then they kill Luke with a moronic death scene. The running theme of this movie is kill off the every thing that is old and great about Star Wars and make way for the new. If this is the New Star Wars, Then just let it die now. In fact Kylo even says this.<br/><br/>Its over people. Star Wars is dead. This film was so damned bad that i cant even go back and watch Episodes 4-6 any more. Maybe in 10-15 years if i can hopefully forget every thing about this movie and the last 2 i might be able to go back and enjoy them. There is no way they can fix this in the next movie... Nothing at all. The best they might be able to do is stop making any more Star Wars movies for 5+ years and make sure who was ever involved with these abominations is never allowed near these movies and get some Talanted writers and Directors and try again from scratch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Other people enjoyed this movie, but for me, it hurt my relationship with the franchise. Luke's character progression was strange and awkward when we reach him in Episode 8. The ending also robs fans of the franchise to see Luke in action, which we were denied throughout the entirety of the film. I most likely will not be seeing Episode 9 and I'm saddened that I feel this way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is probably worse then The Phantom Menace because lots of things don't make sense. Also (SPOILERS) villain dies to fast so that was a disappointment. That same scene is dedicated to ripping off the last Jedi. There is a lack of originality and I have seen star wars better then this. This movie does have really good effects though and it is fun to see. Then again the girl Rey is a bit of a Mary sue but hey gotta make it less confusing for the kids. I give it 5 out of 10 and I hope DISNEY learned their lesson and decides to make something good. I do fear for star wars. One more bad movie and they will stick to rouge one and han solo.

You guys have obsessed over "recapturing" your childhood fantasies so much, anything short of a remake will make you go berserk, and the remakes (like episode 7) leave you feeling disappointed you were not a child again.<br/><br/>Is this movie perfect? No, that is not easy. There are a couple plot holes and campy scenes. But as a whole, it was an excellent piece of story telling. It deepened past and new characters, fleshed out the universe, built excellent tension, and was visually/audibly stunning.

Overall it felt very disconnected from the previous film.  The movie did very little to build upon The Force Awakens, and it did not feel like a sequel in a trilogy.  Whatever questions from TFA that were answered seemed very uncreative and uninspiring.  The writers failed to deliver an intriguing story.  Also, the way Luke's character was used was very underwhelming.  Luke had zero action scenes and his humor was way too flipant.  I could do without the SJW political messages, too.  Disney needs to make sure that Rian Johnson never writes or directs another Star Wars movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Worst movie of all SW movies. Piece of crap direction. Sure, cool two scenes, Luke and Yoda and the fight at Snoke throne room. The space battle does not make any sense. Heroes dying, I have no issues with it, eventually they will. The plot of sending people to the casino world is useless. Sure, he based the Force powers shown on the movie on Extended universe novels, but again, the problem is the lack of imagination, he could take several good plots from TFA and develop them, but no, he didn't care about any of it. Also, the most sad part of this movie, is that he basically gave the middle finger to "ALL" suffering, blood and tears shed from episode 3.5 to episode 6. Now, the Rebels barely have an spaceship. At least after episode 3, there was a senate and the rebels have enough time to organize and fight back. RJ ruined this trilogy, hopefully JJ will come up with something to make it interesting again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson has taken it into a new directions that are different from the Original trilogy. It's totally acceptable for Luke Skywalker to die and become one with the force after Han's death in The Force Awakens and Leia's FORCED death in the upcoming Episode IX. Yes, we loved the original trilogy so much, yes, we loved the triangle Luke-Leia-Han so much. However, they cannot be there FOREVER in the story. It's time for new blood and different characters to lead and rule in the galaxy far, far away. Therefore, the way The Last Jedi has redirected the saga is totally great and just in time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Instead... here I am.<br/>Welcome to Star Wars **** Leftist All-Minorities-Included Edition.<br/>I have read in the news that some angry Star Wars fan published an edited version of The Last Jedi without all the unnecessary feminazi, social justice warrior, vegan, diversity-at-all-costs nonsense... and all that remains are 40 minutes of nothing.<br/>I also had the same instinct to try to save the movie by editing out the nonsense. This guy saved me time and effort. Neither of them is worth the trying. We have to admit that this movie is **** beyond any repair.<br/>The leftist turn had already been slapped in our face through the red-dominated posters, which by themselves were a complete digression from the look and feel of the Star Wars franchise. The movie confirmed that it was at no point the intention of Rian Johnson to make a good Star Wars Movie. His intention was, and he may admit it publicly sooner or later, to shove in our throats tons and tons of barely concealed anti-male, female-supremacy, anti-western-civilization, pro-diversity-at-all-costs, leftist, anti-capitalist, animalist, vegan propaganda.<br/>Let me be clear about it. I am a 51 years old leftist, feminist, vegetarian, animalist man, but God this movie stinks!<br/>One may think that Rian Johnson spent 99% of his time trying to conceive a way to shove all this propaganda up our asses and only 1% of the time trying to write a decent script.<br/>The result is a movie which has been correctly described as a catastrophe, a travesty, a piece of the worst kind of agit-prop propaganda.<br/>Beyond that, on a strict cinematographic plane, it is full of plot holes, bad jokes thrown in our faces for the sake of themselves, unrealistic twists and subplots that add nothing to the story.<br/>And it does not a good service to the causes he so desperately wanted to push: the actions of the two women, admiral Hey-I-Am-Lesbian and poor-fat-ugly-stupid-self-appointed-minority-social-animal-rights-warrior Rose were so misconceived that they put at serious risk the lives of the rebels (Rose stopping Finn from destroying the cannon, thus giving the First Order the possibility to wipe off the rebels) or worse they caused thousands of deaths (admiral Holdo not telling anyone her plans and subsequently hesitating way too much before finally warp-ramming Snoke's starship).<br/>Freeing the animals (and not freeing the slave children!) only to have them most probably recaptured the day after by the rich-and-therefore-bad people of Canto Bight is not only useless. It is plainly stupid and puts in bad light the animal-rights movement.<br/>Is Rian Johnson a double agent of the worst right-wing white-male-supremacists? If so, good job Rian!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8066258"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">It's been said many times, but I still can not fathom how disappointing The Last Jedi was. My expectations for the new SW films are very low after this mess of a film.<br/><br/>I will start with what I liked; the visuals were nice and the fight scene in Snoke's throne room was pretty cool. Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and Mark Hamill (especially Driver) did a great job acting in their respective roles. Now for what I hated, where do I begin...<br/><br/>Humor is really bad and is placed during the worst moments. At one point in the film a Resistance hangar is blown up by Kylo Ren, killing everyone inside. A second later, BB-8 comedically rolls out of said hangar as if the deaths of many Resistance members was supposed to be some sort of joke. There is also a bit at the start of the film where Poe calls General Hux to crack a your mom joke to him (really?). My theater was dead silent during these types of "jokes."<br/><br/>Marry Poppins Leia. The Star Wars equivalent of jumping the shark and probably the dumbest scene in the entire franchise. Also how on earth did Poe and the others open the door Leia was trying to get through without being sucked into space?<br/><br/>The Canto Bight subplot was pointless and the animals they ride to escape were something out of Narnia.<br/><br/>Holdo not explaining her plan to Poe makes absolutely no sense. It's clear from the way other characters looked at her suspiciously that the film wanted viewers to think that she was the villain. The problem is there was no reason for her to hide the location of Crait from the other Resistance members. This means the entire subplot with Poe and Holdo is a complete waste of time. Also if lightspeeding into other ships is so powerful, why didn't they just use that against the various Star Destroyers/Death Stars in the past?<br/><br/>Tons of characters are either wasted or ruined. General Hux has been reduced to nothing more than comedic fodder. Captain Phasma gets beat down and has less screen time than in TFA. Admiral Ackbar (known for his famous "it's a trap" line in episode VI) gets killed off-screen (I am aware his actor died IRL but he still deserved better). Supreme leader Snoke - who has had so much buildup to his power/origins since TFA - gets killed off quickly and we learn nothing about him. In episode VI, Luke is convinced Darth Vader still has good in him and tries to bring him back to the light side (even with all the atrocities his father has committed). In episode VIII, Luke attempts to murder Ben Solo IN HIS SLEEP despite the latter doing nothing wrong at the time. Luke's writing in TLJ was so out of character that even Hamill himself did not like the direction his character was going.<br/><br/>Rose crashing her ship into Finn's to "protect the ones you love" makes no sense at all. For starters she would have killed Finn by plowing into him, and if Luke didn't show up then Rose just doomed the entire Resistance since the First Order was about to destroy the giant wall. Also gotta love how none of the AT-ATs fire at Finn and Rose when their ships crash and Finn is somehow able to drag Rose's body all the way across Crait. Easily the worst scene in the film after Mary Poppins Leia.<br/><br/>There are also a ton of inconsistencies. For example, Finn and Rose are about to be executed in a First Order hangar in front of Phasma and hundreds of storm troopers. When the lightspeed crash happens, Finn and Rose are the only ones alive and now Phasma is entering the hangar from a completely different location. Uh, what? I'm honestly convinced they just filmed two completely separate scenes and just mashed them together. I know this sounds like I'm nitpicking, but inconsistencies like these were so blatantly obvious even on my first (and only) viewing it left me scratching my head.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was a giant let down. Unless episode IX is on par with the OT, I am done with the series as it is now Disney's cash cow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

My disappointment is not based on any "betrayal" of what Star Wars is or is "supposed to be"; any real story teller and artist ought to be able to explore their imagination and give a new interpretation or spin on things. My disappointment is in the fact that this film is quite simply a poorly made film. It lacks almost any sense of narrative integrity- cause and effect relationships are overlooked in favor of action sequences, that while visually beautiful, have absolutely no sense of gravitas. Basic concepts such as the connection of motivation and action have no place in this film. In the end it feels like only so much fluff and dazzle. I can accept one, two or even three jumps in logic or plot holes, but this film takes it to a new level. The narrative collapses repeatedly. To find myself not caring at all about what happens to characters that I have loved since childhood only underlines the truly monumental lack of care and haphazard way this film was made. I cannot imagine a great film maker such as Spielberg or even Peter Jackson making something as poorly constructed as The Last Jedi. I am sad to say I won't be watching another film directed by Johnson. I am baffled by the critics who have praised his work- and can only think that they only hold this film to the standards that they would hold a commercial or a shoddily written Saturday morning cartoon. To me the worst Star Wars film ever made and enough to evaporate any interest in following the franchise any further. It feels like a great loss- but it's Disney's right to do whatever they want. I just don't have to follow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Esta llena de agujeros argumentales. Se llama EPISODIO 8 precisamente porque es una saga. Y esta escrita como si todo lo anterior no importara; crea sus propias reglas y solo utiliza los nombres de los personajes como pretexto para desarrollar su propia historia. Super inconsistente. Terriblemente escrita. Incluso envía mensajes politicos y la diversidad como ejes argumentales. Fuera de lugar. Absurdo.<br/>Es probable que la saga no se recupere de este absurdo intento por ganar dinero creando una expansión del universo Star Wars sin reglas, sin un eje de personajes, en donde el siguiente director pueda hacer lo que le de la gana.<br/>Star Wars se intenta vender solo como una marca, donde el contenido puede ser cualquier cosa en el espacio.

Nor did I like it very much. In my opinion, the core problem is that the film suffered from horrible writing. The overall plot was ridiculous and failed to produce any meaningful pay off at the end. The whole plot could have been avoided, if certain characters would have acted normally at certain plot points. This created unrealistic conflicts. The key characters had hardly any development during the film, while I was left with the feeling that deus ex machina was the favorite tool by the writer/director to solve conflicts. The main character, Rey, continued to be extremely badly written (but I did not have problems with Daisy's acting itself). While other two leads, Finn and Poe, were reduced to irrational characters in favor of several new characters that did not not add anything substantial to the story or to the setting. In addition, the Star Wars setting, that has been established rather comprehensively over several films, was forgotten as the writer/director needed to change the rules in order to write himself out of idiotic plot points (and still failed) or in an attempt to give the audience cheap gags. Star Wars always had humor, but it was mostly tied to the context of the scene and character interaction. While I could continue to write on and on about different problems I had with the film, suffice to say the it fails badly at three elements of good story telling - setting, characters and plot. This baffles me, as Disney seems to be able to pull off these things a lot better in their animations and even many of the Marvel films, but somehow fails so utterly when it comes Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I quite enjoyed the Last Jedi, it really reminds me of the mirror image world they are building with this new Star Wars trilogy. The thematic flow and mirroring of ESB makes this a stand out for me.<br/><br/>Spoilers below:<br/><br/>While the Casino story line may run a little long, I don't think it hurts the story and allows us to see more of the Star Wars universe.  The First Order hunting down the last of the Resistance feels tense and allows us to see Poe grow into the leader he is meant to be, through an error in judgement he realizes he is not the only one giving everything for the Resistance.  It was nice to see the old guard giving way to the new.  The building of Kylo and Rey was amazing and Luke did exactly what he needed to do to bring balance to the Force.   Who cares what Snokes back story is? It doesn't matter, he's Snoke and he made Kylo turn to the Dark Side. Also, if you ever payed the PnP Star Wars RPG back in the late 80s/early 90s, you'd know that Force Projection is a thing. Oh, and Leia was using Force Pull on the ship and rather than pulling the ship to her, she pulled herself into the ship (again non-canon now, but part of the EU). It's clear the toxic fanboys have been busy reviewing this, but this is actually quite a good movie, if a bit long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Have you ever wanted to give up or been disillusioned?  Many of us who have lived a life full with ups and downs, joys and regrets, can see ourselves in this Luke Skywalker.  How could one live up to the hype?  The victor over the Emperor, the destroyer of the Death Star -- evil was supposed to have been defeated.  What if one moment of weakness brought back everything you had worked so hard to achieve?<br/><br/>As we grow older, we can be consumed by regret; Luke Skywalker, in the end, does not succumb to apathy and withdrawal, but confronts the evil posed by his nephew in a way that befits the one who defeated the Emperor -- he truly is a Jedi, like his father before him.   He does not have a moment of violence, like Vader in Rogue One, or even Yoda in Revenge of the Sith and Attack of the Clones.  No, he stays true to the light.  Even if he was there in person, I believe the fight would have gone exactly the same way.   The defeat of the good guys leads to a new resolve, and the best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back.<br/><br/>And for everyone complaining about Leia: Yoda said, "there is another Skywalker".  She knew that Luke was alive after DS2, she heard him through the force in ESB, she resisted Vader's interrogation (which uses the force, even Luke couldn't hide the truth about Leia from Vader).  It is obvious that she's very force sensitive.<br/><br/>One of the best Star Wars ever...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie is riddled with plot holes or stupidity that detract from its overall authenticity, such as when Admiral Holdo decides to not tell Poe her plan for no apparent reason, causing him to mutiny. A 1/3 of the movie rested on this one plot point, making it seem a bit stupid. Some characters, such as Admiral Holdo, were superfluous, as she just sacrifices herself by ramming the First Order's command ship. This felt forced and unnatural, as it feels like this could have been done with an autopilot, making the movie less enjoyable. This could have also been done by a more established character, such as Admiral Ackbar, as this would have had a deeper emotional impact on the audience, as Holdo wasn't around long enough and didn't do anything to gain the audience's sympathy.<br/><br/>The movie also inserts political themes, such as animal cruelty and the arms trade, crudely, by simply stating them as wrong instead of showing their negative effects and letting the audience draw their own conclusions, such as in the Casino scene on Canto Bight. This destroys any tension that had previously been built up and breaks the pace of the movie, making it much less enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Many people were upset about the revelation that Rey's parents were scavengers. Although I personally think this sent a good message and made the Star Wars universe feel less small, the writers break the principle of Chekhov's gun, as Rey's lineage was repeatedly hinted as being significant in TFA. This makes the reveal unsatisfying for the audience. Philosophically, the way the Force was implemented was flawed. The movie stated that as one side of the Force grows stronger, the other will automatically grow with it, which is the reason given for why Rey is so powerful. This means that, ultimately, nothing any of the characters do matters, as the Force will simply empower the opposite side to balance itself out, removing any significance any individual’s actions have. This also raises the question of whether any of the characters have any real free will, as the Force is using them to be in equilibrium. This removes any weight from Rey’s or Kylo’s decisions, as it is implied that this is the Force’s will, so it is inevitable.<br/><br/>All in all, the Last Jedi could have been worse, but the story and the themes it was exploring were deeply flawed in both concept and execution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's fresh, different yet faithful to the rest of the universe. The fate of Luke if brave, but makes 100% sense. Con:<br/>I fear for the consequences of the use of Hyper-speed as a weapon, it opens a door into completely different space battles from now on.<br/>Snokes death makes no sense to me, neither from a story telling point of view or in the scene. I really hope we will see more of him in IX.<br/>While I think it is fine to include a plan that doesn't work, the Casino detour was the low point of the movie. To the haters:<br/>The film do require a bit more of it's audience than the rest of the series and made a big F-you to all film theories - which I loved it for! ;-)<br/><br/>The conclusion after 3 movies and the Rebels TV-show: Disney is not the enemy of Star Wars (at least not nearly as much as Lucas himself had become).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I thought most jokes were ill timed and detracted from the moments they were cut into.  I would have preferred the entire thing dark without the weird awkward attempts at humor. The events of the film seem completely objective in achieving a blank slate to launch other products from.  The ultimate climax of Disnefying the Star Wars franchise into its branding machine.<br/><br/>The visuals were very good, the action scenes excellent, art direction, choreography all great. Some scenes are really interesting.  This would have been an excellent movie if the writing from the start was good, but it wasn't.  The drama was forced and weirdly paced, had many plot holes, many parts this movie are disjunct from the preceding films (mediocre as it was) now completely reset by the events of this film.  So now there is a weird love-hate thing between Rey and Kylo, Finn got paired with Rose conveniently to lose the Rey love interest setup.  Seems like only yesterday Disney was wiping the Star Wars slate clean the first time, they can't even do two films without do-overs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

No, I don't care. Is it because it because I'm a Star Wars 'fanboy' and feel betrayed by the uncharacteristic actions of canonised characters? Not a jot although others seem to be. Truth is, there is just no story; nothing. It is 152 minutes of great soundtrack and pretty effects. All the subplots leave you wondering whether they are included just to showcase nostalgic elements. Unfortunately, the whole film is a mere collection of dead-end and pointless subplots. Humour and cuteness are uncomfortably forced, and relationships are unnaturally rushed. It is not even possible to provide a spoiler as it ends where it started, with no arc, either for the characters or in terms of plot. Sure, people die, but they seemed like they wanted to. About half way, I felt the same. I awarded it 2/10 as the actors performed well. Everyone else above the line was terrible; guilty of nothing more than raiding our earnings. Most worryingly, Disney also appear to have bribed most respected critics. That must have been one comprehensive press pack as this film truly is a turkey that has irredeemably ruined Christmas forever along with respect for a lot of reviewers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8061342"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">It’s amazing to see people giving Star Wars: The Last Jedi a 10 stars rating.  It’s actually quite laughable.  The Shawshank Redemption is a 10 star movie.  Good Will Hunting is a 10 star movie.  A Beautiful Mind is a 10 star movie.  There are several other films that have well-earned that coveted 10 star perfect rating, but TLJ is not one of those films.  Not by a long shot.  TLJ is nowhere near the quality of the films mentioned above.  Most people giving TLJ a high review are not even sharing their thoughts as to why they feel TLJ deserves a perfect score.  That’s disgraceful and looks suspicious.  This is how plenty of those 10 star reviews go also. “Even though I don’t consider TLJ to be a perfect film….10 stars.”  Although there are flaws in the movie….10 stars.”  Like I said before, laughable!  On the other side of the coin, there are scores of people laying down several examples and reasons why they didn’t like and/or enjoy this film.  I’m proud to be in this camp.<br/>I watched TLJ twice.  After my first viewing, I left the theater feeling unsatisfied.  After the second viewing, I left the theater feeling disgusted.  There are so many great negative reviews pointing out all the flaws in the film which, I for the most part agree with, but I wanted to touch upon how horrible the movie ended.  Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   So the film ends with a feeling of hope.  Rey has everything she needs because Yoda says so.  Rey doesn’t need any Jedi combat and force training, because she has a few ancient Jedi texts to read through.  I tried this type of training once in my life.  When I was sixteen, I bought and read through Bruce Lee’s, Tao of Jeet Kune Do, hoping to become of great fighter on my own.  I trained a little on my own like Rey did in the film.  Twenty five years later, I’m still waiting for the book reading to pay off.  This is essentially what’s being proposed in The Last Jedi.  This is absolute nonsense.   After all, Abrams did start off this Mary Sueness in Rey, so I suppose it’s only fitting that Abrams has to finish it.  My only question on this topic now is who is going to train Rey?  Answer: No one or a Luke force ghost which IMO are both terrible options.  Good luck Abrams.    The resistance has everything they need also because why…did I miss something?   Recap: Luke is dead; the resistance is down to 20 or so people, they have no capital ships or star fleet, no small star fighters or bombers, etc .  The only ship in the resistance arsenal is the Millennium Falcon.  When the resistance called for aid on Crait, no star systems came to help.  No one even responded to the distress call!!!  But hey, there’s a force sensitive slave kid at the end of the movie who’s going to take that broom and squash the First Order with it.  The movie tries to portray that even though the resistance got their butts kicked (except Rey of course) that the resistance will come back stronger than ever.  How?   The way the story was written, there is no possible way for the resistance to come back from this butt kicking.  If the solution is to write that all these star systems want to help now in IX you better give one hell of an explanation as to why they changed their minds.  As far as I’m concerned, hope is dead for the resistance and the Star Wars franchise, especially with the way Kathleen Kennedy is running things at Lucas Film.  Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy left a massive mess for Abrams to clean up in IX. The Force is human, it is not female only.   The force connects all of humanity, female, male, black, white, Christian, Muslim, Atheist, Democrat, Republican, young, old, jocks, nerds, you name it…it unifies.  Mr. George Lucas, thank you for bringing Star Wars into this world.  Your Star Wars truly unified.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

By doing this, the movie naturally gets more cliché (as some people like this), predictable (as some people don't like change that much), and illogical/plot holes etc. (more sloppy store writing as some people doesn't care if something makes sense or not).<br/>I really enjoyed Star Wars 1 to 6, but the last three movies have been absolutely horrible after Disney took over.<br/>Seeing a movie that ruins the franchise and getting great reviews is just sad.

Why didn't Snoke **** slap Fake Luke Skywalker into the sea with his mind, given that he must know where Fake Luke Skywalker is at this point, and can attack people by telepathy remotely? How come Princess Leya can survive a hard vacuum, and fly in space?  Why did the bombs fall on the dreadnought even though there was no planet to create the gravity?  Why is the Dark-side of the force represented by a dodgy mirror in a blowhole cave?  Why did Fake Luke Skywalker do such a bad job of pretending to be Real Luke Skywalker? Does Fake Luke Skywalker not know that Real Luke Skywalker is a hero and would never set out to kill Kylo Ren, his nephew? Why did Fake Luke Skywalker force hologram himself into a secret rebel mountain fortress to lightsaber duel Kylo Ren, thus avoid being killed, only to die of exhaustion? When the First Order were chasing the rebel fleet at slower than light speeds, why didn't they send 10,000 tie fighters after the rebels rather than slowly following them in their main ships? Why didn't  Leia Poppins just blast a hole out of the mountain to leave by? Why didn't they auto-pilot the rebel ships they were going to loose at light-speed into the massive enemy ships, given that they flew the last one in manually and wiped out half the FO fleet?

Why did Fasma specifically find the longest method of killing her captives possible? How come Snoke has the galaxy's largest space ship?  Why didn't the vice admiral tell anyone what her plan was, but instead appear to lead everyone to their deaths, and then act surprised when someone mutinied to try and do something.  Where were the Knights of Ren? Why have they made Rey "force God" (the dark-side of the force shows her that she is the embodiment of the Light side of the force)? Why did Luke Skywalker travel to the first Jedi Temple in order to be replaced by Fake Luke Skywalker who jokes about never having read the half a dozen books in the temple because meh? Why was Fake Luke Skywalker surprised that people turned up to elicit the help or Real Luke Skywalker, given that Real Luke Skywalker left a cryptic map to the planet with the 'rebels'?  Why are the rebels/resistance called the rebels/resistance, given that the First Order are the remnants of the Empire; surely the rebels are just the Navy/Army of the legitimate government?  If not then what are the actual legitimate governments doing about the first Order?  How come the Force ghost of Yoda has the power of Thor for no reason, and uses it to destroy the first Jedi Temple?<br/><br/>In no particular order those were some of the many questions the film left me with.  Visually nice, good special effects, a couple of half decent fight scenes, OK music.  Worthless plot, stupid characters. Luke Skywalker was a completely different character, Leia has sporadic super powers, Snoke gets cut in half comically, and Admiral Aqbar died.  Oh and all of the white men are 'toxic masculine' figures who are bumbling idiots who need to shut the **** up and get out of the way and let Women (who are superior) do the job.  Don't bother with Disney Star wars any more, its a trap for the nostalgic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But sadly, the price for seeing them is too high. There is no consistency in the characters, the arcs or the setting. Things happen without reason. There is no payoff to anything that was promised by the first movie in the new trilogy and to my discontent, there is no narrative coherence. Also but not the worst: cringy, childish/cartoonish and partially obstrusive humor, strange choices made by the characters, hollow performances, weird romance and a pointless 30 minute detour? Why can Rei use all the jedi tricks without proper training? Purple Lady had a very late realization. Casino planet? A lot of wasted potential. I'm flabbergasted. Switching directors mid-trilogy seems to be a poor choice in hindsight. I think I just should stop caring, it's not worth it anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not going to waste time on how many ways this movie is a colossal failure as the countless meaningful reviews here already spell it all out.  Its pathetic how the paid critics lined up in praise.

The Return of Luke Skywalker was like a cinematic Holy Grail for Star Wars fans and I can't think of how they could of f****ed it up more than they have. Star Wars is dead I refuse to include these Disney Star Wars movies as Canon. Will not be seeing episode 9 and will warn everyone I know not to see this move or 9. No I'm not a Bot or some Butt hurt fan or sexist that Disney and the media would have you believe. Look at the difference between the Audience and Critics score here and on rotten tomatoes (RT being 91% critics and 49% audience) Disney has gotten so big and so powerful that I truly believe Critics are paid off or just scared to give their honest opinion of the movie in fear of being blacklisted.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi is truly a masterpiece and by far my favorite Star Wars movie. The Last Jedi is definitely the darkest of all Star Wars films, but it contains 3 great new characters and the perfect amount of comedic relief to keep the audience happy throughout the film. Seriously, it is undoubtedly the funniest Star Wars ever. Don't think the movie is all jokes though. Rian Johnson delivered a film with a ton of action and scenes emotional enough to leave some fans in tears. The Last Jedi is the only Star Wars film I have ever almost cried during. Not only that, but the film gives the audience some of the most jaw-dropping moments ever to be seen in a Star Wars film. Luke Skywalker was right: "This is not going to go the way you think." Overall, Star Wars The Last Jedi is a grand slam. Rian Johnson has delivered a Star Wars film that is incomparable to any other movie in the series. He took a big risk with this film, but it was risk I am happy he took. I have already seen The Last Jedi twice and can't wait to see it again: it's that good!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Tons of action<br/>- Epic plot twists / shocking moments<br/>- Clearly not a copy of The Empire Strikes Back<br/>- Nostalgia<br/>- Very emotional scenes<br/>- Great new characters<br/>Cons (if I had to pick one):<br/>- A couple very small, unimportant plot holes<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/>Sound/Visuals - 5/5<br/>Plot/Characters - 5/5<br/>Structure - 5/5<br/>Acting - 5/5<br/>Overall - 100%</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Last Jedi is just not a good movie, if this were any other franchise we would all be laughing about it in a MST3K/Rifftrax sort of way; because Star Wars means so much to people there is "polarization". This movie isn't bad because I didn't get what I wanted as a fan of the series, this movie is bad because I didn't get what I wanted as a fan of movies in general. Lame jokes, unlikeable characters, a boring plot that goes nowhere and some of the worst editing and pacing I've seen this side of the Transformers franchise. In six months when this trash is on home media all of its supporters are going to have a hard time defending it. The only good thing about this movie is the commitment by every actor to try and make it work. Star Wars movies are supposed to leave you with the want to come back to the galaxy far, far away and I honestly don't care after this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I've been such a Star Wars fan for such a long time, and this movie, is the first time I've really disliked the whole movie (I mean, nobody liked Jar Jar, but he didn't ruin the whole movie).<br/><br/>So when Disney decided to un-cannonize the expanded universe, that was hard enough, after all, it was the incredible popularity of those books and comics that brought Star Wars back into popularity enough to spawn off new trilogies and spin offs.  But we could deal, it wasn't that bad, the new cannon would borrow some of the best story-lines and characters and make a whole new and interesting followup to finally finish off the stories.<br/><br/>This movie kind of feels like a slap in the face to all big fans of the Franchise.  It decides to either not answer, or flippantly answer many of the big questions we had coming out of the last movie (who is Snoke? Who were Rey's parents?).  The entire Finn/codebreaker story is superfluous to the movie.  They've gotten rid of the classic "bombers" from the past and introduced some kind of slow moving gravity style bombers instead of missile style torpedoes (in space??).  Just awful.  Instead of homages to the popular ideas coming from the expanded universe, it stomps over everything we've come to love, the new ideas are bad, their execution poor.<br/><br/>The pluses are what you might expect.  The movies does have a nice big budget for effects, and nice balanced cast, and mostly good acting (I didn't like the role they wrote for Luke, but that isn't his fault).  So it does have some epic fights, great music, and big scenes.  These things are hard to enjoy; however, because there are so many huuuuuge plot holes in the movie, and it draaaags on for an incredibly long time.  At the end of the movie, the most disappointing thing for me is the overall arc they've taken the universe in.  We went from new republic, to dictatorship with the empire, then rebellion.  But then after return of the Jedi, I Han and Leia split up, Han lost the falcon, Luke went into seclusion, and the rebellion got crushed?  We've now lost so many of our beloved characters, even the death of Akbar was just brushed past in seconds.  By the end of this movie the rebellion is down to a dozen people running away in the rediscovered but damaged millennium falcon?  The final ground fight was going to be the "seed of a new rebellion"?  Why would anyone be inspired to join a rebellion anew, the last one was apparently ruthlessly crushed, to the point of irrelevance.  I'll go see the last movie, but these films no longer feel like an ever enriching, consistent expanding universe and storyline, but rather they just do a deus ex machina whenever they want to take a hard left turn or right turn for the plot, and take stories in random new directions.  I have more hope for the spinoffs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is where the divide is created between the two audiences and why the disparity of reviews exists.<br/><br/>Judging the film as a product, purely to entertain and turn a profit for the studio; The Last Jedi couldn't have done a better job (it is Disney after all). However, as a Star Wars film that continues it's now epic saga; it falls rather flat on its face.<br/><br/>AS A STAND ALONE FILM: 7/10<br/><br/>The Last Jedi presents a serviceable plot with interesting and memorable characters, be it for their personalities, striking designs or otherwise memorable quips and development throughout the film. The cinematography is stunning at times and can command your attention effortlessly; which should not come as a surprise from a huge budget production. The cast also delivers some fantastic performances, such as Adam Drivers role of Kylo Ren and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker to name a couple.<br/><br/>The writing however, feels conflicted at times, with the film struggling to be decisive about what genre it wants to be; with some displays of awkward comedy, as if to appeal to an audience with little attention spans. It's cheesy, feeling like a parody or comedy sketch at times that overstays it's welcome. That aside, the plot is coherent but isn't afraid to deviate to challenge the audience and defy predictions; it keeps things rolling and builds tension. The characters for the most part, felt genuine and had clear priorities and goals, all done without lengthy exposition that interrupts the main plot; although it is worth noting that the sub-plot to this film is an inverse of that statement, ultimately being shallow and a clear case of raising social awareness with barely any subtlety involved; leaving the impression that the audience is unable to decipher hidden meanings and nods to real world conflicts/issues.<br/><br/>Overall, The Last Jedi is a solid film that can entertain and appeal to a wide audience; with stunning visuals and great performances held together by a captivating narrative.<br/><br/>AS A STAR WARS FILM 3/10<br/><br/>If you want to know my credibility, I grew up on the original movies and have seen the prequels as well as the animated "Clones Wars" TV show and was an avid player of Star Wars Battlefront (the PS2 versions (the good ones)) I'm not a rabid fan, but I respect the series and enjoy what it offers. This film, however, is easily the worst and I don't think many should be surprised, even compared to Episode VII and Rouge One.<br/><br/>It's a mess of in your face politics, pretty lights and colors and of course; marketable cute background props. Episode VII wanted to reinvent classic Star Wars for the modern era, whereas Episode VIII wants to sweep it all under the rug. "Let the past die, kill it if you have to" -Kylo Ren, TLJ Trailer. It's an obvious middle finger to the fans of the franchise and from an artistic point of view, it's murder suicide. The political side, ruins the film and has no place in a "science FICTION" production; and I've heard the "feminist propaganda" label being thrown at this movie, but in all honesty I liked Rae. Seeing women as leads in huge productions is a nice change; just very disappointing that they are done with so low effort and can be forced to meet a diversity quota. Again, REAL world politics has no place in a FICTIONAL world people look to, to escape reality. The plot makes little sense when previous installments are factored in. (Minor spoilers ahead) The First Order from Episode VII are here, but for some reason are stronger and more powerful, which makes no sense; as the empire were fractured after Episode VI and then the first order rose from the ashes and got king hit in Episode VII but yet STILL out number and out gun the "resistance" by Episode VIII. At this rate, the First Order/Empire may as well be that kid on the playground that always had a trump card for everything during imaginary play time.<br/><br/>Then there's Luke Skywalker who has transitioned between films (off screen mind you) into the very opposite of his original character; Rae may as well have not even trained to be a Jedi since she's essentially a Jedi master after a couple of on screen minutes of training and Leia, well, you'll just have to see the movie. Meanwhile the rest of the cast are ultimately throwaways bar Kylo Ren who is more or less the same as he was in Episode VIII.<br/><br/>As a Star Wars film, it feels like a compilation of Saturday Night Live sketches and fan fiction that tries so hard to go against the norm to be original but forgets that "new" does not always equal "good".<br/><br/>Overall, disappointing and a deterant to see any future Star Wars films</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8056479"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">First of all, The Last Jedi has not only been the most divisive star wars film for me, but probably the most divisive ive ever seen. Ive seen it a total of five times and finally have a decent grasp of a conclusion. Fisrt of all, I think in total the good does outweigh the bad, but lets start with that first. The worst thing about this film is the story, a pretty big aspect of film. Half of the story is very strong, with Rey and Lukes story on the island and Kylo Rens story proving to be investing and delightful, however the canto bight subplot and the long chase between the resistance and the first order is a huge detriment. Lets start with Canto Bight. This is by far the worst aspect of this film. The whole sequence is so poorly executed, with our main characters Finn and Rose having zero chemistry together, and a waste of John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran's acting talent. The whole scene serves no purpose, as in the end the entire mission amounts to nothing, and it tries to deliberately beat you over the head with political messages. Also, it feels way too much like earth and something out of a completely different film and not part of the star wars universe, and not to mention completely tanks the pacing of the whole second act whenever it cuts back to it. The one good thing to come out of it is that it expands on the lore of the first order and how they shelled planets for testing, but that could of been explained anywhere. In terms of the resistance and first order chase, it eats up the runtime and just goes on for too long, when time could have been devoted to more important things. Onto the next issue, the new characters are garbage. Rose as a character feels forcedly hamfisted into the film, has a lack of backstory and in general does not need to be there. Admiral Holdo again serves no real purpose in the film as to set up a false sense of a traitor, and the worst character of all is DJ, played by Benicio del Toro, who is completely wasted in a stupid character again served to beat us over the head with messages. Onto the next negative, the pacing and the tone. The second act of this film drags... hard. The slow chase scenes and canto bight scenes grind the pacing to a halt, but tonal issues is a big problem, mainly regarding the humour. The majority of the humour in this film just does not work, comes across as so forced, and take you completely out of more serious moments. When Luke is handed the saber by Rey, weve waited two years to see his reaction, and instead it is played for a cheap gag just like most of the film does, and this further bridges the gap between comedy and drama, giving the film an unclear sense of what it wants to be and as a result has serious tonal issues. The last negative I feel is the lack of expansion to the lore set up in The Force Awakens, and when I say a lack of I meant a complete disregard for. The majority of setups introduced in the force awakens were completely scrapped. Snoke having no backstory before being killed, lack of knowledge on the knights of ren, how did R2 suddenly turn on, how did Maz come to possession of Luke's saber, how did Lor San Tekka obtain a piece of the map to Luke. These can be interpreted as plot holes but perhaps the biggest one of all is why Luke built a map to his location in TFA when he said in TLJ that he came to the island to die, which does not make sense. Lastly, there are many many story beats I feel have been copied from TESB and ROTJ. Rey sensing conflict in Kylo-Luke sensing conflict in Vader. Kylo bringing Rey to Snoke-Vader bringing Luke to the Emperor. Snoke showing Rey the fleet being destroyed-The Emperor showing Luke the fleet being destroyed. Rey finding a dark place on the island-Luke finding a dark place on Dagobah. Rey seeing herself in the dark place-Luke seeing himself in the cave in Vader's mask. I could give more but so many story beats are similar. Onto the positives now, the film feels like a breath of fresh air for the franchise in the way that it is constantly surprising and tears down your expecations for the franchise, and its impossible to be blown away by some sequences. The action and the way it is directed is absolutely beautiful, with the opening space battle, Rey and Kylo teaming up against the Praetorian Guards (one of the best scenes in the entire saga) Holdos lightspeed sacrifice and the final battle on Crait being particularly powerful sequences. The cast is universally brilliant-Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver giving magnetic performances. The existing characters are brilliant. Kylo Ren being a more complex character than ever, Rey's parent reveal being perfect as it shows her forging a path from a nobody to a powerful force user, and Luke being just as investing and humanised as ever. The score is also terrific, and in conclusion the directing in TLJ is beautiful, the action is roaring and the existing characters are expanded upon and more investing, but many drawbacks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke and Rey's story takes a hard turn against expectation and Finn's subplot is magical and somewhat philosophical, but fails to serve any importance to the end of the film.

Firstly, I was bored.

I took off an extra point for that.

I did not like the cookie cutter story line.  1. It was so perfectly cut that one could cleanly remove a part of the movie and it wouldn't impact the movie in any way.<br/><br/>2. Too easy to figure out the outcome of the story.<br/><br/>3. The animals in this movie have absolutely nothing on the Ewoks or even R2D2 for that matter.<br/><br/>4. The movie does an overall horrible job at showing enough variety of the Star Wars Universe.<br/><br/>5. The movie acts like it's 5 years after the Force Awakens but it's clearly literally a day after The Force Awakens.  It leaves the audience absolutely zero sense of awareness of what time it is in this story line. They're just making this stuff as they go it seems...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally #6. The training of Rey is 100% Unbelievable, she reaches the level of Jedi Knight with absolutely no effort compared to "all" of the previous movies.<br/><br/>Makes no sense at all in this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Do you know what it's funny? Some desperate Disney stans saying things like that: "Don't listen to the bad reviews or the negative people, the movie is great", "Ignore the haters, go to see the movie". Haters??? So you dare to call "haters" the immense majority of the SW FANS who don't recognize Rian Johson's crap as a Star Wars movie? So are they lying about the ridiculous things that they saw in this movie? So Leia doesn't fly? Luke doesn't refuse to train Rey? He doesn't not throw away his light saber? He doesn't milk a "space cow"? He doesn't die without actually fighting? Yoda's ghost doesn't burn the Jedi books? Rey is not a nobody with magic powers (Marie Sue) she got without trainning? Snoke doesn't die without a explaination about his past or who he is? Snoke... What a silly name for a villain that was supposed to be the most dangerous Sith of this new trilogy! It sounds more like a perfect name for a pet. Yes! I can imagine a dog or a cat called Snoke. I bet there are pets with this name, and there were BEFORE the character was created! Come on, Snoke, don't pee on the carpet. Snoke, come here to drink your milk. It's NOT a good name for a villian. And for what I know in Star Wars, the big villains are Sith and have a "Darth" before their Sith names!<br/>Well, all I have to say is NO! I won't to see this movie, I won't pay to see this, I won't give any money to Disney anymore! The fans are not lying! This movie sucks.<br/>Disney look a little desperate, paying critics for good reviews and making some people (Mark Hamill, Angry Joe) apologize for being honest about how bad the movie really is!<br/>And they want us to buy books and stuff to read their absurd explanations for some things that the movies could not show??? Only money matters to Disney!<br/>I prefer "midiclorians" a thousand times than "The force is female" (and I am a feminist woman)! Kathleen Kennedy, I have to say something to you: The Force is NOT female or male.It has NO sex or gender! Stop being so ridiculous!<br/>So you think you can create new rules or powers for the Force users without any complainning from the fans of this series? You are very stupid for thinking so. It's the same as someone deciding to make a Superman movie in wich he can become invisivle, wears yellow suit, can hold a big piece of kryptonite without getting weak and doesn't fly anymore! Fans will say "This is not Superman, it's someone else". That's what's happen with Star Wars as most fans are saying: "This is not Luke, this is not the Force, this is not Yoda, this is not Leia and this is not STAR WARS!" If Disney couldn't not see that it was going to happen, so they are really stupid! To me  Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy, JJ Abrams and Disney are all big morons. Thank you for killing my beloved franchise! And I am NOT an old generations fan!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It opens with a Simpsons phone crank and goes down hill from there.<br/>This movie is filled with gaping plot holes, characters either doing dumb things or performing  contrary to their established natures, hates white men, and takes a flame thrower to all previous SW movies. If you take 10 seconds to actually think about what's going on, your head will explode.<br/>Numerous nonsensical items have already been listed on this forum, but I would like to offer one more because I haven't seen it mentioned yet. It's not a "huge" thing - just indicative of this illogical farce. Apparently, Chewbacca has no problem risking his life to chauffeur his new boss Rey (yes, she actually orders him around) to the enemy's flagship so she can "save" Kylo - the same kid who just murdered his best friend a few days prior. Can you imagine the Chewie of IV-VI (or any other sentient being) going along with this BS? WTF?<br/>I'm angry the creators and "professional" critics duped me into wasting my time and money on this garbage. But what really irks me is how Disney abuses its media muscle to attack those who dump on their 100+ million crap fest. I guess that's how the Alt Left operates these days. Anybody who disagrees with them is a racist, misogynist, or some other subhuman basement dwelling hater.<br/>Fine.<br/>Not one penny more will I spend on anything related to this franchise.

I was mesmerized in the planet of tattooine, the beginning of luke skywalkers journey into what would become an iconic pop culture saga. I fell in love with the daring beauty of princess leia and the raw intimidating power of darth vader. I fell in love with the admittedly cool storm trooper army and giant death star weapon. I fell in love with the world and the philosophy behind the force and how the audience can relate to it. (And i really liked Jawas for some reason.They look kinda cool don't they?) Look, I rarely go to the theatre, but this movie was an exception. I went into this film completely blind and avoided any trailers or reviews in anticipation... and i was left with shock, awe and disappointment. The film tries so hard to zig-zag the audiences expectations it betrays it's own story and the loyalty of thousands of fans worldwide. The majority of the new characters are unnecessary and disposable and all of the important plot points with the exception of just a few, fall horridly flat. Did i mention politics? Yeah, par for the course of this generation we need to get the leftist/progressive propoganda shoved down our throats where nobody asked for it. (A grandma protoge of Princess Leia sporting bright purple hair that completely stands out of place? Check.) Star Wars has never been about promoting anyone's political agenda, but about telling a fantastic story. This abominable film breaks that rule. Unlike it's predecessor, this film had me leaving the cinema in a state of confusion and ultimately, anger. Shame you on Kathleen Kennedy and your immature and unprofessional feminist writing group, and shame on you forever Disney for tarnishing the reputation of a legendary story passed down from generation to generation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But ignoring the meta-critique, the movie itself was extremely clunky and tedious. The Finn/codebreaker storyline went nowhere. On the one hand, the daring, against-all-odds mission is supposed to work - it’s Star Wars!. On the other, even if you want it to fail and teach Po a lesson (always obey your superiors even when they seem to be leading your entire movement to certain death - a sickening betrayal of the whole ‘rebel’ ethos), they should have killed off Finn. There are so many things I could criticize about this movie, but I’ll just do one more. Why exactly are we supposed to care about the Resistance? No one responded to their distress call - clearly the rest of the galaxy doesn’t thing the First Order is all that bad if they’re unwilling to fight against them. Okay, one more thing, sorry. Why did the movie end with broom kid? I don’t care about broom kid, no one cares about broom kid. Every other movie ends with main characters - a concrete summation of coming conflict or a recent victory - this one ends with an abstract appeal to a notion of hope. Broom kid probably doesn’t even care or know about the First Order, he just wants to be freed. Just another tiny instance of this film’s message of subversion. Everything about the movie seems to betray some aspect of ‘Star Wars’. This is how a culture dies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Keck. I would like to include a special thank you to both directors - and perhaps Disney - for allowing our once beloved hero, NOW warped cynical deranged defeatist coward, to greet Rey in TFA in FULL "Sunday Best" JEDI ROBES – before pitching his Father’s light saber over a cliff in pure slapstick fashion, choke on milk from a quadriplegic sea sloth and  repeatedly retreat to his hut in fear in TLJ.

The Last Jedi checks off each and every fantasy of a fan, whether it be complex concept, dreadful characters, awe-struck moments or one of the finest unpredictability natured script of Star Wars. The sense of urgency that was present in The Force Awakens is still kept alive with a tightly packed screenplay especially in the last hour of the movie (which is the ace in the hole and also reminds you of Inception) where the movie holds you on the edge of the seat proving you wrong about every prediction you might have created in your mind (Literally Luke Skywalker's dialogue comes alive, "This is not going to go the way you think!"). A marvelous background music by John Williams, stunning visuals and Adam Driver's presence on the screen are some of the bright colors that paints this stunning craft that Star Wars is. This is Rian Johnson, Star Wars and a cinema at its peak, without any doubt this is the best installment of Star Wars Series till date.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8030988"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This movie is a HUGE disappointment for me.  A bad Star Wars movie is still an entertaining movie, but this is by far the worst Star Wars movie ever made.  There are so many reasons this movie sucks.  -Superfluous characters and subplots (who doesn't love Laura Dern and Benico del Toro but their characters had no reason to be in this movie, Fin/Rose mission to casino to find "Master Codebreaker" absurd).  -Idiotic plot holes (hello, you can't drop gravity bombs in space, what they are electromagnetic?, then you don't need to get "over" your target, who is going to fly those suicide bombers anyway?)(fly a ship through the big New Order vessel?, try leading with that)(a whole long chase scene? Han Solo can take the Falcon out of hyperspace in the short distance of a moon's atmosphere, just hyperspace in front of them, duh!), etc.etc. -Throwing away stuff that has been built up (who is Snoke and how did he come to power?, who cares?, he's dead already!)(Knights of Ren?, never heard of them)<br/><br/>-Pitiful, not menacing villains.  -Squandered opportunities (fight between Fin and Captain Phasma is like 2 seconds, WTF?)(almost no light saber duels).  -Ridiculous retconning (you don't need to train for years to be a Jedi, Rey is a force expert with no training at all)(Yoda can just come along and shoot force lightning?, where was he when Palpatine was trying to kill Luke Skywalker?)(did I mention flying a ship through another vessel? makes it a lot easier to blow up a Death Star). -Forced political rhetoric (we get it, horse racing bad, capitalism bad, so I get my money back, right?). -Contrived, cringe-worthy "romance" (I love you and will sacrifice my life for you even though we just met).<br/><br/>-Cannon and characters completely inconsistent with previous movies, including the movie to which this is supposedly a sequel.  But the biggest travesty is how they treated Luke Skywalker's character.  He was totally wasted and betrayed.  Also, how pitiful the resistance is; they have accomplished nothing since the first Trilogy and are worse off than ever before. The more I think about it, the angrier I get.  Then to top it off, they harp on this theme of letting go of the past.  Yeah, the past when Star Wars movies where great.  This movie is garbage.<br/><br/>AMENDMENT - STRIKE THE LAST JEDI FROM STAR WARS CANNON! - I know some of you will dismiss this as pathetic, obsessive, sad, fan-boy wallowing because I didn't get the movie I wanted, but the more I think about it, the more I think I'm right. As I have reflected on the film, my opinion hasn't changed, it has gotten stronger. Every day I scan the new user reviews on metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes and watch the negative reviews pile up, and their beef is the same as mine.  I know there are people who liked this movie. My son liked it, but he is young and didn't grow up watching Star Wars, and he loves Kylo Ren. I've reviewed a bunch of positive user reviews (the critic reviews are utter BS, so I don't concern myself with those). They fall into a few camps: people who didn't grow up watching Star Wars (thus reasonably impressed with a $200M blockbuster), people familiar with Star Wars who don't like it or are board of it, people who grew up with Star Wars but are not fans, apologists (people who love Star Wars and are trying to find a silver lining) and idiots (people who grew up with and liking Star Wars that also like this movie). Most non-apologist reviews usually say something along the lines of "this movie broke the mold and went in different directions". Here's the thing… if you want something new, go make something new. I'm not saying make it stale, but there is Star Wars cannon and a Star Wars formula that make Star Wars great (and it includes dog-fights, light sabers, the Force, master/apprentice relationships, light side vs. dark side, awesome villans, and courageous, noble heroes and Jedi Knights; if you don't like it, feel free to enjoy another franchise). This movie is a) garbage by any measure, b) a TERRIBLE Star Wars movie and totally inconstant with canon including the movie to which it is supposed to be a sequel, c) a total FU to Star Wars fans, and d) gives one of the most iconic heroes in cinematic history the worst send-off imaginable. So, I am praying for a miracle. I think everyone who thinks this Star Wars movie sucks, and that we (and Luke) deserve better, boycott Disney products (and I love Disney, so this is extreme for me) until they agree to remake or completely retcon Episode VIII. Also, that director RJ, and all the execs that approved this terrible movie, should never be allowed anywhere near the Star Wars franchise - There, fan-boy rant concluded.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Here are some Reasons why<br/><br/>1. Bombs drop in space?<br/>2. Mary Poppins Leia<br/>3. Leia at beginning of the film is disappointed with Poe because he got twelve ships killed while taking out a dreadnaught, a ship that has hundreds of other ships and can decimate bases. Leia doesn't think 12 ships is worth that...<br/>4. Finn and Rose's storyline is useless and a waste of my life i will never get back<br/>5. Admiral Holdo (purple hair) starts conflict off with Poe when all he wants to know is WTF are they gonna do<br/>6. Leia Tells Poe what the plan is when he awakes on the escape pods and he is like "oh, yeah that make perfect sense." Why didn't Holdo just tell him the **** plan<br/>7. Luke only gives Two lessons<br/>8. Snokes monologue about how he can see into Kylo's mind the perceives to get stab by a light saber that Kylo is controlling next to him...HOW THE ABSOLUTE **** DID YOU NOT SEE THAT?<br/>9. Luke's death should've have been Kylo striking down Luke but before he does Luke saying the same phrase as Obi-Wan Kenobi when he was stuck down by Vader<br/>10. The fight with Finn and Phasma is a joke, Phasma is supposed to be this Badass next Boba Fett type for the series but has gotten her ass handed to her twice by Finn a Trooper who used to mop floors...<br/>11. The Title of the movie and what Luke was trying to teach Rey is that all things have the force and the Jedi should stop using it as their own, therefore the Jedi should die, and nothing is good or evil everything is both, but at the end of the movie we still have both Jedi and Sith, NOTHING HAS CHANGED. The movie literally contradicts its own title</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
