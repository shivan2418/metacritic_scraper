The only thing that could save this franchise now is for Sheev to come back and lay waste to the entire galaxy with force lightening, put this fanatical sick disney mouse to rest, and let the midichlorians of the galaxy create life anew (apparently this is now possible as Yoda demonstrates in this abomination of film by setting fire to things). That or perhaps let Marcia Lucas edit another Star Wars film, but even then she could probably not do much with the content being created under Kathleen Kennedy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I recognize that Rian Johnson had a difficult task, and lots of people were expecting TLJ to meet the standard set by ESB. I was not. However, I was also not looking for a movie that rehashed every plot point in ESB and ROTJ (to the point of parroting back dialogue), without even developing the new heroes we had come to love from TFA. As a female fan, I was excited to see the vulnerable, nuanced character of Rey in TFA, and spent the last two years defending her from "she's just a Mary Sue" detractors. Well, bad news, in this movie she actually is a Mary Sue. (Speaking of Mary Sues, when did Finn learn how to fly? A major plot point in TFA revolves around the fact that he can't, and now he can just hop in a cockpit and all's well?)<br/><br/>At its heart, TLJ doesn't want to be a Star Wars movie, but it fails to take us in a new direction, or any direction. The plot and characters are stuck in place (literally). Prolific jump cuts make it impossible to build any tension and effectively diffuse what little there is. John Williams' score is actually tiring and tonally out of place with what is on screen. The short shots allow no time to develop musical themes, so we're basically reduced to "Is Rey on-screen? Rey's theme is playing." "Is Luke on-screen? Force theme." "The Resistance? March of The Resistance 1000x!!" The soundtrack is like dessert all the time, and leaves you feeling sick.<br/><br/>My dislike of TLJ does not stem from being a butt-hurt fan with wish fulfillment issues. The few things lauded as gutsy in TLJ were actually telegraphed in TFA and I was on board with them. A particular aspect of Luke's past did not sit well with a number of people, but I was pleasantly surprised and felt that it worked. I won't say that TLJ was good just because it touched on a couple of interesting things that were teed up for it. This movie has almost none of the threads from TFA, none of the heart of ESB or ANH, and none of the mythos that underscores the whole franchise. It's just a poorly edited, hollow exercise in irreverent predictability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I was always a really big star wars fan, I first watched the original trilogy and then the prequels. I can understand some of the hate for the prequels, but these movies go so far beyond that. It was hard for me to realize that this wasn't some fan fiction written by a teenager, but was the product of millions upon millions of dollars. This movie had more plot holes than I can count. The political innuendos are all over the place (We get it you like women being in power). Why did the admiral of the rebel fleet have perfect hair, which was dyed purple, and was wearing a **** party gown? How can I take her seriously... Tons of cheap jokes thrown in randomly so no "serious" seen can be taken seriously. Remember all those theories about Snoke and how mysterious he was? Well apparently he's just a dumbass who got killed like an overly-talkative bond villain. Rey is still Miss Perfect and she even kinda kick's Luke's ass. Luke isn't a powerful jedi master in this movie, he's a depressed old man who failed at life. Coming into this you think you're gonna at least see him do something interesting considering he's supposed to be a legendary Jedi, but instead is incredibly underwhelming.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this pile but I would probably just be reiterating what others have said. I actually believe this movie deserves a score of 0.<br/><br/>TDLR; movie was stupid, didn't feel like star wars</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Everything is not always happiness and triumph. All things considered, it is a very good movie and well worth seeing.

Daisey Ridley, and, especially, Adam Driver, are fantastic.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/>-The Kylo/Rey payoff; it felt lazy. The whole movie builds towards letting go of the past, and almost hints at a point where the jedi, sith, rebels, and empire are forgotten, and something new, that comes in the grey area, arises. But nope. Wasted opportunity<br/>-Idiocy; The leaders of both sides, and Poe and Amdiral Holdo are particularly idiotic, to the point of breaking suspension of disbelief.<br/>-Rey and BB-8 are still far too Mary Sue like, particularly BB-8 in this one.<br/>-New characters we don't get invested in; Rose and Admiral Holdo felt forced, introduced too fast to develop character attachments.<br/>-The timeline; it makes no goddamn sense; and who the **** is funding the first order. The empire, I get it, they usurped the galactic republic, with its massive population and giant economy. But the republic was back, so who the hell is giving this imperial offshoot the money to build supermassive capital ships and star system killing death star bases the size of planets?<br/>-Disjointed; no real payoff, feels like one long chase seen<br/>-Good thing Rose, a random republic mechanic, could deduce the method and countermeasure to a never before seen imperial system of hyperspace tracking<br/>-Plot holes: big enough to drive a super star destroyer through.<br/>-Wasting characters like captain Phasma...again.<br/><br/>THE UGLY:<br/>-Luke; as Mark Hamill himself has stated, this character got a terrible treatment in this movie, and that breaks from everything Luke had been built up to be.<br/>-Incongruity; While The Force Awakens was clearly designed to let anyone continue the Star Wars story afterwards, one would think at least a FEW of the important questions would be answered, other than potentially who Rey's parents were. Its very, very obvious that the same person who made TLJ did not make TFA<br/>-The entire Finn/Rose subplot and Casino world seen could be cut with no drop off in quality of the film. It was simply a place to try and make a clumsy (and alltogether nonsensical) political statement.<br/>-Misleading; The exploration of Jedi mythos and morality was just about absent, reduced to two scenes. Given the trailers, this feels like a massive deception<br/>-leias Mary Poppins moment<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/>-It wasn't terrible, but it was also far from good. Easily the weakest of any Star Wars flick not containing Jar Jar Binks or Hayden Chistensen. Over-complicated, it loses its way, and pays off little to none of the series new topics and questions raised by TFA.<br/><br/>I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad Michael Bay is back to direct Episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And believe me, it needs to be utterly abysmal in order to earn such a rating without a shred of hyperbole.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, The Last Jedi revels in the sexism and racism it manufactures and proudly politicizes it as a "progressive" utopia, using the Star Wars franchise as an awkward vehicle to push this not-at-all-subtle social justice agenda.<br/><br/>Imagine a beloved franchise being violently stabbed and bludgeoned to death, and then being spat on and laughed at by cultural vandals who care more about their utopian societal ideals than they do about any of your cherished memories. That's what this movie is. It somewhat reminded me of footage of those Taliban members going into the ancient Buddhist temples, toppling all the age-old statues and destroying historical relics because they can't tolerate anything that brings others peace that doesn't align with their own authoritarian ideological bent.<br/><br/>Ironically, the cultural pendulum is starting to quickly swing away hard from third-wave feminism and the extreme SJW politics presented in The Last Jedi, which will leave it looking very awkward and out-of-place in 40 years' time, as its forced "politics du jour" will be representative of a long-gone era. (Unlike A New Hope, which wasn't crammed full of contemporary political issues of the late 70's and thus can still be enjoyed today without that jarring awkwardness of breaking the 4th wall).<br/><br/>It's clear that Disney, Rian Johnson, and Kathleen Kennedy are trying to reboot Star Wars from the ground up, with the intention of introducing Generation-Z to these new matriarchic and gynocentric narratives as the norm. Having the kids of today growing up with them, as it were. They believe that using a wildly popular franchise like Star Wars as a carrier for delivering this propaganda will indoctrinate kids at a young age, while simultaneously burning down all the old "sexist" and "bigoted" films that came before it is an act of heroism. The message being pedaled is toxic progressiveness. However, this is failing for them in a big way. Just like it failed when others tried to ram social justice narratives into other much-loved franchises such as Baldur's Gate and Mass Effect. You think they'd learn that the vast majority of people do not want this crap in their entertainment and will retaliate against it with all their might, just as they're doing now by down-voting this turd of a film and speaking out about everything it did wrong.<br/><br/>I, for one, am no longer interested in paying Disney one red cent to see Episode 9: Return of the Matriarchy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not just the movie, the reactions as well. Are journalists being paid to defend it vehemently, criticizing anyone who dares speak out against the bland, boring plot or forced characters? I don't even know where to begin in expressing my dislike of this film.<br/><br/>I found The Force Awakens underwhelming. And the prequels were never fan favorites. But The Last Jedi was so frustratingly terrible, all four of those films look pretty damn good in retrospect. I'll cliff some of the ridiculous aspects of this movie.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>- Rather than giving Poe character development, he was used as some ham-fisted caricature of "toxic masculinity" as the buzzword regurgitating misandrist psychos like to say.<br/><br/>- General Tumblr with the purple hair had to be the most useless character in the entire franchise. Worse than Jar Jar, worse than Rose. She was just there to patronize Poe a half dozen times. Then she gets this big heroic death? That moment should have been given to Leia or Admiral Ackbar. Hell, where's Mon Mothma? The moment was one of the few cool things in the movie, wasted on this terrible character.<br/><br/>- Speaking of General Tumblr, why doesn't she just tell Poe what the plan is? Oh right, they needed a plot thread to bash "toxic masculinity" over the head. They needed to show Poe "mansplaining" her over and over again to drive home how terrible males are. I usually laugh when people say movies are SJW propaganda, this time...I'm not laughing.<br/><br/>- Princess Leia floating through space was terrible. Absolutely abysmal.<br/><br/>- Luke Skywalker was given the worst treatment. - Rian did all these "double twists" to shock the audience, but really it just seemed extremely lazy. A sort of combination of the M-Night Shaymalalianlyn twist, meets a horror movie jump scare. For example....<br/><br/>(1) Oh no, Leia is dead! GOTCHA! She's gonna float back into the ship through space!<br/>(2) Oh wow, Kylo just took out Snoke and is going to join Rey! GOTCHA, he was just taking over the First Order!<br/>(3) Holy **** Luke Skywalker finally came out of retirement! GOTCHA, he was a hologram, he survives! GOTCHA AGAIN, he actually doesn't survive, he dies because he used up his force powers!<br/>(4) Oh no, they couldn't find the code hacker! Now they're in jail! GOTCHA, a stuttering Benecio Del Toro is their cellmate and just happens to be a hacker that will help them out! GOTCHA AGAIN, he's gonna betray them for the First Order!<br/>(5) So Finn and Rose are gonna die, apparently? GOTCHA, Finn is gonna fight off Phasma again with three swipes of a sword and kick her into a pit.<br/>(6) Rey and Luke's big moment from Force Awakens is finally here! GOTCHA, it isn't big, it's comedic relief. Luke hucks the "laser sword" away like a syphilis ridden ****<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I've made my point. The double twist didn't "Subvert expectations," it felt forced every single time. Every "rug pulling" moment was supposed to be this big revelation. I can imagine Rian standing with a beaming smile, arms crossed as each double twist unfolds. But really, the result isn't some shocking revelation, it's like someone runs up and gives you a wet willy, or a wedgie, or points on your right shoulder than slinks off to the left. Only to spit in your face when you turn around.<br/><br/>That's another thing, this movie has "Nolan Batman" syndrome in that it characters FRANKLY EXPRESS THEIR MOTIVATIONS AND EMOTIONS. You ever hear of "Show, don't tell"? And it moves beyond just characters motivations, the Disney corporation even shoe-horned it's own agenda into the film, unsurprisingly through Dark Emo Jedi Kylo Ren. "KILL THE PAST. KILL THE PAST. THE PAST IS DEAD." Or, in other words, the verbal confirmation that this is, in fact, a giant double handed middle finger to fans of Star Wars.<br/><br/>KILL THE PAST! KILL THE PAST! How about kill the past 3 hours wasted in the cinema on this hokey, forced, bland series of double twists? If you really break the movie down, it's 4 scenes stretched way beyond their amusement. 1) Space battle / space chase<br/>2) Luke "training" Rey, and Rey face-timing Kylo<br/>3) Casino Heist<br/>4) Reverse Hoth (with salt instead of snow)<br/><br/>One last thing, why the **** does everyone keep saying "THIS IS SO UNLIKE STAR WARS!" The double twists really got your nips that hard? This is just as much a rehash as Force Awakens. It just borrowed moments from across all three OT films, rather than being A New Hope. For example, the throne room scene from ROTJ, Battle of Hoth from ESB with salt instead of snow, Rey training under a goofy acting exiled Jedi Master and eventually facing her psychological demons in a dark cave / tree when staring into her own face, "We got away too easy, they're tracking us" but it's THROUGH HYPERSPACE this time, guys, what a fresh innovation!<br/><br/>I'm usually lenient on films. "It wasn't that bad, guys!" But his was a failed remake, failed reboot, and failed sequel all in one. Nice hat trick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It turns the subtle humor into pure camp slapstick.  It invalidates the original's journey of heroes by placing them all in a universe of ultimate failure, deep self-doubt, and sorrow for what could have been.  It destroys well-loved characters in meaningless moments.  Literally everything about this film is Anti-StarWars.  Massive plot holes and ignored history are almost championed as the CGI dazzles your eyes, and the "powerful females" and "heroes aren't real, everyone is their own hero" memes are inserted erratically and without any real emotion.  I think BB-8 is a good metaphor for this movie overall: instead of the charming and beloved character you got with R2D2, here you get a constantly spinning mess with no soul or love, and occasionally the head flies off because humor or something.  This movie is an insult to movie-making, an insult to fans of the Star Wars universe, and an insult to storytelling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is by far the worst star wars movie i've ever seen. I'm a big fan of the saga and i was left literally heartbroken. During the movie i buried my face in popcorns twice out of shame.<br/>Ok, let's say just a couple of things about tlj. Are you a fan of the saga? If the answer is yes, this movie will **** all over everything you have ever loved about star wars. They took everything that was meaningful in the star wars universe and twisted it, changed it, made it into a pathetic pre made cartouche of banalized philosophical little thoughts for masses. This one was the first issue for me, but let's put that one aside for a moment and let's try to be as objective as we can.<br/><br/>Let's say i've never seen a star wars movie. The film opens with one of the worst exchange of jokes i can remember of. Throught the movie, the humor stands on the same level, and sometimes it get even worse. The screenwriter must have been drunk.<br/><br/>The plot is so messy and makes little to no sense. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the movie is too complex for an average person to understand what's happening, as in the case of movies like Naked Lunch. It's simply a collage of incompatible subplots which scatter the movie focus all over the place. The banality of these subplots is sometimes so blatant that i could have closed my eyes and imagined a better story with thomas the tank engine as rey, spongebob as finn and a rock as rose.<br/><br/>You know what? I could honestly keep going for half an hour, but i would be wasting time. The reasons why this movie is a terrible pile of crap is so obvious that its score should be already underground if not in the reign of the negative dimension. The fact that it isn't means that there is no point in staying here and discussing why it was bad. I mean, it's like asking yourself "would Hitler be a good president for the United States?". Why would you even need to do that? The answer is CLEAR AS PURE WATER. Critic score for this movie made me question the true nature of reality. I live in an illusion and i'm the only one seeing that. May the force be with me, and may star wars be as far as possible from me. "I don't know who the producers at disney are, but now i'm sure they're the true bad guys of the serie"</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Yeah well **** it Luke decided he just doesn't care and wants to die. Remember how it's supposed to take years before jedi even attain the rank of padawan and then BEGIN training with a lightsababer? Lol please, Rey's got that skywalker blood, she basically takes on Luke (the most powerful force user ever) no problem with zero training. Remember how the good guys win (although being at a huge disadvantage) by outsmarting the bad guys? Nah, no need for that lets just make them oblivious to anything resembling a logical thought.<br/><br/>Let me summarize how the movie should have gone, if it made any sense. The first order attacks as resistance is evacuating, resistance manages to get away but the first order tracks them, resistance gets attacked again moments after escaping from first order but first orders big fleet is too slow at keeping up with resistance's smaller fleet, after seeing how Kylo and about 4 Tie fighters manage so blow up the command section of the resistance's main ship they decide to send in more of their smaller ships and everyone dies, the end. If you've never seen any of the older movies or have any previous knowledge on the star wars universe, this could probably pass as an okay movie. But if not save your money, this movie literally just says **** it to all the previous lore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The last jedi. I think it was debuted to the empire strike back same story same darkness theme.I like this movie because the empire strike back is the best in star wars saga. So that story came back to the starting point again. That the end it will be the same as return of the jedi.In the begining Lucas say the trilogys has 3 parts 1 new hope 2 clone wars and 3 rebuilt the old republic.In hand of disney.They dont want to end this for more money.So in the fourth trilogy there will be story of Ben Solo.How he came to the dark side.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The alt right should be praising this film as 11/10 cultural victory. As for the rest of us politically non-binary people this film osculates from cringe humour to edgy social snow flakery commentary. I loved the lack of self awareness from Disney with the Casino planet. Yup a nice sharp dig at Capitalism and the rich. WTF is Disney, but the very thing they condemn a rich capitalistic giant.

I am pleased with most parts of the movie. Its just that Disney tried to show itself as a cultural diversity loving company by shoving as many non-white characters as they can. Don't get me wrong i'm all for cultural diversity and feminism (not the stupid kind) but when its as blatant and forced as in this movie I can't stand it. Other then that I loved the acting and visuals and the comedy is more then usual but I still love it. The action is nice but the movie moved at a slightly shorter pace then its brother The Force Awakens.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As a reference, I enjoyed TFA and was looking forward to see more development of the characters and storyline.  This director decided to throw all that away and stamp his own flawed vision on the franchise.  The writing at plot are a mess and there are so many plot holes it begs reasoning.  The treatment of Luke in this films is unforgivable.  The only reason i'm posting this opinion is that this director currently has more star wars movies slated to do, and Disney needs to take those away.  Too much damage already done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I really enjoyed Rouge One so i trusted Disney in this one.<br/>I was not dissapoined.<br/>The film is actually really nice Star Wars movie.<br/>I know there are a lot of mistakes in the film, but they didnt bother me at all!<br/>The plot is great but there is one catch. This movie was created to build the universe.<br/>The film itself doesnt answer many questions. If you want to find out these answers you need to buy books/comics or watch a tv series. So i see why The Last Jedi has so many negative reviews. It's not great movie itself, but i really enjoyed it.

It tries to hard to find humour in what is supposed to be a mostly serious movie and just feels off in star wars. Another thing I found very strange was the unbelieveabilty of some sequences, such as Leia being the only survivor of a massive ship explosion (what a coincidence) and kills off a fan favourite (Ackbar)to introduce Laura Dern into the mix. It definitely also tries to hard to introduce lots of other characters such as Rose, who accompanies Finn through the movie and then dies at the end. I mean, what was the point? Also, none of the rumours or theories turned out to be true leaving a lot disappointed after watching. It really didn't seem like the saga progressed and just felt like a filler for a hopefully much better Episode IX.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Beautiful, sometime original, with some fulgurance, but without a soul. What's baffling me is, that the most useless character in this new Trilogy, Rose, is one of the most well presented between them all... In like, 5 minutes, you know everything you need to appreciate her, she's honest, brave, has a strong temperament, she's devastated by the death of her sister, but willing to save/help the other in her honor, etc.<br/><br/>Why, oh why, didn't have they done the same for Rey, Finn, Kylo and Poe? Seriously, i don't care about them because i don't know them and i don't relate to them. Even after Two films, i know that Rey is an orphan, that she has follow BB-8 into the resistance because of... Han ? Maybe? And that she just want to save Kylo because of ... Han ? No, seriously, i don't know.<br/><br/>Finn, oh Finn, what a pity, he could have been so great, imagine just a second. Twenty year before the VII, Finn and Phasma are young  children, trained like soldier, brainwashed, mentally broke to become obedient killer. Phasma and Finn befriend in adversity, but they choose two different path, Finn only want to be discret, to become invisible, Phasma know that being the best is the only  way to stop the abuse. Twenty years later, Finn enter in Phasma's unit, and he discover what she had become, a ruthless killer.<br/><br/>But no, Phasma is a laughable caracter without a past, without motive, Finn is only an honest and gentle coward that try to escape, everything he try fail, and everytime sheer luck or someone else save him. It's saddening. He got a bit better in this movie, but his part of the plot serve nothing and fail. So...<br/><br/>Rey i already talked, i appreciate her a little more, she's an orphan, she wants to find her place in the galaxy, to know where she come from. It's okayish, she has some great moment in the movie.<br/><br/>Poe is the best pilot in the resistance, beyond human, but he is the worst officer. He just abandonned BB-8 in the VII, and got half is crew killed to destroy one ship... And that's all i knew of him. Kylo is ridiculous, less in this one, but seriously, why can't he use the freaking force when he fight? Those red guards, he could have break their bones in a twist, push them trough a wall, make them suffocate and....No... he only fight with his light saber because it make things more difficult, and it make the scene less impressive and less enjoyable... The part where he is linked to Rey is great, but it lacks something... And Kylo lack something, he want to become a second Vador, but why ? Did Snoke used a trick to make a false "ghost of Anakin" appear to young Ben and drive him to the dark side, telling him is destiny is to be the Supreme Ruler of all living being ?<br/><br/>Snoke is a NPC  with a quest, he appear, tell Kylo to find a map, then to find Rey, and then he disappear. No past, no motive, nothing...<br/><br/>Luke, it's not my Luke, it's not George Lucas or Mark Hamill's Luke, but it's a good Luke, an original one at least, i can live with that. I hoped he made a greater impact, and a most impressive show of strength, but it was entertaining.<br/><br/>Leia use actively the force for the first time, not how i imagine it, but why not, the special effect where pretty bad, but the scene was not that incoherent. A human can survive in space for a minute, Leia is a powerful untrained jedi, so she can survive longer without massive injuries. Her being unconsicous was necessary to the BAD plot, because Poe would have known there was a master plan and half the movie would have cease to exist, so... But, i need to know, was their a sas somewhere or a shield? because when they open the door to the command center room, the corridor should have depressurized!<br/><br/>And more importantly, if gravity don't interfere with light speed, has seen with the millenium falcon getting through the starkiller shield directly into the atmosphere in the VII, why don't they use x-wing has missile ? They have hundreds of them (has seen on Leia computer at the start), they could send two by First order destroyer, even if the first order produce interdictor cruiser, they work by creating gravity around them, soooo, freewin for the resistance, hell yeah.<br/><br/>Sorry for the long text, and for my english, it's not my native language, and i rarely practice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The action scenes are very fun (Especially the opening dreadnought scene), Mark Hamill's role as Luke is very good and makes it genuinely seem like "Yes, this is a hero to a galaxy, who imposed exile on himself out of shame of nearly killing a student.", and the film generally does a lot of things right. There are a few flaws however. The film is only 2 1/2 hours long, but it feels like almost double due to the nature of one of the main plot points (Everything that's left of The Resistance is on a ship being chased by The Supremacy, the 1st Order flagship. The Resistance ship is just out of range, and is continuously flying away.) Also, HOW THE **** DOES THE SCENE WITH LEIA IN SPACE WORK? Those 2 issues keep it from giving me a perfect 10, but it's still a great film to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7969404"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">When I first saw the user review scores for this movie I was a little surprised. I mean the concept of a star wars movie being on par with the skyline sequel seems impossible.For the first week of the movie's release I had to try (and usually fail) pretty hard to avoid spoilers,which frustrated me because even though I'm not the biggest star wars fan, I Loved the force awakens and wanted to experience it's sequel for what it is. Now That I've seen the movie,I will say that while this movie has been a bit over hated by the audience, it was in my opinion, thoroughly disappointing. I feel that the biggest flaw with this movie is simply that it doesn't feel like a star wars film. Putting the series in perspective, it's backbone has always been each movie's feeling of adventure. "A new hope" kick started the franchise because it not only created an enthralling universe, but took it's heroes through a variety of locations and scenarios which gave the audience a feeling of excitement and progression. Like an amusement park, there was something new and interesting around every corner. Now let's look at the last Jedi. The concept of a Star Wars movie having a plot taking place over the course of like, two days seems like a cardinal sin. I remember the exact moment in this movie where my expectations dropped. The first twenty minutes of the film started off on the right foot, (Grand scale space battles aren't new to this franchise, but they don't get old easy.) I felt a little nervous however, when they mentioned that the bombing fleet the resistance loses in the beginning was all the bombers they had, and then they say that the resistance is down to a few hundred people spread across four ships. How can it be a war if one side has a single army? And if that is all that's left, then they must not hold any planets either. This isn't a war anymore, it's just what is essentially the government running down some convicts. This may seem like a petty complaint, but it seriously damaged my enjoyment of the film when I was supposed to believe that we can still logically root for such a small force to win the war. But that's not the moment where I lost hope in this movie, it was when during the battle, the resistance resolves to keep out of the enemy ships range and think of a plan. I remember thinking to myself "They better not stay there the whole movie." But hey, guess what the plot is about? slow attrition. On top of all that,the movie Seems to have a general theme of everyone failing to do everything.To go into better detail about this, look at how each of the three subplots plays out. The mutiny subplot is slow paced and is ultimately pointless as the people fighting have no reason to. a third of this movie is literally about people considering violence against one another over misinformation. The casino subplot is based on the pointlessness of the mutiny story, and is full of weird, animal rights messages,some of the worst costume design in recent memory, (Those police officers in specific) A pointless drunkard character, and a "Big reveal" that the resistance has some evil tenancies too, which is really just saying they had the audacity to buy weapons when they were trying to win a war. The subplot about Rey's training was probably the best part of the movie, but it still destroyed the legacy of one of cinema's most recognizable figures by making Luke into a depressed old man who's lost all faith. On top of all this, the movie also undoes all of the progress made in the last film. "Oh, the resistance destroyed the star killer base? well too bad, apparently that one solar system we saw get destroyed was the entire republic, and the first order won the war. "so we found Luke and he's gonna save everyone right?" Nope, he wanted to go missing, and has gone from an understanding force for good to a close minded old man who wants to end the Jedi order. This movie wasn't just bad because it was a disappointing sequel, it's bad because it voids all of the powerful moments in it's superior predecessor. I think my last real complaint is that I really don't know what the message of the story was. At first I thought it was "Move on from the past", but that's the mentality the villain holds on to. So... what is it? after recalling the plot, the only moral I can find is "Hope is good" Which isn't just generic, but it's the message of the entire franchise, we need something a little more specific for individual movies. All in all, this movie is worth a watch if you want to follow the plot, but it wasn't the continuation we wanted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Other reviewers have deconstructed the film and highlighted its many flaws so I won't retread the same ground. But perhaps I can add this: More than any of The Last Jedi's structural flaws - e.g., narrative and character dissonance - to me the most heartbreaking aspect of the film is its underlying cynicism, both in its worldview and its message.<br/><br/>It tells us there is no such thing as good and evil (it's all just shades of grey) and that those who seek moral clarity are on the wrong side of history.<br/><br/>It tells us that "hero worship" is wrong and should be avoided because our heroes (like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo before him) will inevitably fail and let us down.<br/><br/>It tells us that the past needs to be 'killed' because it's useless, serving no purpose other than as a lesson of what not to do.<br/><br/>It tells us that anyone can achieve greatness, not through hard work, effort and sacrifice but through rejecting one's culture, traditions, institutions, and heritage.<br/><br/>It tells us that laying down one's life for another is wrong because that's tantamount to hate and killing who and what one loves.<br/><br/>It tells us that we can learn absolutely nothing about our identity from our parents, even though our parents conceived, nurtured and brought us into the world. I can't think of a message more antithetical to "Star Wars" - the Star Wars George Lucas created all those years ago (post-Kennedy, post-Vietnam, post-Watergate) than that.<br/><br/>And it just breaks my heart.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are great scenes, but there are just that -- scenes. The movie as a whole suffers to being focused on too many things at once. Think the ending battle of The Phantom Menace but for the entire film and more boring.<br/><br/>Did the movie throw a ton of fan theories out the window? Yes. Was it entertaining? Yes. That's why I gave it a 5. The other 5 points are for substance and this movie has no substance. Only one of the three or four subplots the movie has is interesting (the Luke & Rey plot) and even that plot is plagued by an out of character Luke Skywalker. I will say that Mark Hamill did a great job with what he was given. Finn's subplot is meaningless in the film and I hated Poe Dameron more and more as the movie went on. There was no logic to what he was doing the entire time. Kylo Ren shows promise but director Rian Johnson never really has the confidence to pull off a daring plot twist as far as both Rey or Ren is concerned. And if you're expecting anything from Hux, Snoke, or Phasma in this film...don't.<br/><br/>Out of place humor ruins several moments in this movie. Whoever came up with island nun-janitors and a scene where Luke milks an animal in front of the audience should no longer work on a Star Wars script. Every Force user in this movie is incredibly overpowered and I'm sure it will leave a ton of casual Star Wars fans utterly confused as to what is going on on screen. Leia in particular has a cringeworthy moment that will take you out of the movie. Lastly, a certain character from the first six films briefly returns and unleashes an ability so overpowered you will wonder why they never attempted it before, specifically in Return of the Jedi. The film creates several saga plot holes in this way.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of George Lucas' first six films, I don't think you'll like this film. You may enjoy watching it, but liking it is another story. If you liked The Force Awakens, you will be disappointed by the way that Rian Johnson throws any promise the film had in the garbage. Did this movie ruin my childhood and is it one of the worst movies of all time? Absolutely not. But it is, in my opinion, the worst Star Wars movie to date. The movie is just a mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The plot is empty and the movie ends exactly where it started, except for some killings during some battles. None of the questions left by The Force Awakens find an answer: where does Rey came from? Why is Rey so close to the Force? Who are the Knights of Ren? Where does Snoke came from? Rey barely begin her apprentice as a Jedi, making no progress from TFA. What about Kylo? For the whole movie it seems like he’s going to fall with the light side, then wakes up and gets evil. Instead of the typical British humor director Rian Johnson used a blatant American humor that was way too off contest. It was interesting to see both good and evil for each character, but this is all I found good in the whole movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

We don't learn anything about the characters or why they do the things they do.  We don't learn why Snoke is interested in fighting the Jedi or where he came from.  Rey still hasn't received any training and yet, is the equivalent of Kylo Ren (all the Mary Sue accusers here gain traction to a film that could've easily negated their arguments).  The characters do stupid things that serve no purpose to the story other than to say, "oh look, here's some vague and shallow demonstration of failure or growth".<br/><br/>The dialogue was out of place and wonky.  You had awkward phrases and sayings like "Godspeed" or "chrome dome" or "laser swords" which doesn't belong in a galaxy far, far way.<br/><br/>The humor was awful and killed all the tension in the film.  It's as if the writer thought the Marvel movie quips were suited for the SW universe and brought it in to supplement all the violence and genocide.  Likewise, they wasted 30 minutes of the film dedicated to a boring casino subplot that ended up irrelevant to the plot.  Totally poor direction here.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's just a huge disappointment. I am certain that I will NOT be watching the next two Star Wars films.  Likewise, I fear they will ruin the Obi-Wan film which will come after.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Feeling a bit betrayed by critics who were either paid off or scared into creating false hype to push up the opening weekend, though I see the numbers are now plummeting as people hear just how bad TLJ really is. There is absolutely no way those were all honest reviews. I saw the film the day it came out with a theater full of excited fans, and you could feel the energy drain out of them as the film wore on. This is the first time I've heard actual booing at the end of a Star Wars film, even the worst of the prequels didn't create this kind of bitter disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Having to constantly burn fuel, even when not accelerating. Bombs dropping from bombers without gravity (maybe propulsion down?? maybe). FO ships can just light jump ahead or out and back in to catch the rebels. FO bombardment shots rising and falling as they are magically pulled down by gravity in space.<br/>Allowing your entire fleet to die one at a time instead of jumping in 4 different directions. The big ship won't track them all and they knew they were being tracked. FLYING **** LEIA.<br/>PURPLE HAIR LESBIAN NOT SAYING A THING TO POEabout her dumb plan(who is suppose to be their lead fighter commander, a senior(ish) officer in general, and the information is not dangerous at all. The Finn and Rose plotline is a horrendous sideshow which acts as its own crappy kid's movie. Adds nothing to the plot and makes no sense. How can Rey swim when she grew up on a sand, desert planet?<br/>Why did luke leave a map for people to find him, if he went to die?<br/>I GUESS THE RESISTENCE WAS AND IS THE REPUBLIC AND THEY CONSIST OF JUST 5 PLANETS FROM TFA AND 4 SPACE SHIPS. where is the galactic outrage or swelling of troops from the starkiller base attack on the republic? Where is the republic fleets and soldiers and other planets? You're telling me in a matter of days or weeks the first order conquered the galaxy? Luke wanting to kill Kylo, when he wouldnt even turn on his evil dad and it actually worked turning the good inside of him back out. So no reason he wouldnt pursue the good in kylo. THE LACK OF BATTLES THAT ARE MEANINGFUL OR VISUAL OR ACTION PACKED.<br/>oh our plan is to run, then run to a planet and hide behind a door... how retarded... but a purple haired lesbian did concieve it.<br/>IN ROGUE ONE THE REBEL SHIPS JUMP TO LIGHT SPEED AND CRASH INTO THE STAR DESTROYER, BUT NOW A SHIP CAN JUMP TO HYPERDRIVE AND DECIMATE AN ENTIRE FLEET. people will say it is because its a bigger more shielded ship, but Snoke's ship is way way bigger than it, just like in rogue one. Total **** and if one ship can do that, it woulda been done in losing battles years ago. Why not hyperdrive thru the death star? STUPID!<br/>Why didnt the FO just hyperdrive in the 30 seconds or so they knew what holdo was going to do?<br/>Porgs and Sea cow tit milk....<br/>The DJ character knowing about the rebel plan... impossible. The fact that the FO couldnt even see, scan or hypothesize what the rebels were doing running to a planet, also asinine.<br/>THE AVATAR PROJECTION LUKE AND BATTLE...dumb and meant to trick by deus ex machina<br/>Rose turning around and catching up to side swipe Finn impossible.<br/>Rose and Finn not dying in the crash or from subsequent AT-AT fire... dumb<br/>Rose and finn love affair...dumb<br/>Finn dragging fatass shrek back thru the battlefield to the base dumb. So much **** dumb dumb dumb. So much more, but Im out of patience. Total, utter **** especially for star wars.

Is TLJ a perfect movie? By no means. But it's a very good Star Wars film. As a lifelong fan of Star Wars that read almost eveyr piece of EU content, and is currently caught up on all the current Canon, all the complaints people have about story and characters are unfounded. The only issues with this film are messy editing, misplaced comedy, and a few scenes that feel out of place. TLJ is finally taking Star Wars in a new and exciting direction. I made my review a 10 to make up for all the **** spamming "0" ratings. Realistically, I would give the movie an 8. It was a very good movie, but it had too many issues to ascend to greatness. Metacritic, you would get more REAL reviews if you did something about your bot problem. I'd like to see what this movie's score would be if you took out all the 0s, 1s, and 2s to remove obvious spammers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Despite the acting, the prequels had many redeeming qualities such as a story that greatly expanded the universe of starwars, epic and unique soundtracks and awesome lightsaber battles. The new trilogy has none of them, this latest edition least of all. My issues with this film summed up:<br/>- Really bad jokes that felt shoehorned in. The iron space ship, seriously? Why take the mick out of Slave 1? - A Janitor storm trooper that knows all the weaknesses of all the stations and battleships. Terrible strategy First Order. Educating all your storm troopers in how to take them down, great for when they defect or get captured.<br/>- Tracking through hyperspace!? OMG! wait, so how did Jango Fett and Boba Fett track their targets decades ago then? - So Ray doesn't need any training to become a Jedi it seems. She is naturally good with a lightsaber despite never training with one. - Luke's first instinct was to murder Kylo? He turned Vader back to the light so he knows it could be done. - How did Leia get back into the ship after her little space walk without it sucking everyone out?<br/>- Could Kylo be any worse at fighting with a lightsaber?<br/>- So lasers have a range in space? That makes sense. - Also why not send out the small strike craft Hux? Where were all your bombers and tie fighters? Seriously!<br/>- The aiming of the giant AT-ATs was atrocious when shooting at the salt ski things, I don't know how they survived.<br/>- Purple Giraffe General seemed to take an eternity before deciding to help stop the transport ships from getting shot down.<br/>- Phasma was utterly useless again. - Far too many misleading moments, they felt so cheap.<br/>- The whole trip to the casino planet seemed pointless. What did Finn and co achieve? Got captured twice and released some animals. Such a hero.<br/>- Second film in the trilogy with a snow (sigh salt) planet base getting assaulted by walkers. - Who was Snoke? Where did he come from? What was he up to when the Emperor was calling the shots?<br/>- Po was useless.<br/>- The entire film was pointless, it was filled with pointless failed missions that did not further the story in any way.<br/>- The falcon seems to be in prime condition despite its age and obvious poor condition in the original trilogy.<br/>- Far far far too many last minute save the day moments!! - Poor unmemorable soundtrack. Equally as bad as the Force Awakened, if not worse. It is obvious this trilogy has been designed for the sole purpose of making money. Forget telling a great story, it seems Disney only cares about the money. It has been dumbed down to cater for the younger generation at the expense of the older generation that grew up with Star Wars. Makes sense as a business point of view, after all they will out live us oldens. For the record though, I loved Rogue One!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Forced humor that drains the tension from the film is everywhere along with the obvious characters/creatures created purely for merchandising. The First Order went from being a Galaxy threatening force to just a few ships that can't catch, destroy or out maneuver Rebel ships. Huxley is now a buffoon, existing for no other reason than forced comedy. Phasma is just as underused and pointless as ever. Rey is even more of a Mary Sue than before, she's better at everything than anybody else in the galaxy, never needs training and therefore there is no danger or tension any time she's on screen. Mark Hamill plays someone called Luke, but it's definitely not Luke Skywalker from the original trilogy. Snoke, the big mysterious bad guy is literally wasted. Leia is Mary Poppins as she flies through the vacuum of space. Fin and Rose are absolutely pointless in this film, their whole side adventure is poorly written and serves no purpose. Benicio Del Toro is wasted, like everyone else. How Rian Johnson handled Luke is just a middle finger to fans.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson doesn't understand how the vacuum of space works. Ships (bombers) move slowly through space even though weight has no bearing on speed at sub light. Rebel ships are "faster" than First Order ships, but they only get outside of firing range and then match speed...? Leia opens a door to the destroyed bridge and the hallway with people in it does not explosively decompress. ???<br/><br/>The whole movie is a long, boring chase sequence in space that is the most disrespecting and poorly written dumpster fire in Hollywood history. You're not missing anything if you haven't seen it. It's trash and Rian Johnson should be banned from the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's time to grow up and that isn't comfortable. The movie explores themes that directly put a mirror up the audience and asks questions about the nature of idolization, wish fulfillment, nostalgia, expectations & labels, authority, blind respect, communication, nature of war, looking at things in black & white, over reactions & rash decisions, ego, failure & how to deal with it, trauma and holding onto the past in ways that aren't healthy, moving forward in ways which aren't healthy, symbols vs real people, fame, responsibility, identity, aging, younger generations relationship to older ones, and in particular coming to terms with the fact that the older generation may not be perfect or even right and the responsibility the current generation now faces knowing there isn't a clear answer to these big problems or someone to turn to answer them. These are all things that are uncomfortable to face initially but they are universal themes that should be taught, much like the themes that we hold so deal to our heart that the original trilogy gave us. Give the movie another viewing, with an open mind and a level head. It is messy, and very flawed in a lot of aspects, but let's not let those things blind us so we can see the forest beyond the trees. There are very mature, nuanced things that the movie explores, new things, perhaps unpleasant things and we can agree it didn't get there in the best manner. It played with subversion in some dramatic areas it shouldn't have and perhaps was a bit cynical, goofy or shortsighted in others, but I'll take those flaws in order to get the concepts it brought to light. Upon a 2nd viewing most of the negative things weren't all that bad either. The pacing felt better (particularly the casino scene), things didn't feel as awkward and off, and the overall the annoying aspects just weren't as glaring or distracting and I could actually enjoy what was the film was doing as opposed to being irritated or on guard with what would come next. I even think if you view it through a meta perspective you can possibly have some campy fun in some of the weaker moments too. Overall it's a flawed film and there are things that it lacks no matter what, but if you're patient and can look past your differences with the film, it offers some really amazing insights & ideas for not just a Star Wars film, but a blockbuster film.  Asking us a very mature, adult question; to move past our fantasies & gut reactions and to take a breath & move forward with perspective in all aspects of life. That's something I'm thrilled that it did and it makes me proud to continue calling myself a lifelong Star Wars fan. 1st Viewing: 6.5 out of 10<br/>2nd Viewing: 8.5 out of 10 (10 was to balance out the irrational 0's & 1's)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Absolutely awful story that answers nothing from the previous movie and actually takes a dump on the entire franchise, wish I would have stayed home along with the everyone else I took with me.  Looks like I'll have to return some toys this Christmas considering the kids now think Star Wars is a joke, and my kids are 5 and 3.

The writing is bad in terms of story telling, pacing, and dialogue. And it undermines all of the previous material that had been created in the previous 7 movies. Its an OK/fine/little empty movie on its own but its greatest sin is diminishing the movies that came before it. Which is really the worst thing any Star Wars movie can do. Kudos to Mark Hamill for standing up and saying what many of us feel. "That was not our Luke Sky Walker and not our Star Wars."</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Im only going to talk about one thing, the mood of the movie. There was too much comedic relief when it should never have been there. The original three had Han Solo and his sarcasm and interactions between his friends, as humor. It was done perfectly. In this movie, at any point they could, they added some joke that typically wasnt appropriate for the scene. It felt like I was watching a different movie entirely. When the very beginning reminds me of "Space Balls"...something has been done wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7966961"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">For many people Star Wars opens a door to a world of escapism, full of dynamic action, loveable characters and great settings. But at it's core many will tell you that Star Wars is more than that. The movies incorporate important morales while using a refined and effective structure to its story, which is often a high point of the performance. But sadly The Last Jedi touches upon so little of the above while continuously tripping and falling over the tripwires of its own faults. The movies Plot can easily be summed up in a few sentences, this might appeal to some people but for years it seemed Star Wars tried to tell a compelling story whether it was complicated or not. But there are too many head scratching moments in the film on top of a basic and uninteresting story. There also includes a side plot involving Finn and newcomer Rose, but this side plot is ultimately pointless and changes very little. The plot also highlights what would seem to be a disregard Rian Johnson has for the Force Awakens. For example it is made clear in Force Awakens that Luke Skywalker left a map to his location so that he may be acquired in times of need, yet in The Last Jedi he has bitter opinions on fighting with the resistance. Rian Johnson also seems to disregard the many triumphs of JJ Abrahams in Force Awakens. Supreme Emperor Snoke was built up to be an intimidating and mysterious villain but Johnson allows him to die pathetically with the audience knowing nothing of his past. But one thing the plot does excellently is build the relationship between Rey and Ben, by having them connect by the force and share dialogue they can better sort out their differences and find answers for questions. This means they can build their relationship together before confronting one another on the battlefield.  But to put it lightly The Last Jedi has an unstructured, unfaithful, simplistic story with confusing elements. One area that it is difficult to critique is the action, so allow me to praise it. The Last Jedi is at it's best when resistance pilots are gracefully wrecking havoc on First Order ships or when infantry are dodging the blasts of the towering Imperial Walkers. All of this is set against a triumphant soundtrack which suits the Movie oh so well. There are also a great many light sabre battles that are carried out with such fluid movements, energy and suspense that I have only appreciation for the Movie's cast. As is typical with any Star Wars the GCI is a sight to be held with the Action taking advantage of the valuable resource provided by such a talented team. Lastly I would like to touch upon what many would consider the most controversial subject of the Last Jedi, that being the Character of Luke Skywalker. In previous Movie's Luke is a symbol for optimism, kindness, hope and confidence. One of his most compelling moments involved a life risking mission to the emperors doorstep because Luke was convinced he could change his Darth Vader's ways, he believed in the good nature of one of Cinema's most infamous bad guys. He was successful and thus proved the message of the franchise, that being that People can change. Now Rian Johnson has completely gone against that. In the Movie Luke is a typical grouchy, unpleasant and cynical old man for about two thirds of the film. His death in the film is also somewhat anti climactic. So side with Mark Hamill on the basis of Luke's character and "I fundamentally disagree"<br/>This review does not at all affect any opinion that you might have of The Last Jedi and you can still enjoy more than I did, it is just my belief that a franchise so groundbreaking and so fascinating needs to be handled with delicate care and consideration towards future instalments. This is something that Rian Johnson did not deliver on in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Yes, the tone was a bit uneven and that part with Leia in outer space was unintentionally funny, but this installment had solid character development. The new characters were given their due, and Luke and Leia had some wonderful moments. Bottom line, it's not as good as the Force Awakens, but it's light years better than episodes 1-3 (and Return of the Jedi).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It does not look like a Star Wars movie. Many things do not match the saga.<br/><br/>Luke at the beginning of the film, with all due respect, looks like a loser!<br/><br/>Rey's "training" was ridiculous.<br/><br/>In addition, the film does not seem to make much sense. (My vision)<br/><br/>Things that never happen, happen in the movie and without any explanation.<br/><br/>Simply read Levite in space. Luke creates a homogram for you.<br/><br/>Did not like.<br/><br/>The supreme lord dies of **** It is unbelievable that the "lord of evil" dies with a lightsaber at his side, not realizing that he will be activated and simply dies.<br/><br/>How can the "villain" of the movie die like this? No explanation of where he came and dying roughly.<br/><br/>If you are a fan, go watch and draw your own conclusions.<br/><br/>Personally, I did not like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I've watched the movie in the theatre, thought about watching it a second time, but I really did not like many things in this movie. So instead of giving Disney more of my money, I've came here to express my point of view.<br/><br/>The director ignored many aspects and plots from previous movies and novels of the franchise. Even from The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>I felt that many characters were thrown there just to be a mean to an end, even the big ones. Which I think it's not a big problem if you are making a movie in a new universe, or trying to push a new franchise/saga. But it can be a big problem on a well stabilished universe like this.<br/><br/>A lot of things that could have been or needed to be explained, are just ignored or like Rian Johnson himself later said "aren't important to the history", or "weren't important in the 70s movie".<br/><br/>They had an oportunity to make an amazing trilogy, where the old character passes the torch to the new hero and teaches her about the things that he did right and wrong, so she can become even stronger than him. And they could have done it in a way that feels respectful, nostalgic, coherent with the character and at the same time showing that he is not a perfect being.<br/><br/>But they didn't. And in my point of view, there are things in this movie that some Star Wars fans may find wrong, incoherent and in some cases even downright insulting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Even the prequels avoided this dishonor. Mark Hammill himself has complained publicly about the newest version of Luke Skywalker, saying he completely disagrees with everything written for his character, but he was forced via contract to do the movie despite his disagreement.<br/><br/>The Force Awakens was a rip-off of A New Hope story- and plot-wise, but at least it was a true Star Wars movie. The Last Jedi however is an abomination, even though it has some great battle/fight scenes and a few interesting character dynamics (Luke vs Rey, Rey vs Kylo, and Luke vs Kylo).<br/><br/>The main story is all about a whole fleet chasing but not catching a single big ship which can't warp its way out with its warp engines, and it includes a really stupid sub-plot (the "code breaker in the casino" one with Benicio del Toro) in the middle.<br/><br/>Other than Luke Skywalker, the old heroes get limited screentime. We still got no answers about many questions raised from The Force Awakens movie, like who's this Snoke guy, and who are these Knights of Ren? We will likely never know, especially since Snoke has been killed off in the most anti-climactic way ever.<br/><br/>What I can tell for sure is that Episode 9 will have Rey and Kylo face each other in a final showdown, but I am not sure it will even be a Star Wars movie (if only in name). I really hoped to like The Last Jedi after the controversy of The Force Awakens, but it unfortunately disappointed me.<br/><br/>Good job dear Kathleen Kennedy, I am pretty sure next time Disney will produce an even worse movie than The Last Jedi.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
