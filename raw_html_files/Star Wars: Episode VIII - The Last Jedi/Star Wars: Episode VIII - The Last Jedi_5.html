If Johnson was chosen to continue his character arcs from The Last Jedi, here are my expectations for his Episode 9 (let’s just see what JJ Abrams does?):<br/><br/>1. Low on food and supplies, the 9 remaining Rebels flee to Ahch-To to call all remaining resistance supporters to this new base, while milking sea cows and BBQing Porgs for nourishment.<br/>2. Luke, who DIDN'T really disappear into the Force (his mechanical hand didn’t drop onto the meditation stone, did it!?), but rather created a Force Teleport, returns to Tatooine to live in Kenobi's old home. Luke disconnects from the Force for the last time and begins scaring Tusken Raiders away from lost droids who venture off into the desert.<br/>3. Princess Leia, stricken with grief from the loss of Han and now her brother (or so she thinks), dies from a broken heart while traveling to Ach-To!!! However, we only get to read about this in the title crawl for Episode 9! :’(<br/>4. Kylo Ren, decides he can't live without Rey (Rey-LO!!!) since his Force Touch experience with her, throws Admiral Hux against a wall (again, again, again, again…) and deserts the First Order to search for Rey.<br/>5. Admiral Hux, whose face has been badly scared and injured from Kylo's repeated attacks, creates a mask to hide his face, and takes over as the new Supreme Leader. His first major decision is to change the name from the First Order to the Best Order.<br/>6. Finn, after trying to sacrifice his life to save the Resistance and finally bringing “meaning” to his life, struggles from depression which makes him flee the Rebels via a “secret” escape pod on the Millennium Falcon (even Han and Chewy didn't know existed) and returns to the First Order, only to complete his stormtrooper training and become the new Captain Phasma.<br/>7. Rose, finally fixes the hyperdrive on the Falcon after all these years!<br/>8. Chewbecca, rotisseries all the Porgs inside the Millennium Falcon and falls in love with Rose, who fixed the hyperdrive! They move to Canto Bight and adopt Force sensitive children.<br/>9. Rey, returns to Jakku to read the mind of Unkar Platt, and begins her journey in search for her drunk parents’ grave (who didn’t die but are casino bartenders on Canto Bight).<br/>10. Poe Dameron keeps blowing things up!<br/>11. Admiral Ackbar, who doesn’t breathe oxygen, realizes he TOO is Force sensitive, contacts Princess Leia (before she dies) to come and pick him up on their way to Ach-To.<br/>12. The young force sensitive boy on Canto Bight, leads a rebellion with more force sensitive kids against their captors to fight for better hourly wages while working with the Fathiers! They also fight for better treatment for the Fathiers, so these animals don’t have to run BACK-To-BACK races after returning from long planet voyages.<br/>13. Kenny Phasma, I mean Captain Phasma is DEAD for GOOD, so we don’t have to see any more lame fights!<br/>14. Supreme Leader Snoke, isn’t really dead! He was just using a really good puppet and will return for Episode 9 to reclaim his Empire from Kylo!!!!<br/>15. DJ, after becoming a multi-millionaire from turning Finn and Rose over to the First Order, returns to Canto Bight to begin building a better, and I mean a BETTER, and BIGGEST, and I mean really BIG, new Death Star to bring peace and happiness to the Galaxy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

That is to say that it upsets a lot of people because it doesn't actually bring any true 'resolution' to anything. In this case, upsetting 'fans' means getting very vocal, very negative response, because, Heaven forbid they actually think anything would go against what they want it to.  These "reviewers" can be safely ignored and discarded, as, they don't go into the film objectively, but looking for reasons to criticize the film.<br/><br/>Johnson took this film and made it something that was rather long, but visually amazing. He had the daunting task of making this movie what it was, which was something that was a true work of art. From the interaction of characters to creating a new one, he did this extremely well. His vision shows, and it was a good one.<br/><br/>This is a movie that you cannot just watch once and understand it. You simply cannot. There is so much to grasp and understand in this, you NEED to see it at least two, three times. Each time you do, you'll find that you get just a bit more insight into what's going on, into what the director had in mind, and what is clearly a great movie.<br/><br/>Is the movie perfect? No. Of course not. No movie is. However, to rate something negatively because it didn't match your expectations is just childish. To rate something negatively because it hurt your feelings is just childish. To claim that the movie "wrecked an entire franchise" because it isn't what you expect is just childish.<br/><br/>The critics got this one right, the "fans"? Not so much. These are the same "fans", however, that drove an actress off of social media because they harassed her so much.   These are the same "fans" however, that have taken over social media and troll anyone who DARES to speak good about Kennedy, Johnson, Abrams, or the SW franchise as a whole. These aren't fans, they are trolls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I say I wasn't really a fan of the Star Wars before I watched the 7th one, but this 'thing' just absolutely destroys everything the series has built.<br/><br/>So many things that are just so much wrong, but especially the existence of Rose. Ruins the flow of the movie so bad that it would have been much better without her and the stupid Casino sequence. Well, I'd rather not waste my ATPs writing about this pile of **** just two more things: parabolic orbit of laser guns in space and the almighty FTL Kamikaze attack.

It might even be better than Return of the Jedi. The vitriol surrounding this film stems from a disappointment that Luke didn't hold up to expectations built by the now de-canonized expanded universe novels. He's not the perfect superhuman here, which creates a far more compelling story of faith lost and regained. Look beyond the fanboy rage here, this is not only peak Star Wars, this is a great story of the reckless new generation finding their roles as leaders and taking charge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I tried to give Disney credit wherever it was due with my initial review (4/10), mostly due to some stellar cinematography and special effects... but I'm out now, I am completely out.<br/><br/>Plot holes galore, ham fisted liberal agenda moments, terrible writing and acting, the complete character assassination of Luke Skywalker, and lore-breaking scenes are just some of the topics that can be explored with no end to tear this abomination down.<br/><br/>Critical Fan Backlash:<br/><br/>The main reason I have come back to make sure this review is harshly critical, is simply because Disney has gone out of their way to blame fans for the poor reception. Rian Johnson, JJ Abrams, & Kathleen Kennedy have all come out publicly and attacked a fanbase that has absolutely loved and adored this series for years. I will not be watching Episode 9 because of this. Disney needs to face the facts, you hired a director with zero competence related to the Star Wars universe, who then pushed out a narrative that destroyed every subpar plot-line the previous instalment set up, whilst simultaneously destroying one of the most beloved movie characters of all time, and awkwardly inserting political agenda topics into a world where they do not belong or are not necessary. All this, and in turn, you attack the fans for the backlash of this movie and the failure of Solo???<br/><br/>I'm sorry but Disney has killed this franchise... If you are one of the people criticizing passionate fans for "crying" out, then you really have no idea how much a franchise could mean to someone. If they do not voice their displeasure with the series direction, then they are doing a disservice to themselves. I absolutely loved the original trilogy, enjoyed the prequels to an extent, and loved the older star wars video games, so it does kind of bother me to see it wind up like this... But, I can only imagine the disappointment of the more hardcore fans...<br/><br/>Characters:<br/><br/>"Out with the old, in with the new" is not supposed to be done like this... The new characters are absolutely awful and robotic, Rey is a mary sue perfectionist for no reason, she has not earned any of the traits she currently possesses and automatically excels at everything she does, Kylo is a gigantic man child and has no evil appeal to him anymore seeing as he lost to Rey in Episode 7 who has no training whatsoever, Fin had opportunities to develop but it went nowhere, Admiral Gender Wars served no purpose other than to emasculate Poe and conjure up the worst escape plan of all time, and Rose Tico contributed nothing to the story and had a sub plot take up a large chunk of the run time, and that also contributed nothing to the plot.<br/><br/>Old and beloved characters... Luke is the complete opposite of what made him one of the most beloved film characters of all time, instead of instilling hope and overcoming the darkness, he wants the jedi to end and be left to die after contemplating the murder of his own nephew?!? What?!?! Leia, also a beloved character from the original, is a shell of herself and floated out into the vacuum of space without dying and force-flew (breaking narratives) back into the ship?!? Again, What?!?! Carrie Fisher, tragically passed away during the filming of the movie, and you could not even send her out with an ending she deserved... Rest in peace Carrie. Chewbacca, just eats the toys Disney wants you to buy... Admiral Ackbar just goes away, hard to remember his role in the movie because it was non-existent. Leave puppet Yoda alone please.<br/><br/>Story:<br/><br/>Rian Johnson singled handedly destroyed any potential plot points that JJ Abrams set up in the first movie and created several lore breaking moments within this movie, bravo. Hyper speed suicide bombing, WW2 style bomb droppings in the gravity of space, force flying back into a ship through a broken airlock without compromising pressure whatsoever... Just a few errors, many in depth reviews on YouTube go more into depth than I ever could. In short, the story is awful, good luck with Episode 9 JJ, you have nothing to work with...<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Attacking the passionate fans that support your series to the death was the final straw for me, I do not even consider myself a hardcore fan, but seeing them get attacked by the directors/producers for voicing their opinions is absolutely immature and is appalling to see. The best thing that could happen to Star Wars is to remove everyone on the project and rebooting for 10, 11, 12, if it is not too late already. Kathleen Kennedy needs to go, and while I will acknowledge that here are "passionate fans" saying horrible things to Disney, they should know best about vocal minorities, there is simply no excuse for this behaviour. This movie is now a 1 out of 10 for me because the cinematographers and graphic designers did a phenomenal job. Rest in peace Star Wars & Luke Skywalker...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

First I would like to talk about the good things that were done.  Good<br/>#1: The characters.  Never before have I seen this level of depth in characters in a movie. We get to see Ray go through rigorous training with our beloved hero Luke Skywalker. We get to see her struggle...her failures...and her growth in the force.  We finally see why she had visions when she touched Luke's lightsaber.  Or why she was wearing a gold leader helmet in the force awakens. Or where she came from.  And she is a very compelling character thanks to Rian Johnson's writing, even if these things wouldn't have happened.<br/><br/>Kylo Ren finally receives his training from Snoke.  Again we see his struggle and growth as a character while he undergoes rigorous training from his master. And i love the "I have to kill my parents" aspect of his character. Very dark!  I am so glad that he took his helmet off and broke it btw because his character is much more compelling without it on.  I was sick of the mystery and fear that his helmet was providing us as an audience.  Now i can really relate to him!<br/><br/>Poe, Finn, Rose, Purple hair lady...wow.  Not only am I glad they chose to introduce such new and engaging characters to the franchise, I am also glad that they were so pivotal to the story.  Without them...The Last Jedi would have surely failed. Luke and Leia:  They were great.  Got to see Leia's new force powers which were awesome!  She is truly one with the force.  And Luke really showed off his teaching ability while smacking Ray on the hand with grass.  I would have never thought of that technique.  But it clearly worked, because she really seems to know what she is doing!  And stop hating on Luke cause he almost killed his nephew.  Stop!  He loves him.  And remember in the Return of the Jedi when Luke almost kills Darth Vader?  He stops right when he has the advantage.  Good old Luke back to his old ways!<br/><br/>Ok let's move on to the plot:<br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>...umm...ok well?...where...should i begin...hold on i'm trying to think about the meaningful events that took place in this movie...oh yeah!  Now i remember!<br/><br/>What an amazing chase sequence...I mean...movie!  Wow I was on the edge of my seat the whole time wondering if the First Order would catch the Rebels!  And the casino side story?  Excellent choice.  I learned a lot about animal cruelty and how casino's in space have a wide variety of alien life.  That was awesome!  Ray and Kylo's connection is so amazing and mysterious.  It truly is the backbone of this movie.  Every time they had a connection i was like "wow, this is an important moment."  And i was never let down. Well that covers the main plot elements...<br/><br/>Visual effects/Sound:<br/><br/>Visual effects SUCKED BADLY!!!  Music was TERRIBLE!!! Thank the maker the rest of the movie carried all the weight!<br/><br/>Writing/Dialogue/Pacing:<br/><br/>Perfection.  Rian Johnson really proves his writing skill with The Last Jedi.  He is a genius, and anyone who doesn't respect what he did is clearly not on his level. Nothing seems forced, especially not the comedic elements.  I was laughing my butt off during this movie!  What great timing he has, and comedic wit.  This did not feel like a piece of fan fiction with an expensive price tag.  I never felt like "wow...this part is really...dragging on with nothing to drive the momentum forward...so...why is this happening???"  I never felt like that!  And speaking of momentum...<br/><br/>Momentum into Episode 9:<br/><br/>It's all there!  Thanks Rian Johnson!  I can't wait to see what happens in Episode 9 when...umm...well?...we finally see what happens to...?  I guess i'm looking most forward to the resolution of...actually...wait.  Ok let me start over.  If they don't resolve the conflict between......wow i'm not sure why i'm struggling to put this into words i loved The Last Jedi!  So when Finn...uhh...actually Poe.  When Poe finally...yeah...I must be drawing a blank here.  Ok when Ray and Kylo finally kiss that will be awesome!  And when Luke...oh he died...but Leia!  Yes when Leia...is also dead...whoops.  Oh boy.  I must look like an idiot writing this.  Snoke!  Oh my gosh when Snoke finally reveals who...he...is dead too...<br/><br/>Well i still can't wait for episode 9!  Which should take place three days after episode 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

What was wrong with honoring the direction and legends it started?! All this movie does is crucify a heroic character we all loved from childhood, and then leaves us completely unsatisfied with Rey's storyline.

The visuals and effects are to notch, as one would expect from a Star Wars film. But that's where the positive ends. The film commits so many atrocities on the story threads and characters that were established in The Force Awakens, that I no longer care about any of the new characters. Opportunity to build on fan favourites Snoke and Phasma were completely thrown away. The plot opportunity of turning Rey to the darkside was missed - how much cooler would that have been. Leia was grossly underused in what would sadly be Carrie Fisher's last Star Wars film, giving way to flat characters with cringeworthy interactions, eg Finn and Rose (with their pointless ventures on Canto Bight) and Poe and Holdo (seriously, the Leia from the original trilogy was a far better example of an empowered female character than the "I have a plan" Holdo). There are other weird choices like the WW2 inspired bombers and world-altering ideas like hyperspace jump abuse. But the worst irreversible offense that this film commits is against the character of Luke Skywalker. I thought Han Solo's treatment in Force Awakens was disappointing, but wow, what a sad treatment of one of the greatest most positive characters in Star Wars. I felt really sorry for Mark Hamill. I don't know how they can recover Episode IX from this garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is not only a really terrible sw movie (they take a **** on the lore and The Last Jedi does not feel like sw movie at all) but it is genuinely a really terrible movie in general (as a craft in the least). I am very distrustful of "critics" since The Force Awakens reviews. And now it is beyond obvious - critics are either dishonest and bought, scared and self-censored or just plainly incompetent and stupid.<br/><br/>I don't need to spoiler here anything and write what wrote dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of people before me - check youtube channels, google the "what is wrong with the last jedi" or...just use your OWN brain when you watch it. It is not a "toxic" fandom, nazis, fascists, alt-right, manbabies, misogynists or whatnot (as the media and Disney call us) - this movie is simply dumb. The plot is dumber and worse than the screenplay for the remake of Ninja Turtles or Power Rangers - seriously..it is that bad, nonsensical, filled with plot holes, filler side quest with a null outcome and consequence (30+ minutes of scenes which could be cut from the movie and it would steal absolutely nothing from the "story"), lore/world breaking stuff (how they let this happen?), abundance of so called "twists", really BAD and inappropriate humor and once again to emphasise: plot holes, plot armors and deus ex machina everywhere (people getting from point A to point B even when the enemy is everywhere and pointing guns at them with magic I guess)... On top of that there is criminally mistreated character of Luke Skywalker...just god awful treatment.<br/><br/>There is so much wrong with this excuse for a movie so that there are hours of rants on the internet...go and look. The movie is long (nothing is happening there for almost 3 hours!), feels empty, it's boring, the antagonists are complete jokes - literally (mama jokes, prank "phone" calls...). And the protagonists are either dumb, they are acting irrationally to serve a "plot" or inexplicably overpowered and plain. No character development, no struggle especially for Rey - Yes, she proved herself as a textbook example of Mary Sue yet again... Story is sooo lame and stupid that a twelve year old boy/girl could think it of on his/her way to the school.... And you can hate Jar Jar or George Lucas for the prequels but those movies had the beginning, a middle and the end (each of them) and they had an overall arc. George's movies are an example of a consistent and meaningful storytelling. And most importantly they built and extended the sw universe - they give the viewer a feeling that the story is happening in a big galaxy with a bunch of planets and worlds... I was thrilled to read at night the wookiepedia, the books and play the games in that wonderful world George and others created: Thrawn saga, Jedi Outcast, Academy, Kotor 1-2, Force Unleashed...<br/><br/>That all is gone now - Disney killed it and cooked a cheap and dumb movie with Star Wars logo to make money but without any Star Wars ingredients. I did not like VII (basically lot of similar problems and complete rehash of IV - again, go and search internet what is wrong with this one if you need someone to pinpoint it for you) but I went to the cinema after the horrible VII to see episode VIII for the one and only reason they left me - I went to see VIII only for Luke Skywalker, I wanted at least this fan service...I wanted the Jedi Master which he should be...but we've got a clown, a joke of the character instead... This trilogy lacks the SW soul.<br/><br/>You think I am a butt-hurt manbaby (the insult J. Abrams or Rian Johnson calls the fans?) - then why is the director Rian Johnson every day on twitter posting stupidity and trying to defend his creation?? Because he, lucasfilm and disney sees the huge hate but not from some few weirdos like media tries to sell - but from across the fandom and the audience. He tries to blame everything and everyone (even gamergate omg) but himself. Go and laugh at his twitter account... That guy is PATHETIC.<br/><br/>I am not seeing the episode IX. There is nothing to bring me to the cinema for the next episode - it is not just some "childish" boycott - I am just genuinely not interested how this trilogy ends.<br/><br/>P.S. And thanks to the bad taste they left in my mouth I am skipping any other SW movie from their social-justice labs. If they want to push agendas - let them embed it in a good movie at least... The leftist propaganda is too forced and off putting. Movies like SW is a form of escapism...they just tainted it.<br/><br/>P.P.S. To Disney: Solo flopped and you may try to fix this disaster but you cannot undone this money-grab. When you try to reboot this mess I have an advice for you: hire some REAL storyteller who has some talent and will invest at least one afternoon for the screenplay. He should be a real fan with a good taste and respect to the established lore - for now just let this garbage die and be forgotten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie shows that it was newly directed and rewritten, characters have been recreated to fill a another roll to make small attack on crowds of people and force political views that are not needed. And to make Luke Skywalker character look so small and powerless makes the movie unbelievable. True Star Wars fans know who Skywalker is and to see him give up is unreal. Unfortunately this movie will go down as the worst Star Wars movie in history with its broken story and sad character development. Luke would be honored to train a worthy apprentice like Rey so to think that he would just ignore her and drink green space milk while the galaxy is under attack by the darkside is ridiculous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I liked Force Awakens maybe it had similarities with New Hope but I liked it nevertheless.<br/><br/>So the beginning was good actually the best part of the entire movie. Poes call to Hux was funny I had to admit that I laughed to it. But after that I felt they were trying to make joke at every scene possible. There were many plot twists that were good and unexpected but they also rised a lot of questions, like Snokes dead. Special effects were amazing. All explosions and the battle with those red quard guys looked good.<br/><br/>The best way to express this movie is wtf. It had so many weird and bizarre moments. Finns and the god-knows-who-little-asian-kids side adventure in the casino planet was boring and stupid. Also the rebel ship had 18 hours to fuel so the First Orders plan is to keep shooting at them. Why didn't they just board it? And what the actual **** was Leia flying in space? Care to explain??? Ok no. How can anyone track someone in lightspeed? Seriously how? "Oh you know they have this thing in their ship so we need to call to this random old lady who tells us to go to this random planet to find this random guy who does something random." Also when the stormtroopperwannabes showed up they decided to drag them on this huge open area full of them and kill those two as slowly as possible. It was so stupid.<br/><br/>Reys "training" wasn't any better. She just swung lightsaber few times and closed her eyes so now she is supposed to be the greatest jedi ever. Also the fact that Reys parents were nobodies is also really stupid. I mean atleast Anakin was made by midichlorians but Rey is just nobody.<br/><br/>Last battle in the salt planet was also really stupid. They had atleast hundred soldiers there first and then suddenly they had like 10. And the best plan they have is to fly with those old speeders with no cannons. And it's actually reaaaaaaaaaalllly great coincidense that out of 13 speeders the 3 that survive are the ones with the most important characters + that one kid. If Finn would have died it actually would have been lot better. But again we have this annoying kid who no one cares about. And the worst part was that she didn't even die. No one ever asked for stupid love triangle with Finn that kid and Rey. It's so stupid and idiotic. It is supposed to be star wars not twilight. Also the way they found way out from the base was also so stupid. "Yeah there is no way out from here, oh wait there is haha."<br/><br/>Luke surviving the attack was cool and I was sure he was using some badass forceshield or something but no. He is kind of ghost but then he is not ghost. How did he do it and why did he do it and why did he had to die? It's so confusing.<br/><br/>So overall it was decentish movie. But star wars movies aren't supposed to be just ok or not that bad. They are supposed to be the best movies ever made. So maybe Force Awakens and Rogue One weren't as good as earlier films but atleast they were watchable and enjoyable. But anyways Im still watching the next one and Disney gets more money so its win-win.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8499493"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I had had high hopes when I was entering the cinema for Last Jedi. Upon leaving I wasn't disappointed or upset. I just felt really, really sorry for what Disney did to Star Wars. The Last Jedi fails both as an individual movie and, even more so, as part of a series and is one of the worst films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>First and foremost it seems that the screenplay was written by somebody who was unhappy to make a movie which is the middle part of a trilogy. This is kind of understandable: second movie out of three means that your film will neither have a real beginning because it picks up, where the first movie ended, nor an ending, because it is a lead up to the third film. JJ Abrams built up a lot of potential, shrouding important pieces of the plot in mystery: Who is Snoke? How did he become the leader of what essentially is the ne Empire? Who is Rey? Where do her powers come from? Who were her parents? How do those characters tie in into the "Skywalker Saga"? Rian Johnson decided to set all those carefully constructed pieces of the plot on fire and throw them out of the window into a dumpster. Snoke? Random guy, dies a random death, so who cares who he had been. Rey? Well, she's just a random Mary Sue. Skywalker? Johnson seems to hate him.<br/>Luke Skywalker's return was the very dramatic peak of Force Awakens, the entire plot of the first movie was building up all the tension to leave the audience with a cliff hanger, for finally, old Master Skywalker was found and the new main protagonist gave him his old light sabre back. What happens in Last Jedi? Luke throws the lightsabre away, in a manner which brings to mind the cartoon Coyote rummaging through the contents of his ACME toolbox. Funny? I think not. What's more, Luke's new personna doesn't seem to have anything to do with the old Luke Skywalker we'd known. And sure, people change. But considering that half the audience was eagerly awaiting the return of their old hero, turning a character, who literally is a pop culture icon, into a clown seems thoughtless.<br/>Unfortunately, such thoughlessness accompanies the events on e screen all the time - tearing down any respect we used to have to both the protagonists and antagonists in a failed effort to make the movie a Marvel-like goofy comedy. Where Marvel managed to make us both laugh at the antics of the superheroes and supervillains and at the same time like them Rian Johnson failed, and left the onscreen characters looking like unlikable idiots. And just like The Force Awakens was a build up for the rest of the trilogy, how are we supposed to care about what is to happen in the third movie? The only previously interesting villain, Snoke, is dead. General Hux and Kylo Ren are idiots and aren't scary at all. Same with protagonists. Rey is a Mary Sue, she wins at everything and is therefore boring. Same thing with Finn, who is only there to kick Phasma's arse time and again. Poe is an idiot. Carrie Fisher is dead. Mark Hamill is alive but his character is dead. So why care what happens to them in the next movie? To be honest it's perplexing how Johnson didn't plan ahead for the third installment in his own excuse of a movie.<br/>What is more, such lack of planning is the movie's biggest fault not only when you consider it as a part of a longer series, but also as its' own film. Even if you look at the film without the context of the ongoing plots, it is a mess. The whole plot with Finn and Rose travelling to collect an idiotic McGuffin from Random Place of Danger is totally irrelevant to the rest of the plot, its' outcome is null but takes half an hour of the onscreen action. The main villain dies randomly halfway into the episode. Luke Skywalker does all kind of random stuff and then all of a sudden he dies for no obvious reason. Johnson seems not to have had any idea for a plot but instead just filled the entire screentime with his stream of consciousness, improvising on the way.<br/>And if this wasn't bad enough, there's this one scene which goes completely against Star Wars canon. Those of you who are only reading this to fuel your own rage at Johnson's inaptitude know what I am about to write about. Faster than light travel. In one scene trumping all the previous idioticisms general Holdo rams her ship into the fleet of the First Order, destroying the flag ship. If you can do that, why hadn't they just light jumped a few ships into the previous Deathstars and Starkillers? It would have been a cheap, easy, instawin solution. In the next movies, when Resistance are trying to destroy the nextgen Death Stars I expect them to do just that. Get a ship and Press the Win Button!<br/><br/>I could continue about other faults of the movie, but since I'm about to reach the 5000 sign cap, and I wouldn't do all this onscreen stupidity justice anyway, I'll just write that I've only covered most of the most ridiculous crap and left out the so much more that there is in the film. Congratulations Disney, 0/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8499160"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">First of all, I'm glad that the story isn't a rip-off from Episode 5. After watching Episode 7, I thought Episode 8 would have a lot of similarities with Episode 5. I became more confident with my assumption after watching the last trailer when there was a scene of Walkers on a white surface (which I thought would be a copy of the Hoth Battle in Episode 5.). On the opening crawl of the movie, it says the Ressistance were being invaded by the First Order, which I thought is a sign that the movie would be like Episode 5 when the Rebel base was invaded by the Empire.<br/><br/>It turned out, the story is almost completely different from Episode 5 and I was so glad it wasn’t a rip-off like Episode 7. They have brought something totally fresh and new to the Star Wars franchise. It’s filled with complexity, character transformations, and a lot of plot twists.<br/><br/>Speaking of plot twist, there’s a hell lot of them. For instance, I didn’t expect Snoke to be killed so early. I thought he would survive until the last movie (Episode 9). I was also really surprised that Rey’s parents turned out to be ordinary people. No one ever thought of that ! I love how Kylo and Luke told the same story about the murder attempt in different perspectives. There’s a bit of noir element in the story.<br/><br/>I find the directing and writing style to be rather childish. Lots of camera zoom-ins, lots of comical jokes (which is not my type of humor), lots of parodies. I would say it’s made to be enjoyable for young kids, more so than the other Star Wars movies.<br/><br/>Some scenes and features are quite unnecessary for the plot. For instance, the story could’ve carried on the same way without having the casino scene. I also think a lot of the things are too overdone and some are obviously made to please the fans. Leia flying in space is too excessive and it makes force-users seem less exclusive. The part when Walkers were attacking Luke's hologram is too childish and it makes me question Johnson's maturity. And why did Luke suddenly died for no reason ? It doesn't make sense. Spirit Yoda summoning lightning is just too much for me to handle.<br/><br/>The characters are made sillier and more naive in this movie. For instance, after Luke was watching a nostalgic holographic video of Leia asking for help, he decided to change his mind immediately. It's amazing how a single nostalgic moment can radically change his decision. The part when was Snoke teasing Kylo constantly is also very childish.<br/><br/>Another complain that I have is the design. For instance, Snoke's room is too bright and cheerful-looking instead of dark and gloomy like what villain lairs should look like. I also don't like how Snoke was wearing a golden-colored clothes instead of black like in Episode 7. Some clothes in the casino planet look too much like in real life for a Star Wars movie.  Overall, there are a lot of things to love and hate about this movie. I love the acting performance, the plot twists, the cinematography, and its innovation. On the other hand, it's filled with too much fan service, has some useless characters and plots (if not, annoying), and the directing/writing style is too naive for me to handle. I also think the movie could've been a lot better with shorter duration, especially with the absence of casino scenes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They even use the same setting in one of the scenes.  They substituted settings for other scenes.  I also don't like how the characters can use the force by projecting themselves to a different location.  We never saw this in previous films and it would have solved a lot of problems in those films.  Also, Rey became a Jedi Master with hardly any training.  On the plus side, the acting and special effects were good throughout.  I wish there was some originality but the writers seem to be out of ideas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I avoided all spoilers and went to screening just a few days after it was released.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite trying to remain positive throughout the viewing, ultimately I was left hugely disappointed. For me the movie was totally superficial. A good looking movie that  lacked any real soul or depth in either the story or the characters. That was the real problem for me, Star Wars or any good movie has always been character driven for me. I feel a connection to the characteristics and become invested in their story. The Last Jedi had the opposite affect on me. Characters that I had been interested in like Rey, Finn and Poe and even long time favourites like Luke Skywalker came across as quite plastic and to be honest almost unlikeable. By halfway through the movie their story had little suspense because I no longer cared what happened to the characters.<br/><br/>After watching the movie I was quite interested in others opinions and was quite surprised by the positive reviews that it received from critics. Especially reviews that praised it for it’s originality and for taking chances. I know it tried to shock at different stages but it came across as being cheap and gimmicky rather than anything of real substance. In fact I wished that they had followed through with some of these scenes. They could have made some of these characters more compelling maybe even making Kylo Ren a formidable villain.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was just disappointing or as some of my friends put it a ‘lemon’. i do realise that half the viewing population loved the movie and to those people more power to you in fact I feel a bit jealous because I wished that I enjoyed it as well but I can’t recommend this movie as anything more than a B movie time filler.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I had to google an explanation for the end of the movie because it makes so little sense. Characters do totally irrational things and whole plot threads have no reason for events or character behavior. I left the theater not knowing who was alive and who was dead because it was so ambiguous and without logic. This movie is worse than the prequel trilogy. There is a light saber duel in the middle of the movie that is OK, although it is over-choreographed and some actors miss their mark, making it look like a silly dance in places. I don't think they can undo the harm in the next sequel, I wish they could retract the film and make it again properly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8496537"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The movie was OK but way too long (it's more a 5.5 for me) ! The whole "casino planet" scene should have been cut It just didn't bring anything to the story. Ask yourself: if the scene wasn't in the movie, will it change the story ? The answer is no. I think that scene was made only to plug Benicio del Toro character in the movie because the studio said: - Guys, we have Benicio del Toro for the next Star Wars movie you have to find a way to put him in the movie.<br/>- But he's irrelevant to the plot.<br/>- Don't care ! We have Benicio del effing Toro for Star Wars find a way !<br/>So they create the whole casino mission for that purpose... at least, that's how it felt since this whole part of the movie is completely meaningless. Then there's Rose... wow. She just need to go for the next movie, like kill or severely injured her in a battle after the opening credits so she won't be able to intervene in anyway, whatsoever, in the story. Just felt like they forced the character on the public and it didn't connect. Ok, now there's those little hamster-owl thingies... obviously a cash grab for movie merchandise. Again, they didn't bring ANYTHING to the movie, the only serve as a marketing tool for their plush toys. I see you coming: but they were Ewoks, rancor monster or wampas in other Star Wars movies, but they served a purpose to the story: Ewoks played a key role in the battle of Endor, the rancor led to the Sarlacc pit battle where the gang is reunited and Luke use his force power for the first time in the wampa cave and encountered Obi-Wan ghost outside.<br/>I won't give a failing mark for the Last Jedi it's still an ok movie. Remove Rose and the Casino planet subplot and I'll give it a 8 easily. Rey and Kylo teaming up against Snoke Preatorian guards is awesome, Luke's final battle, the questioning around the role of Jedi and the debate surrounding them etc. Excellent musical score, like always and great visual effects to support the Star Wars universe. I have a question though: what the hell happened to the Y-Wing bombers ? I think they would have made a better job than the extremely slow and shieldless bombers (whose gunners are quite incompetent from what I saw) from that movie don't you think ? Anyway, the Last Jedi is far from being a great Star Wars movie. Let's hope Disney learned from those mistakes for Episode IX, because the Star Wars universe deserve way better and has a lot more potential than that.<br/><br/>PS: English is a second language to me, so they might be a lot of typos in that review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8495248"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Pros: The CGI was great.<br/><br/>Cons: Here's a list of major plotholes.    The Empire has been fighting the Rebels/Resistance for 40 years now and 3 capital ships (one of which is the Emperor's flagship) are completely and utterly defenseless against a single X-Wing?? The Supremacy, the largest ship in the First Order, and the one containing the Emperor, can't take care of one single X-Wing? Why doesn't the Resistance just send 30 X-Wings to take down all 3 capital ships then?    It takes under 5 minutes for this one X-Wing to destroy all the cannons on the surface of one of the Dreadnoughts. Somehow, the shields and armor of the Empire's capital ships are totally torn apart by one lone, tiny, single-pilot fighter, even though the giant cannons on the Dreadnoughts are unable to pierce the shield on the Raddus. Why exactly does the Empire build these ships?    Why does Holdo stay on the Raddus? The plan was to evacuate everyone on the transport ships while the Raddus continued it's course in order to distract the Imperial fleet. Why does she have to stay on the ship just for it to continue flying the same direction at the same speed? At this point, it was unknown to them that DJ would betray them, so there was no reason for a pilot to stay on the Raddus. Also, why does the person staying on the ship need to be a senator and the acting-admiral of the fleet, as well as one of Leia's oldest and most trusted friends? You couldn't put a droid on there? Or anyone else?    Two torpedoes with explosive payloads go off right next to Leia. She survives the flames, the shockwave, and the (millions of pieces of) shrapnel. She gets knocked unconscious in the vacuum of space, but manages to hold the oxygen in her lungs and survives depressurization and freezing. And when she flies back to the ship, they open a door to the vacuum of space on a moving ship without any sort of depressurization or suction at all. What? This is B-movie level bad.    Finn and Rose took an escape pod from the Raddus to the casino and back. If the escape pods are equipped with hyperdrives, then why don't they use them to escape instead of the transport ships?    The hyperdrive weaponization. There's about a million posts on this so I won't go into it.    How does Rey know how to use a lightsaber and force powers? How can she stand toe-to-toe against Royal Guards? She has had zero combat training whatsoever, and next to no force training.    Rose's sister gives her life for the Resistance. She uses a stun-baton on her personal hero because he was trying to abandon ship. She goes on what is most likely an insane suicide mission for a chance to let the Resistance fleet get away. She gives up the one possession she has left over from her family (her necklace) to complete the mission. Why, then, does she risk the lives of literally everyone remaining in the Resistance in a last-ditch desperate attempt to save Finn from giving his life to stop the cannon? The cannon that's about to destroy the last line of defense that the Resistance has. This makes no sense for her character. After she rams Finn's ship, why do the advancing AT-ATs completely ignore them? They are literally right in front of the AT-AT line. How are they able to cover all that distance back to the base without being shot or captured?    Why are the FO capital ships unable to see or fire upon the transports before DJ tells them? If they were cloaked, how are they suddenly able to see them once they know about the plan? Why do they not chase them down with TIE fighters since they know that the ship containing all the Resistance's fighter ships is now empty?    There is a period of time when Kylo Ren is unconscious and Rey takes Snoke's escape pod to leave. Why does she not kill Kylo, the (now) most evil person in the universe, the one who killed Han, the commander of the Supremacy, and the Emperor of the First Order? She could nearly end the war right there!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I've played the games, collected the comic books and read about a dozen of the novels.  I've got about $300 worth of Star Wars: Armada ships in my book case and even though EP1 and EP2 were not stellar (they were good though..), EP3 was amazing.  I listen to the sound tracks and when I ran a marathon years ago, I listened to the "Throne Room" track when I crossed the finish line.  I've built models as a child of X-Wings and other ships, I've bought easily $1000 worth of Star Wars legos and sent them to my nephews.  I've seen the Clone Wars cartoon series all the way through twice and I'll probably watch it again someday.  My youth, my imagination, my heart all belonged to Star Wars.<br/><br/>Not anymore.  I never will watch Episode VII or VIII again.  Horrible garbage that craps on all the lore of the past, changes all the characters and story for the worst and has killed any interest I have in Star Wars ever again.  I didn't see Solo and I will not be seeing Episode 9.  Star Wars is dead to me.  It's a liberal crap fest of silly men and purple haired over arching women.  The men are all stupid and the women all are just so smart.  The force is silly and the Jedi are meaningless.  I didn't care if any of them lived or died.  I'm still not even sure what happened in this movie or why I should care.  The magic is gone, Star Wars is dead.  I wish these movies were never made (Rogue One was ok, but not worth the crap that is 7 and 8).  I will watch the original 6 until I die, and just pretend Disney never got involved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Except for the original trilogy, I'm done with it.  I guess if you could separate this from the rest of the Star Wars movies then this would be watchable but for those of us who have been in love with Star Wars since the first movie, this movie is an abomination.  How does Rey know the force so well?  How can you destroy a whole fleet of ships with warp drive?  What point was there to the Asian and purple haired woman?  Why didn't she just tell them their plan instead causes a mutiny? Why is Luke portrayed as such a defeated man? Isn't he supposed to be a Jedi?  Who is Snoke?  How did the defeated empire build a planet sized death-star? Why didn't Luke just fly to the battle instead of committing force suicide?  None of this adds up.  Whoever wrote and directed this pile of crap should be ashamed.  The only thing that could possibly fix this is to take the movie back and start over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are always differences of opinion depending on what you want out of a movie, but watching people write about how they convinced themselves this movie succeeded in any way has been outside the normal range. It’s a little bizarre honestly, and fairly excruciating to listen to the phrases being turned to try to explain how this film wasn’t a failure. It wasn’t even impressively bad, it’s just boring and mediocre and uncomfortable. Be honest people, this doesn’t “turn the franchise on its head” or any other stupid euphemism, it’s an insecure and cynical mess that confuses self-ridicule with innovation and tries to be non-formulaic by setting up suggestive premises and then going nowhere with them. It’s like the creators are constantly daring the audience to care about where things are going and seeing how many times they can make you think this movie will eventually go anywhere before you just give up and start zoning out on special FX. Even the parts that deserve some appreciation don’t work well. The sequence on the Las Vegas-style resort world, notwithstanding that it’s completely superfluous to the plot, points out that many people are profiting from the war by selling arms to both sides. I appreciate that the story went out of its way to make that point, but if you are going to use fantasy to provide insight into reality, don’t do it by trying to out-realize reality. If I want to see war profiteering, I’ll just watch the news. This would not have been a hard movie to get right, but instead of the characters evolving naturally they just get repeatedly slammed through these disjointed scenarios ostensibly written to convince you that this isn’t “the same old Star Wars”. I was not a big Force Awakens fan and I don’t want the same old Star Wars, but this movie feels like being in a room full of friends that have lost interest in each other and are killing time by self-consciously making fun of themselves for trying too hard. The prequel trilogy was amateurish, but at least it had a plot and believed in where it was going. This movie might be the biggest flop of the bunch. Hey, sometimes your college try just doesn’t land and you get a real stinker. Life goes on, just stop with this weird insistence that this movie somehow accomplished anything beyond set design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It has all the elements I've ever wanted out of a Star Wars movie - lightsaber duels, implausible space combat that seems more like something out of WWII, and the fight between the sides of the light and the dark, within us and without.<br/><br/>I was pleased with Rey's development as a character, pushing for new ground rather than rehashing old tropes or providing fan service, and appreciated that they still managed to get nods in to previous episodes. The same kinds of journeys are happening, but the paths are different, the choices made vary, and the results lead in new directions.<br/><br/>There are some pacing problems - the Canto Bight casino scene needed to be a little more heavy handed, I think, to get people to understand the reason for it, but the payoff in the end helps to mitigate that to some degree. The humor felt too modern in many places, especially right at the start, and that distracted me from it being long ago and far away.<br/><br/>It was most assuredly an action adventure, and still aimed fairly young, as Star Wars has always done. There are some simple morals to the story as well, but instead of the prior episodes where those were fairly black and white, this time there was some nuance in play, a little more acceptance of things varying depending on your point of view. That made it feel a little more grown up, and like it was taking its young audience seriously.<br/><br/>Enough calls back to prior episodes and returning characters to make an old fan happy, enough surprises in the storyline to keep you from knowing what would happen except in the broadest of strokes, and a wealth of characters changing and evolving and becoming more real and believable along the way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Please don't hand your next flagship star wars film over to someone who's never made a big fun action movie before.  Rian Johnson IS a good director, but the dude can't write star wars for beans.  It's strange how much flack Lord and Miller got for not sticking to the story when making Solo, yet Johnson got to just do whatever with their biggest movie.  It's good to not stick too closely to the lore or try doing something new, but this is star wars not an arthouse film.  TFA was exciting, fun, and genuinely likeable.  Rey and Finn had SO much foreshadowing for this film, but all of it was for nothing.  Finn was all bluffing and funny in the last movie, here he just... gets called out for being a coward by Rose, and you think there's going to be some funny chemistry there (like he had with Rey) but nope. This whole storyline was pointless and poorly thought out.  Leia, Laura Dern and Po have an even more muddled, confusing storyline that goes nowhere, also. Generally every time it's not Luke/Rey/Kylo ren, you can switch off your brain, it's a dumb sidequest.  And then you think something crazy and different is going to happen with the Jedi half of the film (that is much stronger)... but ultimately, nothing changes, and it's all for nothing, depsite all the set-up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There is a lot going on and the film tries to deliver the survival of the Rebellion in a way that is interesting end provocative. It almost works but the problems lie in the provocation from The Last Jedi and how it tried to force (no pun intended) select ideals on its audience. Take, for instance, the heavy-handed feminine heroism pushed throughout. Hardly any leaders of the Rebellion are men. Heck, the few that exist are mostly eradicated in the early, leaving Poe and Luke Skywalker as perhaps the only true male leads that matter in Star Wars. That would be fine if the female leads took control and made me believe that the Rebellion is in good hands but it takes over 2 hours for me to finally feel any semblance of certainty and that's only when Rey and Poe appear to take the reins of the whole operation. Vice Admiral Holdo was a great, albeit small character to showcase female heroics but when Disney tried to force Rose and Leia as important characters going forward, it made it hard to love The Last Jedi. Afterall, the name of the movie highly suggests that this movie is very much about Luke Skywalker and yet his presence in this movie almost feels secondary to all that's happening. That brings me back to my original point: so much is happening in this movie that it can be tough for an audience to focus on the big picture. My first viewing I found myself constantly battling the somewhat schizophrenic scene jumps between Skywalker, the Rebellion survival, FN and Rose's shenanigans, and the building interest of Kylo Ren and what his view is of the future for the First Order. Speaking of the First Order - who the hell was Snoke? There was a ton of intrigue that was nearly thrown away in this movie. The curious draw of Kylo and Rey was awesome and could have lead to an interesting future for Star Wars - a path that no other film has taken and could have at least offered a snippet of unexpected behavior for a franchise that has stuck to a formula since the succession of the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Given that this is Disney, and Disney doesn't always do best in adult-targeted films, they should have left the experiments (like the pointless casino plotline which wastes the audience time, especially given the result) to the spinoff films. Rogue One was EXCELLENT and I had the utmost confidence that Disney may have figured out what a good Star Wars movie could be and give it new life to rival the original trilogy. Alas, we're still hoping. The good news is that J.J. Abrams is back for the 9th film (helped on The Force Awakens, also does the modern Star Trek movies) and given his reactions to The Last Jedi I feel a bit more confident that the final installment of this current trilogy holds better moments and more cohesion. Abrams, like many, didn't care for the way Luke was sent off, the holding of Leia in the films (especially given the fact that many knew her health was of concern and the series needed to let her go in the right way), and more with The Last Jedi and I think that lessons can be learned and bring forth a better Star Wars in terms of the main storyline of the fight between the Resistance/Rebellion and the Empire/First Order.<br/><br/>TLDR? If there's one thing I wasn't pleased with regarding The Last Jedi, it was the inferior storytelling. Too much jumping around and odd character choices with the progression of those characters taking seemingly-bad turns. It's like Disney knew they had a great movie and decided to throw some wrenches into the mix. It doesn't kill the movie but it knocks it down a couple points and that's too bad - The Last Jedi definitely could have been the best movie of the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If this had been a standalone release of "Generic hero has space fun", it might have been ok, but as is, it thoughtlessly destroys too much in terms if hopes and dreams.<br/><br/>The actual bad:<br/>* physics, engineering, strategy and tactics get very little respect (bomb dropping in space, vacuums not sucking out air, outrunning explosions, planets are more like suburbs, the usual space noise, dragging canons around and very story-telling motivated shooting)<br/>* the whole casino subplot makes little sense and would have better been removed<br/>* one very cringy not-quite sacrifice scene that's completely unnecessary from beginning to end<br/>* overall specific personages are considered way too important, as opposed to circumstances (you have to talk with just this one person so that they can point you to that one person in the universe who could do a specific thing and fetch them, well, here we are with a handful of people left and that'll make all the difference to ... a galaxy)<br/>* the force is now something that doesn't require any training but just is inate<br/>* the first order is militarily pretty laughable, as just one guy in a crappy old fighter can hold off an entire fleet of dreadnoughts, and they can't possibly think of using their fuel advantage to jump ahead and exhaust their opponent, or maybe use those fighters - if you make your villains laughable, it invalidates the heroes<br/><br/>The good:<br/>* some genuine surprises<br/>* some amusing and well written humour ("The force!")<br/>* great photography and score<br/>* awesome acting by Hamill and Driver<br/>* great job on having significant numbers of women in very visible roles making actual decisions<br/>* good casting of real faces (as opposed to extreme beauty)<br/>* franchise tie in animals aren't cringy<br/><br/>Advice to disney:<br/>* make sure your writing teams include people who ask critical questions and use the to eliminate senseless parts of the plot<br/>* reboot the franchise completely with the next movie, maybe explore some of the rich background material that is part of the star wars canon.

It completely takes the concepts and plot points originally set up in the first movie and just chucks them over their shoulder. Seriously, the result of Rey holding out the light saber to Luke ends in him just chucking it away. Where to start with this steaming pile of shiet. First, Rey is apparently nobody special. Her parents were junkers who traded her for credits then drank themselves to death and are buried on Jakku in a poppers grave. Snoke is nobody special as he is easily killed by Ben Solo aka Kylo Ren. These are two things that are set up to be major plot points in the first movie that are just chucked out the window in this new movie. The whole point of the movie is killing the past and letting go of your heroes so that "new ones" can rise. **** garbage. This is just an excuse for lazy writing and a very clear "progressive" agenda. There's the scene on the Resistance capital ship where the new admiral doesn't tell Poe her plan which results in him mutinying and setting up a plan of his own that fails because Fin and his new love interest Rose (who is beautiful by feminist standards), are completely inept. Why didn't the femnazi purple haired admiral just tell Poe her plan? I mean if you are planning to stealthily abandon ship and flee to an old uncharted Rebellion base, maybe that's the kind of thing you would want to tell the crew? So that, you know, they can prepare to abandon ship? Anyway, Fin and Rose go to the casino world, complain about capitalism, get arrested, break out, free some animals but not the slave children (Like WTF! you free the freaking animals but not the SLAVE KIDS!!!), partner up with a criminal they met in prison who later betrays them (big freaking surprise). . . Absolute trash. Next up is Fin trying to nobly sacrifice his life to save the resistance only to have his life saved by the ugly chick who wants his D. What could have been a great moment about sacrifice and real heroes ends with a horrible progressive sjw bullshiet speech about how heroes are bullshiet (WTAF). Next is Rey. OMG every scene with her and Luke was cringy AF! Luke drinks green udder milk that he squeezes fresh from some kind of ugly sea cow and complains constantly. We also finally find out what happened to the new jedi order Luke tried to establish. Apparently Luke felt a darkness growing in Ben, and decided to sneak into his room late at night to try and KILL HIS NEPHEW because he was afraid that Ben would turn dark. Surprise surprise, Ben didn't react well to that, bringing the building down on them, knocking Luke unconscious, and then Ben proceeds to turn to the dark side and kill or turn the new jedi order. I mean, Luke, the guy who was willing sacrificed himself to the emperors force lightening because he had so much faith in the sliver of light in his father, Darth Vader, the most evil bad guy ever, suddenly decides to lose all faith and try to KILL HIS NEPHEW at the slightest sign of darkness? WTF! Then there was a chance for the movie to be redeemed. After Kylo kills Snoke and he and Rey kill the Red Guard together, he reaches out to Rey asking her to join him and rule beside him and she says. . . no. Of course she says no, because this is **** Disney and good guys can never be bad. . . This movie would have instantly been better if Rey had turned dark, ruled beside Kylo, and the third movie was about everyone else dealing with the fall out of that with a Rey redemption arch. Or hell, it would have been more interesting if Rey attacked Kylo for the throne, beat him and it had been Kylo/Ben who turned back to the light, joined the resistance and then had to fight to try and bring Rey back to the light. But no. Instead Kylo stays evil, Rey stays good, and the movie is all the worse off for it. Finally, that light speed crash used to destroy the first orders capital ship was freaking lore braking as all hell. I mean, if all you had to do was light speed crash a capital ship into another one to destroy it, then why didn't the rebellion do that against both death stars? I could go on and on. This movie did have potential coming off the first one, and it literally just flushed it down the toilet. There will be those who will say that this movie is the most philosophical and intellectually deep of any SW movie, and they will be full of shiet. This movie was lazily written and directed. It's clear that they decided to go in a completely different direction from what J.J. Abrams set up and did so in the most disrespectful way. This movie is literally the worst Star Wars movie of all time. No joke. The prequels were better than this, because they at least had a consistent and coherent arch. SWTLJ, has no core story, message, or purpose to even exist in the SW universe at all. It's just characters doing **** that looks cool to set up a new trilogy free from the past and it's fans. I for one am a fan who will never watch another Disney SW movie again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I can't believe these are the best screenwriters and the greatest vision a company like Disney could find.  Like the first movie this is just one action set piece after another stitched together with little regard for story or character.  Another installment of modern Hollywoods lust for mediocrity, jamming undeveloped characters and plot in between glitzy CGI action scenes.  If you asked 100 liberal arts graduates to write a Star Wars trilogy I believe nearly all of them would be better than this bland superficial pile of crap.  In almost every scene I could practically hear some obnoxious salesman writer/director/producer pitch the scene to corporate executives who are barely listening.  This is basically a Star Wars installment of Transformers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Are you feeling the rage boil up inside you until it explodes from your finders in an electrifying tirade of abuse? Well we all know how that is referenced in this film. Rian Johnson has created a visual marvel, an artistic masterpiece with visionary creativIty not seen since Lord of The Rings. The story is action packed, yet riddled with subtle clues that change the way you feel about the black and white nature of the force. Rian was asked to take chances, which he did and everyone has panned him for it. Nearly all decisions taken here make sense. I've had discussions with a friend who didn't like this and he explains that the space battles were pointless, the middle section with Finn was pointless and in the end everyone ends up without any real resolution. I can see his point however, I think this film needs to be seen with the context that it is the middle of a trilogy and is transitional movie. The force awakens left little of me wondering what is next. It re trod so much old ground that I felt like the next step was predictable. I'm now really excited about the next movie as Rian removes the chafe, blurs the lines between light and dark and divides opinion in such a way that speculation for the next movie covers so many more topics that it has to be unpredictable. It's my opinion an I'm entitled to it, but I'm not sure this dark hate and fury from social media is good for arguably one of the most imaginative franchises in history. Maybe next time you will get what you asked for, bland boring and predictable? Maybe mext time I'll be the one spewing hate when Luke is found alive and well, Rey is a princess and phasma wins a fight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Where to even begin..<br/><br/>I'm not about to launch into a scene by scene tirade, as many fans before me have done the same in a much more eloquent fashion, but I will say this: The Last Jedi fails in EVERY aspect of good film-making. It is a beautiful looking, million dollar turd. The plot zig-zags back and forth meaninglessly, the characters, shallow, unrelatable or insane. The **** they do MAKES. NO. SENSE. NOTHING in-universe makes any sense any more. Logic is completely thrown out of the picture. TLJ embraces pure, stupid emotion resulting in:<br/><br/>- A laughing stock of the First Order, completely unintimidating and generally useless villains. Hux somehow hasn't been executed or at the very least relieved for his incompetence and Phasma has zero presence. She has no reason to exist other than to give Finn a shiny glorified punching bag.<br/>- A purple haired lesbian (yes this is part of her character because reasons) admiral who spouts drivel about faith while apparently having no faith in any of her crew to tell them the plan to escape the bad guys, dooming literally all but a small handful of them to a merciless death. She utterly fails as a leader and yet the movie pretends she's the good guy all along by turning her into a kamikaze pilot in perhaps the prettiest yet dumbest scene in all of Star Wars.<br/>- A deranged psychopath that claims fighting what you hate isn't how you win, despite earlier on her own sister doing the EXACT OPPOSITE AND WINNING, while simultaneously watching her hated enemy preparing to kill all her friends. Her enemies can do this as a DIRECT RESULT of her own actions. (How have the rebels not keeled over already with people like her and purple hair in it?! Oh, right. Incompetent villains unless when it's convenient.)<br/>- A menacing, all-powerful antagonist who is actually neither powerful or menacing and dies in the most pathetic way possible while monologuing about how unbeatable he is<br/>- The most uninteresting, aimless and actually all-powerful protagonist who by the word of Yoda has no need for training, trials or tribulations to succeed, she need only exist and her problems will solve themselves<br/>- A broken, dejected cast of old, respected characters who are shown to have lost all hope and just want to die sad and alone after having turned into a complete joke of their former selves. Luke Skywalker, legendary sci-fi hero turned suicidal hermit is probably the worst offender of the bunch. Not even Mark Hamill has any interest in returning for his role after this crap.<br/><br/>The Last Jedi gets one point from me because there is only one thing I liked; Kylo Ren's throne room fight. Yes, the guy who has callously killed untold numbers and his own father is the only one I can root for..incredible. Unfortunately he's the only one who seems to have a pulse in this film. There is nothing else salvageable out of the nuclear crater TLJ left in its wake. In one movie Rian Johnson killed what made Star Wars. How is this possible? From the get-go, this is someone who has been quoted to say he would "be worried if everyone [thought]" the movie he made "was a good movie." He would prefer half the audience hate the movie and the other half love it and he finds this prospect "much more exciting." Despite this, Rian has deflected every piece of negative criticism on his creative 'vision' like he's the Van Gogh of Hollywood. He seriously believes The Last Jedi is excused from any critique...NONE of it is valid according to him. Is his egg-shaped head filled to the brim with that much hubris? He also apparently believes that if Empire Strikes Back came out when social media existed, it would've been roasted to hell and back because Luke Skywalker "..gets his ass handed to him." by Vader. (Only if you made it, Rian..Only if you made it.) Someone with this mindset was given "complete creative control" over the cultural juggernaut sensation that used to be Star Wars. I simply do not understand how Disney could screw up so hard. We fans are not impossible to please; Tickle our fancy right and we'd have dropped hundreds of thousands on you just like we did with George. Instead, Disney and its peons have opted to directly insult their own consumer-base for their failures, pushing for some 'toxic masculinity' or 'anti-feminist' nonsense. REAAAAALLY SMAAAART.<br/><br/>I no longer have hope or an interest for the future of this series. This is the last SW film I'll ever pay to see as long as Kathleen Kennedy is head of Lucasfilm. A colossal waste of talent and potential on all sides. The dream is dead, and it seems like Kylo was right all along. Time to let old things die, isn't it? Kill the past if you have to. (Ridiculous line..) I'll miss what Star Wars used to be but I've no regret over ditching this sad, soulless continuation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

All the elements that were built up in the previous movie were discarded in very unsatisfying manners.  There are several very large plot holes and even little actions throughout the movie have terrible motivation--even the basic science of the universe is discarded.  On the plus side, the actors playing Rey and Kylo continue to show that they are phenomenal actors and they actually have some interesting interactions in this show.  That's the part everyone likes.  But the movie overall was so destructive we would be better of if it had not been created because it changes the universe to make existing movies worse.  I'd say it's as bad as or worse than the prequels in that regard.<br/><br/>Score: awful.  Not only is it not a good movie, it actively makes our world worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The character development was good and we actually cared about those characters. In extension, we came to care about R2-D2 and 3-CPO because of the excellent interaction they had with the other human characters. We cared about Chewbacca because of his interaction with Han. These were all characters that meant something to the viewer. This bond happened quickly, strongly, and stayed strong throughout the entire three episodes. Obe-Wan Kenobe and Yoda were mysterious, mystic, powerful characters that we yearned to know more about. They became more important as they interacted with the other characters - especially Luke. We grew to care about them as well. The main antagonist was mysterious, dark, evil, with just enough light within him to make the character very intriguing. We wanted to see how the fight between good and evil would turn out between the good characters we cared about and the powerful and evil Darth Vader and his troops. Fast forward to Episode VII. The writers had so little confidence in their abilities to produce new characters on the same level as Luke, Leia, and Han that they decided to actually bring back the old characters. And they ruined them in the process. They were not able to keep the magic that those characters brought in the first place. Their characters were largely wasted - especially Luke who was not only wasted but disrespectfully trashed. R2-D2 and 3-CPO have basically been forgotten in the recent episodes. They cannot be the same without their interactions with Luke and other main characters. Even Chewbacca cannot be close to the same with his great interactions with Han.<br/><br/>The main problem for director Abrams in Episode IX is that there are no characters left that viewers are really connected to. Rey, Finn, and Poe have been so poorly developed that they are but a fraction of what Luke, Han, and Leia were. The viewers are so disconnected from them that many don't even care if they live or die. The emotional attachment just isn't on the same level as with Luke, Leia, and Han. The antagonist, Snoke, - who was killed off in the most laughably ridiculous manner - was never a menacing character anyway. He was certainly no Darth Vader. Kylo Ren - is played well by Adam Driver - is likely the best character in the new generation. However, he, too, is no Darth Vader. This is not the same level of doom and foreboding. So, how does director Abrams make a compelling episode IX? The sad answer is . . . he doesn't. There is no way that Episode IX can work because the proper development of the characters and story never occurred in the previous two episodes leading up to it. And that is the main problem that will likely doom these three episodes as failures.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

However, The Last Jedi is a film while has some great visuals and some very good acting from the cast but is a film flawed in the sense that the film feels like a filler chapter in a trilogy. Unlike the original trilogy where The Empire Strikes Back was a film which had strong narrative a felt like it's own film, The Last Jedi feels like it's only there to connect the first film to the third film. The reasons for this is simply because this film contains nothing of substance which you can take away from it, other than the death of a character which I will not spoil here. I hope that Star Wars films from now on are much better than this and actually tell a good story because this left me feeling empty and wanting more from this film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Terrible middle act subplot. Clumsy poorly written political commentary. Many cringe worthy moments. Terrible comedy. Very inconsistent, jarring changes in tone. Does nothing to further the previous movies set ups, or set up next movie. Killed all the momentum Star was had. Does not have the Star Wars magic. Did nothing to further the Star Was mythology. Full of gotcha moments instead of creative ideas, and story telling. This is a movie that does not understand itself. As bad as the first two prequels. Also, this movie has aged very poorly.

This crap while it claims to be star wars, lacks any of the defining characteristics of the preceding films. Say what you will about the prequels, but this (and also the Force Awakens) lack the tone and feel of what we have come to expect from a star wars film. While it is oftentimes a good thing for a director to take us in a new direction, Rian Johnson has demonstrated a lack of a fundamental understanding of any of the preceding material. Had Rian Johnson spent more time developing a plot, rather than "subverting our expectations",  as approving critics would say, thereby creating a nonsensical dumpster fire of a story, writing Marvel-type jokes for otherwise serious scenes, and stuffing Disney's political agenda down our throats once again, perhaps this movie could have been mediocre. This movie deserves a zero rating because, with it, they have irreparably damaged the in-universe legacy of the original trilogy with a story that really makes no sense.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And if those who made it hadn't tried their damnedest to paint the entirety of the fanbase as racist, pouting fanboys based on a small percentage of that fanbase, then I wouldn't have done my damnedest to write reviews on every single review site I could find proclaiming this movie as **** You're welcome Darth Disney.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8458105"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The Last Jedi is easily the worst of the entire Star Wars franchise. It takes the decent content from The Force Awakens (Rey’s Parents, Who is Snoke, Who are the Knights of Ren…) , and promptly douses it in gasoline whilst replacing those charred remains with poorly written characters and boring story arcs.<br/>Luke Skywalker was handled worse than imaginable and is completely contrary of his character in the Original Trilogy. Leia meanwhile felt cheaply manipulated, and dumb (Especially in a certain Mary-Poppins scene) . With Carrie Fisher sadly passing away almost a year before the film was released, you’d think it would make more sense to let her die heroically and keep Luke for the final movie, but not for Rian Johnson or Kathleen Kennedy apparently.<br/>Meanwhile, the new characters introduced such as Rose and Holdo felt completely out of place and useless to the story. Both of them feel unneeded, and crowbarred in to fill the diversity quota whilst being unbelievable and cringy (Rose) or tactically inept and unnecessary (Holdo). Similarly, all of the characters introduced in The Force Awakens are held back by the writers.<br/>For example; General Hux is a tactical imbecile, acting as a punchbag for low rate jokes that make him feel more like a dumb Superhero baddie for children rather than the intelligent Grand Moff Tarkin, or the intimidating General Grievous. Similarly, Captain Phasma is poorly utilised (especially considering the acting skill of Gwendoline Christine) and should have had a far more meaningful role in the story.<br/>Rey, Poe, Finn and Kylo all feel held back from their true potential. Rey feels unstoppable; as she is constantly shown to overcome every obstacle rather than have any meaningful struggle or show character development in any form. Poe and Finn seem to be used to quick audience laughs and to have their role stolen by other characters (namely weak characters). Kylo Ren feels too unrelatable and many intriguing ideas (What if Luke turned Kylo good, but Snoke turned Rey evil?) seem to have been thrown out because the writers feel like they don’t care.<br/>This movie is pretty, which gets it the 1/10, but its sets lack the imagination of past Star Wars’. Ahch-To is boring and could have been so much more interesting and steeped in mystery; but all we got was a bunch of stone age huts and some milk giraffes. Other sets just feel jammed into the story for no reason (Canto-Bight) or ripped without thought from previous films. The plot is as perforated as a cheese grater, as well as feeling long and braindead. Disney are using this franchise as a cash cow and are milking it drier than the Atacama.<br/>TL;DR: If you wanted to experience what a crap fan fiction sequel of Star Wars written by a bunch of people who’ve only watched it once and see far too much through the eyes of a crazed feminazi AND you also want it to be a weak Superhero gig then this is the film for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It ignores the continuity of the previous movies and their characters to show you Rian's vision. This movie divided the fanbase to the point of creating a boycott of the following movie : Solo a Star Wars story, which was the most expensive SW film to date and the biggest flop of the franchise. This movie ends all plot points leaving you no reason to want to see the next installement in the franchise. Not recommended if you're a fan of the franchise. Although Ivan Ortega is planning a fan re-edit of this wasted opportunity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It feels like everyone's OC (original character) got screentime.<br/>- Chewbacca just kind of disappears from the plot randomly.<br/>- When Rey reaches the island Luke is living on, there's this sea monster thing you see briefly in the water behind Rey.  It wasn't particularly offensive but I remember thinking "was that necessary?" and from then on there was a constant barrage of CGI aliens and creatures that was like the prequels on steroids.<br/>- Soon after Luke milks an alien species.  The camera zooms in on its nipples.  It seems put there entirely to make kids go "eww!" and is roughly on the same level as fart jokes.<br/>- Maz shows up and says there's a master code breaker and that they need to recruit him.  Finn and, for some reason, Rose go to a gambling planet.  The whole place is.. really far from Star Wars aesthetic.  It's this kind of super high fashion Lady Gaga music video.<br/>- The code breaker is introduced and is a character for like 10 seconds but then doesn't even matter, why is he even there?  Why are so many of these characters even there?<br/>- Around this point they randomly establish that the Resistance gets its fighters and weapons from a slave labor planet then just kind of ignore it later..?  What?<br/>- There's a whole blatant allegorical element to the gambling planet and, listen, I hate oligarchies too, but it's really childish.  There's pauper children and a whole side plot with these animals which are kind of like race horses and it doesn't really go anywhere.<br/>- There's a weird furry hole that is the source of dark energy on the island and Rey falls into it but it's actually not that bad, there's just some water and a trippy mirror that she sees a bunch of copies of herself in, then she's out of the hole later and it never really seems to matter.<br/>- Luke is involved in this line of thinking that the Jedi and Sith are basically the same.  He does a terrible job at explaining it, basically saying that the Jedi are vain and the Sith are genocidal.  Are vanity and genocide really on the same level?<br/>- Leia is suddenly a Jedi god.  Not a master, a god.  She can fly around in space and knock down doors with her damned mind.  At the end of Return of the Jedi it was established that like Luke, she was force sensitive.  This is fine.  Her suddenly expressing more power than Yoda is not.<br/>- Snoke's death is weird.  He's apparently super powerful and can sense all your thoughts but can't sense Kylo sneaking a lightsaber next to him and igniting it into his gut.<br/>- Laura Dern shows up with purple Hunger Games hair and is a REALLY uncomfortable character.  The actress has a history of roles in films as realistic modern day people (and she really is a magnificent actress), and she comes across like that here.  It feels as awkward as casting Reese Witherspoon or Julia Roberts would have been.<br/>- Poe stages a weird coup against Laura Dern and then is pretty much instantly foiled, seriously the plot does a sharp, tight loop here for no reason and everyone forgives him while he's still unconscious.  Like, everyone could have died?  Why are people acting like it was cute?<br/>- Okay, if even BB droids can operate assault vehicles alone and take down a hallway full of guards, why don't they?  Why even have troops?<br/>- During the escape from the Resistance flagship, they claim that the First Order won't track small vessels.  Why?  In A New Hope a star destroyer tracks even tiny escape pods, why has technology gotten worse?<br/>- They go to Crait (no, not krayt like the dragon) and Rose reveals that she's in love with Finn.  We seriously don't even know her and they've had absolutely zero chemistry up until this point and the scene is really uncomfortable.<br/>- There's a fight scene with Kylo and Luke.  Okay, we established that Leia is a force god, right?  Well Luke is now a Super Saiyan ultra mega god who can project himself across the galaxy and physically interact with people and he goes Obi-Wan Kenobi style and he's like "if you kill me I'll just get stronger" but then he's like "Sike that's the wrong number!" and pulls out all the way across the god damned galaxy.<br/>- The pauper children were straight out of Oliver Twist and kind of uncomfortable and the film ends with some kid who I can only assume has a terrible cockney accent and is like, a chimney sweep or something, using a broom as a lightsaber.<br/><br/>Anyway, at least the prequels are watchable now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Some good visuals (I like the modified AT-ATs) and a few good moments, but they're lost in the overall morass of mediocrity. Setups from TFA: wasted. Finn's character arc: wasted. Snoke: wasted. Rey's origin: wasted. Luke: wasted. Light-saber battle: lumbering, pedestrian choreography. NR backstory: non-existent. Incompetent + cringe-worthy leadership and decision-making from the Resistance. Was it bad that I started rooting for the First Order?<br/><br/>What are we left with? Ren and Hux are joke antagonists. There is no credible threat against  M'Rey Sue protagonist. Finn is now a clown, having been given an excellent start in TFA. Chewie and Poe are about the only ones left worth watching, and they're secondary characters. So what's the draw for Ep IX?

The Movie Just smells of White Male Oppression. The Old Guy SMOKE(BAD BAD GUY), SNOKE, I can't remember looks like an old white guy, who gets chopped in half by the Female Leftist Marxist Feminist Lead.

The Last Jedi was by far the worst I've seen. The movie seemingly drops many important plots from the Force Awakens and probably due to Rian Johnson's leadership as director. He cared more for practical effects than anything else and I felt that he focused far too much on those aspects rather than on the actual plot of the film.<br/><br/>The immense confusion that came from this movie are listed:<br/>1. Rey suddenly knows how to use a lightsaber with great form.<br/>2. Snoke dies after not revealing much about his character.<br/>3. Learned more about how animals were being mistreated than we learned about Snoke in the    two films.<br/>4. Why hasn't anybody tried to use lightspeed to destroy things in the past. (Why didn't  the Rebels simply program on send an empty ship at lightspeed toward the Death Star???)<br/>5. How does Snoke not sense the force that Kylo is using to move the lightsaber???<br/>6. Captain Phasma "dies" in the worst way. (UNSURE)<br/>7. Luke DIES in the worst way. Doesn't even go out like a boss. Didn't really do much for    most of the movie except mope around and reject Rey.<br/>8. SNOKE DIES??!!<br/>9. Leia suddenly knows force powers???!!!!<br/>10. Rey lifts what I would describe as a SH#T TON of rocks. While Luke (ONE OF THE MOST    POWERFUL FORCE USERS OF ALL OF STAR WARS LORE) took seemingly weeks to train to lift a    rock.<br/>11. REY HAS VIRTUALLY NO TRAINING YET STILL KNOWS HOW TO USE THE FORCE AND WIELD A    LIGHTSABER LIKE A TRAINED JEDI!!!<br/>12. Rose Tico is quite possibly the worst character in Star Wars history as she stops Finn    from sacrificing himself to save THE WHOLE RESISTANCE.<br/>13. Anticlimactic meeting of Luke and Kylo<br/>14. LUKE DIES????!!!!<br/>15. Luke does an Astral Projection which essentially projects your body to wherever you    want it at the cost of your LIFE. WHY??? Luke "saves" the resistance.<br/>16. Why is Leia kept alive after the unfortunate passing of Carrie Fisher and Luke is    killed while Mark Hamill is still alive and well and very disappointed in the way Luke    was treated.<br/><br/>I can't write anymore I feel this pretty much sums up The Last Jedi.<br/><br/>“He’s not my Luke Skywalker".</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8442694"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Get ready to read. I have a lot to say. When Supreme Leader Snoke said "Darkness rises and light to meet it," he wasn't kidding. Never before have I seen a film that is such a bewildering blend of brilliance and idiocy. Half of Star Wars: The Last Jedi works wonderfully and the other half is just brainless. I don't understand people who refuse to admit that there's anything wrong with the movie not do I understand those who refuse to admit that anything about it was good.<br/><br/>There's a lot to say and I won't get to all of it here, but I'll start with what worked. By far the best aspect of The Last Jedi is the character arcs of Rey and Kylo Ren. The bond that they form is an intellectually gripping one. Kylo Ren is a fantastic villain because he is so easily understood. It's elaborated in great detail how everyone in his life has failed him and in the end he really comes across as sympathetic and his goals make a lot of sense--so much so that Rey is tempted to join him. When evil is able to take the form of something logical and enticing, that's when you know it's been portrayed in the most effective possible way. Rey's character serves to anchor the film in its themes of disappointment, failure, redemption and heroism. Throughout the story she comes to realize that she has been placing her hope in false perception of others and that she--despite her humble origins--is no less valuable or capable than even the highest-ranking leaders. She acknowledges, like Kylo Ren, that the past certainly has its moments of shame and failure. But she goes beyond his mindset of "killing the past" by recognizing that there are still good things worth protecting and she takes the responsibility of protecting the light upon herself. It's a powerful character arc--one of the best in the entire saga--and makes the film's deep themes all the more thought-provoking.<br/><br/>The Last Jedi is a gorgeous-looking movie. I believe it to be the most visually stunning of the franchise. Rian Johnson's use of color, sound, and diverse camera work makes the galaxy look better than it ever has before.<br/><br/>Many people dislike the humor of the new Star Wars films, but I enjoy it. What's wrong with injecting a little lightheartedness into the story? The original trilogy had its dark moments with some humorous moments thrown in there as well. The jokes in The Last Jedi are mostly funny but also are never excessive to the point of losing out on the poignant narrative.<br/><br/>Everyone seems to think that there are a ton of plot holes in The Last Jedi, but what they really mean is that there are some unanswered questions, and that's not the same thing. Just because things are left unexplained does not make them plot holes, and if you need to be spoon-fed the deeper logic of every single additional force power and space warfare tactic explored here than thinking critically about them, then you are a dumb viewer. The Star Wars universe is rich with lore from novels, guides, the animated series' and more. Nearly all unanswered questions can be answered by these things. If every odd-seeming thing were to be completely elaborated upon in this film, it would have made the movie several hours longer. After a lot of thinking, I don't think any of the new abilities or aspects added in The Last Jedi are problematic in any way, except for maybe hyperspace ramming. If this is possible, why hasn't it been used before, if it's so effective? But I digress. Now for what didn't work.<br/><br/>The entire subplot on Canto Bight in the casino was completely unnecessary. It made the film about 20 minutes too long and added nothing to the characters' development or even to the plot itself. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who believes otherwise.<br/><br/>The character of Rose is by far the worst character in the film, arguably the worst in the entire saga. She's unfunny, annoying, underdeveloped, and obliterates Finn's potential-filled character arc. Finn should have been allowed to follow through on sacrificing himself when he was doing the suicide-run to destroy The First Order's cannon. It would have been a spectacular farewell to him as he has spent the last two films learning to overcome fear and to embrace selflessness and would have died completing his journey. Instead, we get the half-baked line about how we need to "not kill what we hate, but save what we love," even though the only way to save what you love is by killing what opposes it, but whatever. There are so many parts of this film that were building up to something incredible and moving that just don't follow through--characters that could have been so much more compelling but were missing something essential (motivation, resolution, etc.). It makes the Last Jedi a very disappointing film because it does have some ingenious aspects but just missed the mark on so much that is ends up being just okay.<br/><br/>Story: 5.5<br/>Acting: 8.5<br/>Script: 6.5<br/>Visuals/Sound: 10<br/>Entertainment Value: 7<br/><br/>OVERALL SCORE: 7.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movies for the children who dont know better. And thats what makes it okay for most, but not for an enthusiast who appreciates continuity in a universe kept alive by an undying fan base that expects things to at least be consistent, not radically poignant when it comes to Star Wars lore.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8435873"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I have been reading a lot about this movie since I saw it about 2 weeks ago. I avoided all the hype leading up to it and never managed to see it in theaters. I didn’t pay attention and didn’t even know that there was this whole back and forth about this movie with trolls, backlash, etc… and I certainly didn’t have a “fan theory” to apply to this movie. Oh, and I am not a bot or overzealous “fanboy” either.<br/>I grew up on Star Wars original trilogy as a kid. My brother and I had (and loved) the Star Wars action figures and other toys, it was part of our world back then.  I saw the prequel trilogy and was generally a bit disappointed, but now I see that everything, including disappointment, is relative. I actually liked more about Revenge of the Sith than I disliked. So, onto this movie: I hated it, flat-out. To me, it was a combination of cop-outs and cringeworthily moments.  I’ve read a lot of reviews from professional movie critics and have seen the same thing over and over: something along the lines of “this movie bravely went in a new direction and did not feel ‘constrained’ by the past”  . Pause right there: this is not a good thing in and of itself, especially when the tradition established by the prior movies create the coat-tails that this movie is riding on. It reminds me exactly of how I thought about Peter Jackson’s treatment of “The Hobbit” after he did such a good job overall with “Lord of the Rings”. Seeing the bar drop so low can make one with standards become very cynical. The fan reviews appear to be written, for the most part, by people who saw something that frustrated them so much that they felt compelled to vent about it, as the only avenue open to them. That’s where I stand, even knowing probably no one will read this. And, yes, I opened this account solely to write this one review for this one movie. Other reviewers blasted so many holes in the plot that I don’t feel the need to do a similar laundry-list of what is wrong with this movie, and honestly there are a few re-occurring complaints that I don’t find to be a problem.<br/>Cop-outs:<br/>Who was Snoke, where did he come from, why was he so powerful, how was he able to build the First order out of the defeated Empire. No explanation and no plausibility offered<br/>How did the Rebel Alliance go from victor to diminished band of outlaws?<br/>What is the backstory with Luke and Ben Solo? Too much is glossed over<br/>It’s like the Rebel victory at Endor and Jakuu didn’t even happen. Kylo Ren: not a convincing villain at all, reminds me of Edward from Twilight Cringe-worthy moments:<br/>Prank phone call from Po to Hux- this really set the bar so low right from the start…<br/>Porgs.. and interaction with Chewbacca.. culminating in one of them wearing a ^&%$ porg-sized headset in the cockpit of Millennium Falcon The Rose character… out of place in the Star wars universe. Too preachy and naive and forced relationship with Finn (who I thought was supposed to be involved with Rey ?). Casino scenes. Over the top CGI characters plugging coins into BB8 lot a slot machine, then he (?) shoots them out like a machine gun at some guard Of course, princess Leia’s using the force to suck her back into the ship.. jeezus that was one of the worst moments in cinematic history right there. Re-hash of battle of Hoth : it had some good points, but too much like a re-occurring sequence from Empire Strikes back. At least there were no salt tuan-tuans… but the crystal coyotes of salt-world were one of those out-of-place childish elements that were used because, you know, we have CGI and can place anything in a movie. BB8 hot-wiring a scout walker on board Star Destroyer.<br/>Rey not needing any real training to become bad-ass force user able to levitate rocks that Luke couldn’t even do.<br/>Wasted scene with Rey going into hole on Luke’s planet wasted time where nothing profound is uncovered or learned.<br/>The whole way Luke was. Obi-wan also “lost” Anakin to the dark side, but he wasn’t the same grouch that they turned Luke into. Agree with others that the whole idea of Luke leaving a map to his location is in direct contradiction to the way Luke was when he was found. The defenses of these departures from the established Star Wars universe have been described as “brave” or  “visionary” or whatever by the professional critics I have read, but many other fans, think they suck. If the only measure of quality is if you go against all tradition and continuity that came before you, we could all write stories where water flows uphill and the critics would be singing our praises because we were so brave to go against tradition (and physics) and do something “new”. I’m glad that I don’t feel the need to be as attached to this as I did when I was young and impressionable, but Star Wars is now dead to me, I won’t bother with Episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Particularly the Luke Skywalker character, I have been a lifelong fan and have loved all the movies, read the novels, watched the cartoons, purchased the toys, collected memorabilia, attended SW events etc. etc. I loved the prequels, (except maybe the midichlorians thing) and really liked, I mean really loved TFA and all the new stories and possibilities it created. I didn’t have a fan theory, and I wasn’t looking for nostalgia coming into TLJ, I just wanted the story to continue. Instead what I got is the character assassination of Luke, all the interesting new characters become irrational and pointless and a bunch of plot holes and new cannon that makes the suspension of disbelief more difficult for this and all the other past movies. The visuals were Amazing, the fight scenes and the space fights were also probably the best in the franchise. And the porgs were adorable. The new planets were visually stunning and super interesting for future media. But I just can’t get past the narrative; the actual story being told itself, mostly characters making decisions inconsistent with their personalities, pointless side stories.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The animal-care scene (casino), the way Poe is a stubborn guy which learns a valuable lesson after confronting Leia and the pink haired lady from Jurassic Park, those orphan kids from Annie, and the romance between Finn and that terrible, awful, Rose character are SO Disney, I don't think I could handle the third film but I can't wait for this nightmare to end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8428774"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">No specific spoilers (names/dates/places), but definitely references events in the movie.<br/><br/>In a word: lazy.<br/><br/>The Last Jedi has some beautiful sequences and impressive attention to detail in many areas - I certainly wouldn't say Johnson can't direct a visually wonderful film. Unfortunately, however, these details are betrayed by a stupendously lazy story that seems to entirely revolve around incompetence on both sides.<br/><br/>Most of the problems the First Order and Resistance have could have been resolved by having effective leadership - sure this is something that can and has happened in real life, but watching the two sides bumble around ineffectually is simply not engaging as a viewer. In particular the trope of 'this could have been resolved if you hadn't lied/withheld information' sets off a whole secondary plotline which doesn't even go anywhere.<br/><br/>Then there's the fact that the film seems to entirely forget realistic consequences for actions - a lone, stationary fighter would be obliterated if parked next to the enemy fleet taunting their commander. Similarly two soldiers (one injured) would be captured or killed if they crashed their vehicles directly in front of an overwhelming enemy force.<br/><br/>Adding in a convenient superweapon that is relatively cheap and effective for guerilla fighters will now take considerable retconning and handwaving to keep the in-universe logic believable.<br/><br/>High speed ramming someone to stop them performing a heroic sacrifice is a ludicrous solution. Not only is it a miracle that you won't both be killed, but also destroys the only hope you have of saving them. (Even a minor chance is better than nothing).<br/><br/><br/>I could go on, but hopefully you'll get the idea. These are all concepts or scenes that were clearly played out to look cool but only serve to make every person appear blind, stupid or incompetent.<br/><br/><br/>Then there are the story choices. This is a matter of opinion, so I appreciate that for many people the story was perfect. Personally, I felt Johnson was trying too hard to 'subvert' the story by essentially cutting every possible thread from previous Star Wars movies. I won't say it's 'killed' Star Wars or my childhood, but it cheapens everything that went before when you realise their lives, deaths and trials were meaningless. It makes the stories hollow when you see everything they went through didn't make any difference. Which bring me to the final point...<br/><br/><br/>'The Force' is now a galactic scale as per this movie. It is characterised as continuously pitting light and dark against each other in the name of balance and will raise up force users to achieve this goal.<br/><br/>So...what's the point? If an external power is seeing to it that one side can NEVER triumph, then what are the stakes? What is the point? Where is it going when everything is at a permanently enforced stalemate?<br/><br/>It appears the real story is about some unseen motives that 'The Force' has, but we are consigned to watching it play with its toys instead.<br/><br/><br/>In summary....<br/><br/><br/>Visually stunning and reasonably entertaining but severely let down by lazy script writing and blinkered approach to the choice and consequence of story telling. On its own I'd have given it a five, but will deduct one further for making the preceding 16 hours of movies a waste of my time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I watched the movies cause there were entertaining and the light-saber & space battle were cool. But this movie is beyond bad ! Seeing Chewbacca having some thought about becoming a vegan even if he is a 200 years old alien beast, should just convince you how much this movie is crap.<br/><br/>Rey is useless, her story pointless. Same for Snoke, same for everything and everyone...<br/><br/>I think that people putting good score on this movie are the same people that try to convince themselves that modern art is actually art... It's pathetic !<br/><br/>This movie is pure sh*t, the actors don't even try to be credible because they know the plot of that new Disney trilogy don't make any sens. It just an bad attempt to make money on the nostalgia of people ! And the worst part is : it actually work. They earned a ton of money from that movie ! What a shame, what a f*cking shame.<br/><br/>I will not go see the others movies, Star Wars is dead to me!
