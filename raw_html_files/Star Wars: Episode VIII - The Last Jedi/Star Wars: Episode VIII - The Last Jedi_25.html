The color scheme should've been darker, the dialogue was too campy, and due to those factors the movie never found its identity. This movie felt like it belonged next to the Jarjar binks disaster. I'm not sure why the little birds were included at all, Chewy was cut in for nostalgic purposes and had zero effect on the plot. Or why Leia was able to fly through space??? Are you kidding me? Or how about when Luke told Rey at the end of the first lesson that he couldn't teach her anymore and she didn't resist the dark...and then literally 2 minutes later and with no dialogue in between or forward plot movement he goes "Lesson 2...". Felt like I was taking crazy pills. The movie bounced in between terrible cheap jokes. The lone bright spot in the movie were the scenes of Rey and Rylo connecting, the suspense and tension were at their highest during those scenes. Also, why did the flying go karts need to drag an antenna on the mining planet at the end, why would that help them fly better??? So there could be more useless distracting color added to the screen? The entire scene looked like it was manaufactured for an instagram photo shoot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Disney wants to make money going forward, and that means changing the skew of the core demo. And that's all this movie is -- trying to skew the movie to a younger audience. As a business decision, it's probably the correct one.<br/><br/>Sadly, they created a mediocre movie. Visually, this film is stunning. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are both extremely talented actors. They both put in great performances. But the massive plot holes, the terrible narrative choices, and the criminal wastes of the audience's time conspire to make the film, as a whole, simply...meh.<br/><br/>Star Wars movies have always been about black and white morality tales. Sometimes you get a gray-ish character in there for flavor. This attempt to create Breaking Bad in space undermines that history. And it commits some fundamental narrative sins: don't set the audience up for a big reveal, then not give it to them. Poor storytelling and poor writing.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson told us we wouldn't like his movie, in not so many words. We should take him at his word.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But there were some thin plot threads that might have saved the series so I kept an open mind. No such luck!! This abomination is a deliberate insult to George Lucas and his millions of fans who came to identify with the larger than self issues and heroic sacrifices of his characters. It is a sign of the times, this movie is bad because our modern culture is bad. Shaming and destroying beloved characters, hollowing out the whole concept of the force and inappropriate humor all are designed to mask the thousand pound gorilla in the room- THERE IS NO STORY!!!! Shock and dismay is somehow supposed to replace plot and substance, and of course the kids will eat it up. Many of them have a fetish to cut down the previous generation and appropriate what was ours. The one overriding message of Disney Wars: The Snuff Film is that story doesn't matter, only theme park rides, toys and SJW agitprop. I blame the Lucas and Prequel haters. They couldn't handle an in depth story and wet their pj's over it. Now there is nothing left but a joke of a franchise lampooning itself while grinning like they won a Nobel prize. At least we get to see Kylo Ren on a bag of salad and a can of soup.......</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

On a deeper note, the film debates some great issues: reflection on youth in the old age, debates between good and evil, and using non-violence to succeed in a war. On a visual note, the cinematography and visual effects are absolutely mindblowing. On top of this, witty humour, cute new species, and good fight scenes are sprinkled throughout the film. As a long-term Star Wars fan, I believe this film has outdone it's prequel in the new trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I’ll tackle the issues one by one. It’s literally death by a thousand cuts for this film. It doesn’t do things catastrophically wrong, but it screws up with many small but pivotal things at once.  1a) THE PLOT -  or rather the lack of it. Characters don’t move forward in any meaningful way. The plot too is pretty much non-existent. All it does it tie up some thread plots but there is a serious lack of forward momentum. Whereas, The Empire Strikes Back (the BEST Star Wars, period) ended with “I AM YOUR FATHER” moment, resulting in one of those 2nd in a trilogy film, which have a brilliant climax and yet sets the next one. The Last Jedi, however, does not have an end aim. The climax is non-existent, and the stakes just don’t feel high enough. What exactly is the end-game? 1b) THE THREAD INVOLVING FINN AND ROSE – So there is a full 30-35-minute thread dedicated to these two where they are tasked with infiltrating the Orders’ Main Ship and to disable it’s tracking device. So far so good. They go to this planet, in order to find a hacker, have an elongated chase sequence, get the wrong guy, board the main ship, get caught and basically do nothing! So, you have 35+ minutes of screen time which literally adds nothing to the core story or fits in the larger schema of things. 2) LACK OF DRAMA – The film lacks a gut-punching scene or any scene which evokes some kind of an emotion. How does Rey realize her potential? The Empire Strikes Back had a whole sequence dedicated to Luke being stranded and figuring out how to master the force so that he can escape the planet and join the battle. His motivations are set, and his actions have agency, Luke goes through the struggle before becoming a master. Rey just does it, goes through no hardship, she just gets it. In this movie, however, everyone sans Luke lacks personality in their characters. They are just harbingers of actions with no purpose and nothing else in between. It’s all too generic, the plot, the motivations, the set-pieces. 3) LACK OF HEROISM – The film deviates from its ‘western’ roots to something which is well, universal as well as generic. You do get a feeling that this is more of a feminine film (female commanders/fighters all of a sudden), which is fine. But then, fleeing instead of leading the charge and not doing something of consequence is not exactly I say ‘dramatic’. Where is the dramatic sacrifice (apart from one scene)? Where is the heroism? And the most heroic guy (Poe) gets reprimanded for it! Where is the risk-taking? And where is the audacity? There is a massive undertone of feminism and equal representation which is fine as long as it is not at odds with the well-being of the film. Give everyone a chance but not at the expense of the plot. It almost feels like a quota system with equal representation at work. Ok, so let’s give our female lead a scene, follow it up with a scene of the black guy and mix him with a South-East Asian. Now, get the female queen and then the legendary Luke……rinse/repeat and everyone go out happy. As a result, what suffers are the characters. No one is given enough time to cook, no plot thread is taken to its logical conclusion. It’s corporate flattening at its worst. This flattening strips the film with any kind of personality it could have possessed Even Luke dies in a supremely uneventful way. Like C’mon. Luke is Sci-Fi action hero incarnate. The destroyer of Death Star and Vader and you kill him like this? His death should have been bombastic, instead, it’s a whimper. All he does is brood and milk aliens :/ You just don’t screw with the character of Luke Skywalker like this.... case closed. For Rey, what’s her heroism? She can lift Rocks!! Great! She thinks she can change a bad boy in her own image, even better! 4) KYLO REN – Seriously, this character is THE WEAKEST LINK in the film. Vader inspired dread, Skywalker inspired Heroism, this guy just inspires pity! All he does is sulk and cry and behave like a baby. How can this character be taken seriously let alone villainous? 5) UNPLACED HUMOR – Star Wars usually have had its share of humour. The banter between C3PO and R2Ds, Han Solo’s one-liners. But they were treated in an almost Shakespearean way, i.e. there were scenes set aside for comic relief. Here, unfortunately, jokes come at the most inopportune dramatic moment. Villains lose their power when their action ends in humour, or Luke his heroism when (spoiler) after being attacked from multiple Tie-Fighters and AT-Ts shrugs dust from his shoulders. The film is generic, too generic in fact. Like Luke’s X Wings in Empire Strikes Back, this film is stuck in a swamp. Hope the force is strong with the next instalment and I dare say with it possessing a bit more heroism and pathos. P.S. – The owl creatures are cute, but c’mon, they gotta serve a purpose!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The plot makes no sense. The entire story of the resistance amounts to a slow motion car chase with a pointless side quest tacked on for the sole purpose of filming another funky star wars theme planet. The few decent battle sequences we get are brief and simplistic, and every hint of a true fight between the main characters either becomes a giant fake-out or simply gets interrupted by EXPLOSIONS before anything interesting can happen. It's like the writers were determined to make the answer to every mystery from TFA "nothing" as if that would make the movie interesting and mysterious, and instead it just makes every reveal a big let down.<br/><br/>So many characters are absolutely wasted. Luke is reduced to the role of cowardly hermit who refuses to do anything for the entire film, and even when you think he has finally joined the fight it's really a mirage, just like this film.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7928707"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Reading through the media’s reaction to The Last Jedi I get the impression that I, as a star wars fan, am not allowed to have an opinion on this star wars movie. “You don’t get it” they say smugly- it’s a new direction. A new direction, I guess, that involves reinventing established characters, reinventing an established universe, and destroying established lore? “Let the past die. Kill it if you have to” says Kylo Ren, and I absolutely believe this is what Rian Johnson wanted to do. Yoda destroys the Jedi tree because it’s not the point of the Jedi religion, apparently. He does this while laughing at Luke remember - no respect for the Jedi heritage, the sacrifice of their ancestors, or even some basic respect for preserving history – no, the agenda is to destroy it all and start from scratch. What kind of people usually adopt this approach?<br/><br/>This “Reinvention” borders on the petty. JJ Abrams has set up a fascinating and mysterious villain in Snoke –  but this doesn’t suit the agenda, so he is killed – easily and stupidly by an immature apprentice who was just born better apparently. So into the trash with the enormous amount of training and effort that mastery of the force demands - Rey has no teacher and yet she’s just as strong as Kylo. So complete is Rian Johnson’s vision that he is not content to stop with reinventing Star Wars. American storytelling has relied heavily on the brash, aggressive young warrior for generations, and Poe Dameron is certainly that man. He is skillful, courageous and knows when to take risks – exactly the kind of soldier a desperate rebellion needs. At the start of the film we see him lead an assault which costs the rebellion dearly – kind of like the battle of Scarif in Rogue One. Heroism, sacrifice, perseverance against the odds - with the incredible outcome that a terrifying First Order weapon is destroyed, the Fleet is able to escape …and Poe is demoted and chastised?<br/><br/>Of course it’s not enough that he is shamed – he must be taught obedience - Poe is humiliated as he struggles to save the rebellion - is kept in the dark by his command and is ultimately shot by Leia. The lesson is obvious: The western warrior archetype is a fool with his head in his cockpit, motivated only by the selfish desire for glory. So much for the western storytelling tradition. See also: the contempt in Luke’s voice when he says “a legend” to Rey, before he walks away from everything his younger self fought for. See also: Finn’s brave self-sacrifice to defend the rebellion, denied by Rose in the most staggeringly senseless act of the whole movie. Fortunately a magic super girl -a heroine who has achieved incredible power, not by self introspection, sacrifice, life experience, or sincere effort, but by literally doing nothing - is on hand to save everyone from the consequences of their awful decisions. It also helps that enough of the rebellion was senselessly murdered that the remainder can comfortably fit aboard one small freighter.<br/><br/>So Rian killed the past - and what did he have as a replacement? Stupid jokes, cute critters, cast diversity and storytelling incompetence.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Director Rian Johnson clearly was given full creative freedom to tell the story he wanted and take characters into whatever direction he wanted. This film is already one of the most divisive blockbusters to ever come out in theaters, at least among hardcore fans. For some fans, The Last Jedi is not the film they wanted at all and they have some legitimate reasons. I have spent the last 5 days coming to terms with my full feelings about this movie. Not everything in this movie works, some of the humor doesn't work, the whole Rose/Finn/Poe plotline is weak in structure with a few plot holes, and some ideas could have been executed better (Leia using the force is awesome, but why did she have to look like some hokey superhero while using it?). The other gripes I had with The Last Jedi when I came out of the theater for the first time came down to how wildly unmet my expectations for the story were. Rian Johnson makes subverting expectations a clear theme of the story, and it often seems obvious that Johnson deliberately makes the touch choices when it came to plot decisions. I think this film will eventually grow out of the the backlash and become appreciated for the huge risks it took and how it managed to make it all work so damn well. I don't expect some fans will ever change their minds, but I think most rational folks will come to see this film in a better light. The themes of failure and lost legacy are so strong and resonate through every pore of this work. Mark Hammil's perfomance as Luke Skywalker is one of the best of year, and if the Academy didn't hate space and fantasy movies, I would say it deserves a nomination, at least. This review won't convince the cynical fanatics who are spamming this film with overly negative scores, but I hope they eventually grow tired of hating things that other people enjoy. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is the First thing you’ll hear when someone says “Star Wars”, Isn't it.? ;) And our Desi awards stole even that :P<br/><br/>First thing first, when I heard about Princess Leia, Carrie Fisher, I just couldn't believe the news. I was so shocked. Then & then, I decided to watch this movie if no other reason but to give my respect to Carrie. She was The Best. May her Soul Rest In Peace. She did Fabulous work in this movie. Salute to her.<br/><br/>Now, the story isn't going ahead much. I’m a Spoiler-Free reviewer so I’ll not spoil anything but the movie definitely could've been better if written well. General overview which every Star Wars movie has in the beginning, In a galaxy, far far away...<br/><br/>Only one group of Resistance, a Spark, is there to fight the Supreme Leader. Meanwhile, Rey is trying to convince Luke Skywalker to train her so that she can control her Force, Light, & be able to fight Kylo Ren. Everything beyond would be Spoiler, So, Just Chill, I won’t spoil it.<br/><br/>Now, performances..<br/><br/>~ Daisy Ridley did Awesome job as Rey.. Just FYI, She’s The Last Jedi.. Sssshhhh, don’t tell anyone.. ;)<br/><br/>~ Oscar Isaac, Ma Man, Poe.. I’d love to watch him again & again. Just Fabulous Actor.. Poe is the New Han Solo ;)<br/><br/>~ Adam Driver, Kylo Ren’s struggling character played well. His character could've been written better.<br/><br/>~ Mark Hamill, in the beninging :D (I just remembered that video :D ) He’s Pain in the A, eventually he becomes less pain in the A ;)<br/><br/>~ John Boyega, Finn, He’s Alive :) Supported well.<br/><br/>~ Andy Serkis, Snoke, The Supreme Leader.. So Awesome He is.. You know what I did here ;)<br/><br/>~ Domhnall Gleeson, General Hux, Ohh Poor him :D<br/><br/>~ Lupita Nyong'o as Maz Kanata, Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico, Laura Dern as Vice Admiral Holdo, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Jimmy Vee as R2-D2 All did Very Well..<br/><br/>Last but not the Least, BB-8, I just Love It :D<br/><br/>On the Whole, The Last Jedi is The Best Entertainer you get at the Year End.. Don’t Miss It ;)<br/><br/>My Rate for The Last Jedi is... *drum rolls*...

I've been a Star Wars fan as long as I can remember, and Luke Skywalker was the hero of my boyhood.  But this movie was heavy handed with the political views of its creators.  It was the most 2017 thing I've ever seen.  Four days ago I was so excited to see it... now I am just heartbroken that the movie was so poorly written.  Star Wars is something we have loved for a very long time, and much of this movie is dedicated to destroying all of the Star Wars that came before it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I was soooooo looking forward to watching this movie but it was so god awful and **** it was like being back watching the Phantom Menace and walking out and thinking how could a Star Wars Movie be this **** At least the Phantom Menace FELT like a Star Wars movie, come back Jar Jar all is forgiven! Theres all of these people saying The Last Jedi was amazing, really???? - apparently good story isnt high up on the directors to do list, all i hear is it had good 'visuals' and its 'well made' and its 'bold' - bugger right off - how about GOOD STORY!!!!! and the fan boys all blindly saying its amazing and imagine anyone having the audacity to say it was **** - calling people haters or trolls etc - bugger off - if you read enough of the Negative comments including this one these negative reviews are written by REAL people, stop trying to excuse how **** this movie was - makes you look retarded and sad that your grasping at straws, your tiny little minds cant comprehend why the hate - if you loved the movie good for you, i really wish i saw the movie you saw or perhaps you were drunk or high on pop corn or sugar or something - was going to see this a 2nd time, guess what? - wont be happening! Star Wars The Last Jedi 0/10 for wasted potential and bugger your visuals - p.s. Chewbacca hid in the Falcons toilet the whole movie as he was scared if he came out he would get 'Boldly' killed......im amazed C3PO and R2D2 survived, perhaps saving their deaths for the next one!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The narrative jumps among several related plots, alternating fights and battles with moments of emotional drama. There are enough interesting effects and cute new creatures for the series to maintain its place as an innovator. Writer/director Rian Johnson has continued the legacy of compelling storytelling that keeps the films in our cultural spotlight. Those outside the fan base may be entertained, but those who love the Star Wars universe will find plenty to enjoy and cherish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Christ I could go on and on about how Luke was turned into mess of a character (props to Hamill though for staying professional and doing a kick ass performance) how the middle of tje movie was just the most mundane piece of **** ive witnessed, ah man im so gutted.<br/><br/>And seeing people defend it by saying only trolls are leaving a bad review?

One of the worst script I've ever seen in sci-fi films. It's full of plotholes, inconsistencies and idiotic characters. Not to mention violating even the simplest laws of physics like neglecting weightless in space or surviving in space without a spacesuit.<br/><br/>I feel really sorry for Hamill that he had to play that character, what they've done with Luke Skywalker is outrageous. With age comes wisdom? That's not about him in this movie, in Episode VIII with age comes obtusity, cowardice and lunacy. Yes that's how Luke Skywalker depicted there as obtuce timid lunatic who looks like he needs immidiate medical treatment.<br/><br/>If you are interested who's Snoke, why Rey has force abilities, why Ren suddenly turned into dark side, you will find no answers, moreover Snoke seems to be removed from the storyline being killed like an idiot in the middle of the film, this is probably one of the ''surprise twists'' creators were talking about.<br/><br/>There are no positives sides in the film except for decent play of Hamill and del Toro. Many people say about stunning visuals, but come on, who you can surprise with visuals in 2017? Modern technologies allow to make pretty good visuals even in mediocre sci-fi, let alone such expensive works like Star Wars, so this is no longer a feature you can brag about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's Star Wars after all. I can totally understand the negative outrage from fans, but compared to other 'normal' movies this is obviously not a 0/10 movie. There's a lot to like but just as much to absolutely hate. It does feel that Disney have too much sway. The whole Vegas World Alien Horse racing bit with Finn and Rose made me feel how I felt watching Shia LeBeef swinging through the jungle in Indian Jones and the Crystal Skull. It was just awful. I could see people in the cinema looking around uncomfortably at each other wondering what they were watching. It was totally unneeded and seems is only there for Disney to base a ride at one of their theme parks on.<br/><br/>I'm disliking most of the characters. Kylo Ren is the only one that I feel comfortable with on the whole. Although Benecio Del Toro was great, if woefully underused. His character felt authentic and engaging and could've been a great addition to franchise as a new lovable rouge type hero. I was willing him to come join the fight at the end. Rey I can just about get along with, although she's still not great. Po and Finn are just embarrassing and don't feel natural to me, overacted maybe. I wanted Finn to crash into the cannon at the end. He's not a great character. I quite liked Rose but she wasn't really needed. Bombers that drop bombs in space – uh hello gravity in space? There's countless annoyances, plot is full of holes, and it's overlong. But I'd be lying if I said I didn't kinda have fun watching it. But I definitely gave it way more passes because it was Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

More of like a Science Fiction film from China infringing on elements and characters of the Star Wars universe. If you thought Star Wars was a good movie then you don't really like or care about how good the Star Wars films were. This seemed literally more of a reboot. But it didn't go that route. Its still the same universe but now all of a sudden, everything works different and nothing makes sense. Gave it a two because visual effects did their job. Its confusing because Force Awakens, whether you liked or had mixed feeling for it... or even hated it, made you interested with these new characters. Some characters like Snoke, Poe, even "Mary Sue" Rey had interesting aspects to them that needed to be looked at more throughout the series. These characters literally make the clash between good and bad make sense. Well guess what? Absolutely not. Every character arc didn't matter. Snoke's character for example had to panned out. How does he gather the remnants of the Empire? Why do they follow him? What was his connection with Sidious and the Dark Side? Well... film goes... Who cares? It really is the worst Star Wars ever. Even worst than Phantom Menace. At least in that movie the bad actors had a role to play in the rest of the series. I watch this movie and go... who cares now? Where were the story designers? Where were the lore experts? Heard this idea that people who hated this movie are Fan Boyz or something of that nature... well maybe they just don't like bad movies. The only way a sane person liked this movie is if they go to movies to just say... well that was cool! And literally disregard the story and development of characters. If you liked the visual effects and the battles... sure... but even then at the highest maybe a 7 out of 10. The movie dragged. Too many parts where people who like that would be like... "that part was just not needed." The story was just simply put... bad. It really ruins the and warps the Star Wars universe. If you haven't seen it yet.... beware for Mary Poppins... in space.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm a star wars fan, like i love the original trilogy (i didn't care for prequels and i was 12 when phantom menace came out and thought it was stupid then - oh and numerous fights with the community about that), I didn't collect the plastic **** but played a lot of SW games, saw the movies a whole lot of times - the 1997 VHS edition. - I'm saying that only becasue there seems to be some kind of argument emerging that states that the movie offends fans in general. - But I love this movie and in a huge part due to all the things people seem to hate. I was surprised and mostly pleasently and went with it. How exciting to shift the focus to new characters and make them crux of the drama rather then hinge on expected revelations, loved the death of snoke not because I like wanted him dead but when it happened I loved that scene and the lead up to it... (like genuine drama in star wars? i thought it couldn't happen anymore) and completly driven by character dynamics. and it's not without flaws, it's too long and some plot twists and parts of narrative (the peripheral ones mostly) are too convenient and too cute, some points too hamfisted, jokes seem to, at times, interfere with a serious nature of some scenes, the sort of unorthodox (for sw) ticking clock premise (running out of fuel)... how ballsy... not very star wars-y but didn't mind that (it was like a submarine hunt or something). But now I'm really excited for new episode and how they're gonna resolve the story, which I was not, comming out of force awakens, really... and I like that movie even thou it's too derivative but that was kind of a point of it. So for me it's 8/10 but to balance the force I have to give it a perfect rating as to mitigate the overblown negativity it's recieving.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson takes the viewer on a two and a half hour slow walk through what looks and sounds like the star wars universe but is actually something more akin to an episode of Babylon 5 or Battlestar Gallactica.<br/><br/>Some truly awful new characters and locations including an atrocious sequence on a casino planet that has come straight from the worst parts of the prequels including<br/>appalling CGI animals and children that can't act and completely misplaced social commentary. Its like they put an advert for PETA in the middle of this movie.<br/><br/>Lets start with the main problem of this movie. It goes nowhere. We start the movie with the opening text telling us the First Order now dominant in the galaxy<br/>despite the starkiller base having been destroyed and we end the movie with the First Order in charge of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Kylo Ren begins as a whiny brat and ends as a whiny brat. Rey begins as an all powerful jedi (somehow !) and ends as the only remaining all powerful jedi because<br/>she now has the ancient jedi books or something.<br/><br/>There is no progression of any character whatsoever in this movie. The new characters introduced are dull and uninteresting and the old legacy characters<br/>such as Luke (Mark Hamill you were right to fundamentally disgree with everything done to your character) and Chewbacca are given deeply unsatisyfing send offs or are pushed to the background.<br/><br/>The movie seems like Rian Johnson was just throwing ideas at the wall and whatever stuck became the story. Where was lawrence kasdan. Where was the lucasfilm<br/>story group to reign in these terrible storylines that are completely outside the established star wars universe.<br/><br/>The worst part of Episode 8 however is that it builds no sense of expectation or excitement going to Episode 9. There is literally no point to the last part of this sequel trilogy. Who is the audience supposed to be rooting for ?? what storyline are we excited by ???? Rey an impossibly perfect character we care nothing about. Kylo ? the now completely irredeemable whiny brat character ? Some secondary background characters like Finn and Rose ?? Leia is the only legacy character left and she cant be in Episode 9 now that Carrie Fisher is gone ?? Just a terrible movie that has killed the sequel trilogy dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke was so off character, non of his actions or words resemble the teachings of obi wan and yoda (jedi).<br/>Living on some rock waiting to die. Luke and Snoke die so meaningless deaths, at least they should let Luke and Snoke fight in some epic fight, and if one of them die i can live whit that but this. kylo ren is just so bad character like my friend say<br/>"i could come and slap him" he have no charisma or aura of fear or respect around him,<br/>when you see vader and palpatin you could feel the dark side and Rey why was she in this movie she feels more like filler character lol</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie is full of plot holes, inconsistencies, wild leaps of logic and many instances of "out of character" behaviour. There's few action scenes that are both well made and serve a purpose in the overall plot. In particular, there's one action scene in the second half of the movie featuring multiple combatants engaged in melee, that is literally and figuratively, a toy commercial that serves no purpose in the plot whatsoever. Very disappointing movie. Good special effects and music and passable acting are the only positives.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I don't know how they managed produce not that bad movie in general (if you don't take into account original trilogy and ep.

This movie looks like Fast&Furious was made by Michel Bay in Star Wars setting with a lot of unnecessary moments, illogical actions and a lot of clichés. Also Disney went over the top with these cute robots and crappy-eyed birds, it really became so annoyed (please don't buy your kids toys and merch with new SW creatures, don't support Disney). So, this is not bad movie, if you haven't seen SW before, but very bad experience for SW fans (even worse than loot crates BFII for me personally).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Even though JJ Abrams was Executive Producer on The Last Jedi.  His vison was easily lost from TFA (which I wasn't a huge fan of but he left a lot of interesting plot points, literally gave the next person (Hack Rian Jonshon) a lay up to make a really awesome film). So many plot holes to count. They ruined lukes character and didn't develop any of the new ones as well.  Kylo basically gives a big F U to the crowd with his dialogue in Snokes throne room (Speaking through the hack Rian Johnson).  Honestly I get moving on from the past Saga, sure, but we all know Disney will make a million movies. So just make these last 3 good (well 2 now, well 1 now that this one is horrible) and then they can do what the want with the franchise.  They could have made their money and made a good film, but they didn't.  Too much humor in serious scenes.  I came in wondering a few questions. Who are Ray's parent?  Who is Snoke? Who are the Knights of Ren? How did Maz get Luke's Lightsaber? Just to name a few.  Zero answered.  I went in with 0 answers or expectations.  Got zero answers and lost all expectations.  Also, to those that say we are all complaining that TFA was too close to a new hope and this one was too far from the OT.  Well they stole most of everything from ESB and RTOJ in this movie.  Oh, except the slow speed spaceship chase.  No matter what I say you'll see it cause it Star Wars but I hope once you do you'll join the rebellion and try and get a film we deserve.

I think the best way to do so is by considering the movie in 2 different ways. Hence I'll be talking about TLJ as a movie, and second I'll be talking about TLJ as part of the SW legacy. Let's begin with saying that Unfortunately the R. Johnson movie fails to deliver in both of these aspects.<br/><br/>TLJ as a MOVIE:<br/>Sadly the movie is flowed with several and fatal mistakes.<br/>1) THE PACING. This movie is the longest in the franchise (152 min. long), despite of this it totally fails to deliver a smoth crescendo of rythm. Expecially in the first half  TLJ will put the viewer against very long and static senes such as the slow FO-Resistence chase or the Luke-Rei-on-an-island plot. Both of these start way to slow and never begin to grow, untill the last thirty minutes of the movie. The result of this is that TLJ feels way longer then it should be, and that fails to keep the viewer engaged for all its entireness.<br/>2) THE HUMOR. Star Wars movies have always been (also) about humor and comic relief characters. TLJ makes absolutely no difference on this behalf. Overall, comic moments are fine, characters like BB-8 or Porgs really manage to snach a smile out of anyone. The real problem lays in the abuse of these moments out of some pivotal scenes that end up with losing all of their charm. Moments like the "put-something-on" scene really manages to kill all the spirit and emotional meaning of Rei-Kilo connection. The Poe-Hux gag at the begining of the movie is by far too long and makes both characters look more stupid then they should ever have looked. Even worse, the moment when Rei hands Luke his father's longtime lost lightsaber, the same scene J.J. Abrams perfectly set up at the end of TFA, is completely ruined by Luke sudden reaction to throw it away that completely kills it.<br/>3) THE PLOT. For all these, and many other reasons, the plot really struggles to stay together. The script fails to feel meaningful in any moment, the entire 40 min long Canto Bight plot could have simply been removed entirley if only vice-admiral Holdo had bothered to communicate with the rest of the Resistence her plan all togheter. After a too-long part of the plot were Luke refuses to train Rei, he promises her 3 lessons and actually delivers just 2 of them. And the list continues. This feels even worse if you think how rushed senes like the final Luke-Kilo confrontation look.<br/><br/>TLJ as part of SW legacy:<br/>Sadly is right here that TLJ totally falls apart.<br/>All of the old characters are severly belittled. Leia becomes a sort of Wonderwoman-like figure who feels so unconnected to her value as the leader of the Resistence (The leading role for most of the movie is actually taken by vice-admiral Holdo). They wanted to make her look strong in the Force, they just managed to make her feel unapropriate. On this note, I have no idea how they could resolve Leia's character now that Carrie left us, She will probably be even more meaningless in Episode IX.<br/>Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C3PO have been reduced to such a little screentime, to make them look just like cameos for fans, that actually important characters to the plot. I strongly got the feeling that Disney is trying to marginalize them for unkown reasons.<br/>Even new characters like Rei and Kilo fail to develop. All of Episode VII references to Ren Knights and Rei's Parents have been completely removed from this movies. Emblematic in this sense is Snoke who dies a shameful death and fails to cope with fans expectations on his true identity.<br/>By far the worst work was made with Luke. He was the brightest hope of the Galaxy, he was THE JEDI, the man who managed to bring back Vader from the dark side, the man who saw hope and light even where there was almost none. He was reduced to a coward heremit who refuses his place into the galaxy. On this behalf, Johnson looked disrespectful to the lore of SW, failing to convey a meaningful reason for this change, again the scene where he throws the lightsaber felt like a punch in the gut to all of long-time SW fans.<br/>Also the Role of the Force of Siths and Jedi have been questioned. Disney is tryin really hard to make the Brand advance into a more "democratic" vision of the Force where there are no heroes, just everyday guys who make the right decisions for the people they love (Rose character is emblematic in this sense). The big mistake is rappresented by the way this has been implemented. By simply throwin into the Sarlac's pit 40 years of tradition between the Dark Side and the Brightside. Also this change fails to happen in the movie couse dispite what they say, Rei and Kilo still pretty much fall into the Jedi-Sith stereotype, they just seem not to like it at all.<br/>Eventually the transition between Lightsabers to broomsticks at the end of the movie, is not something any fan wanted to see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7924859"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I can't believe so many fans loved it, it felt like they were trolling original trilogy (and even Force Awakens) fans to me. The way they treated old characters, Ackbar, R2, and even Luke felt deliberately disrespectful. The whole movie felt like a big middle finger to me. Do you like Ackbar? Too bad, here's some random edgy woman with purple hair for no apparent reason. Oh, and apparently we can lightspeed into other ships now? Why didn't that ever happen in the older movies? Also, why does Luke want to murder his nephew when he wanted to risk everything to save his father for the same reasons?<br/><br/>Even if you can look past those things as a general movie goer, I just can't see how this movie constitutes an objectively good movie (other than on a purely superficial level only). I understand that some Star Wars movies had plot holes but this movie was literally riddled with obvious ones that broke the immersion for me. We can't kill ships from behind now (#Whathappenedtotiefighters and #thebigasscanontheyhadoncrate)? Why didn't Holdo tell Po her plans? Why didn't Po know who Holdo even was? Why bother have Benicio del Toro rat out the rebels plans when Snoke can literally see the transports out his window? Why did Benicio del Toro wait until Finn/Rose arrived to break out of prison? Why was Po able to single-handedly disable all of the dreadnaught's weaponry before they launched tie fighters? Everything done in this movie was done for short term entertainment value at the cost of consistency. Plot twists, plot twists, plot twists! You didn't predict anything coming, that means we're good at making a story! What they forget is that consistency, namely the rules of "what's possible," and trust are very important in a fantasy setting. Consistently trick me and eventually actions and their consequences will lose all meaning. Let magic like the force, ship shielding, or lightspeed(or whatever sci-fi elements available) do things they've never done before and you essentially push the limits of the pre-established rules of the Star Wars universe. Stretch those rules too much and eventually it may feel like actions have unrelated consequences, it allows for writers/directors to pretty much do whatever they want with great convenience. The audience starts to see a pattern of "anything goes" ala Harry Potter style and  suddenly you find the director/writers scrambling to write themselves OUT of the corner they wrote themselves into. Each power given in one scene for convenience may need to be taken out of another scene - for convenience. If a character becomes too powerful you may have to find ways to counteract their powers: you can't trap a character that can teleport unless you come up with some convenient plot device that suddenly stops the character from teleporting. And that's the problem with The Last Jedi- it establishes technology and powers that invalidate the rules already established (ex: why didn't they use lightspeed on the death star). You can't have a ship lightspeeding through whole fleets- it's too powerful and will need to be written out of episode 9 by some counter technology. Every time they come up with a new outrageous power/tech it stretches our suspension of disbelief. It may be fantasy/sci-fi but it still needs rules to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Anyways, if those things weren't bad enough, the overall story is just poor. The 2 hours of running out of gas and failed subplots of Finn and Rose amounted to a story pretty much about running. What's the message? **** happens and sometimes you do more harm than good? Unless you're Rey of course, you can't do any wrong even when handing yourself to your enemy. Also, everyone hates the rebels and you have absolutely no friends to help you out. How small is this galaxy exactly? Oh yeah, blowing up 5 planets in Force Awakens isn't  grounds for a rebellion but Luke becoming a "legend" by astral projecting is enough to rally the children? Sounds like every heroic action in these movies is pointless unless you're a jedi. Also, from Finn's and Po's perspective, they've literally done more harm than good and maybe they shouldn't have even tried at all. There's some lessons to be learned but the movie is confused in conveying it. Reprimand Po for his impulsiveness but then cheer him on later for the same traits. Have Finn waste time looking for a hacker and fight off against his nemesis only to get thousands of people killed. Oh, and apparently rebels are as bad as the First Order because they buy weapons from the same people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Other than this though, I loved it, all of the actors give fantastic performances (especially Mark Hamill), the old & new characters are all great and there are a lot of unexpected turns here as well. Production quality is as good as you would expect with Disney budgets and there were some very nice practical effects here too. If I have any other criticisms (apart from the aforementioned scenes) it would be the pacing, I think the fleet chase lasted too long and the film seems to slow down quite a bit during Finn & Rose's side story.  I think Rian Johnson took a lot of risks here and it has split the fan base as half of the people I know hated it half loved it. For me it's not the best Star Wars film but it's also far from the worst (remember Attack of the Clone people lol)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I stand by that. It is a film about disappointment, but not itself one. It is about tragic mistakes, and the inevitable betrayal of life that is that immortal truth: all things must change, and die. And we either accept change, or become tyrants, great or small, to prevent it.<br/><br/>It celebrates what we love about Star Wars as entertainment, but is not afraid, by embracing the underlying philosophy of what Star Wars represents as MORE than mere entertainment, to then burn all of that to the ground. Because it must.<br/><br/>FULL SPOILERS follow.<br/><br/>Why did the paragon of good consider killing Ben Solo? And why is Rey so powerful if she isn't a Skywalker, or otherwise "special?" Those questions are answered, but are also not the point.<br/><br/>As Yoda tells Luke, there was nothing in the Jedi traditions that Rey did not already have within her. This despite her not apparently having any special lineage. This, solely because of her choices, and because the Force wills it.<br/><br/>People don’t want to hear this, but I’m going to say it because I am convinced of its essential truth:  people over time have forgotten what George Lucas' original intent with Star Wars was. Much like Luke lost his way once beyond the idealistic confines of his heroic youth. (If you believe The Last Jedi "ruined Star Wars," ironically because of Luke's characterization in part no doubt, I'm talking directly about you. Yes, you.)<br/><br/>Star Wars was never about midichlorian counts and force powers or even lightsaber duels.<br/><br/>No. It was about a small group of rebels defying a fascist empire. It was about previous generations' failures and their conflicts with the next generation to follow them (the people they failed, be it their students, or their children - or a whole generation in the abstract.) It was about hope, and how the unlikeliest people can change the course of history. It was also about a mystical force that binds all life together, and about the need to LET GO - to be selfless - instead of trying to CONTROL AND PRESERVE all things, in order to be one with it. (A great irony of this fandom.)<br/><br/>In case people missed one of the major points of the prequels (in fairness, in part because it was poorly communicated): Despite all his hyped up "highest midichlorian count I've ever seen in a life form" potential, his hubris, greed, and tragic fall destroyed Anakin Skywalker. His "special space bloodline" did not save him, or the galaxy.<br/><br/>It was only a choice he made in the end that saved the galaxy, NOT his bloodline or his midichlorians. There is a reason for that. George Lucas’ story is not elitist, but rather, egalitarian. The midicholorians, while canonically relevant, were THEMATICALLY a red herring, and a CAUTIONARY TALE. People missed that, apparently.<br/><br/>The prequels were also the story of a Democracy dying due to apathy and greed, and how good people turn bad. It was NOT the story of a "chosen one" whose blood made him stronger than others (or did you forget he was defeated in a rather Faustian manner by someone with a perfectly ordinary "midichlorian count" in Obi-Wan?)<br/><br/>Lucas' point and intent was to say: none of that stuff matters if you're a selfish person willing to side with someone like Sidious. But the message people got instead, unfortunately, was: Anakin being born of the Force and having an unparalleled midichlorian count are what makes him special, and therefore all subsequent protagonists must be similarly special and elite in some way in order to be powerful, or nothing makes sense and Star Wars is broken. (And by extension, his son Luke must also be without flaw, apparently.)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, unlike Anakin, Obi-Wan and Yoda - both with canonically lower midichlorian counts - recognized their failures and changed because of them, going on to be great heroes because of their humility. And Luke, with minimal training next to Vader, had the wisdom to throw down his lightsaber and reject hate, even if it meant his death. (At least, the Luke of 30+ years ago did. People change. But I digress...)<br/><br/>That was the point. That was Lucas’ message: Be selfless, resist evil, and anyone can be a hero, even if they aren't "chosen ones." THAT IS STAR WARS.<br/><br/>To say Rey cannot be a hero unless she is a Skywalker or Kenobi or Force messiah is the OPPOSITE of the philosophy of Star Wars. And, ironically, it's exactly that point to which Rian Johnson has returned. TLJ shows us things we don't like, but need to accept - much like Luke & Rey. That our heroes aren't perfect. That people change and make mistakes even after great triumphs. That the old must give way to the new, or the old becomes oppressive. That your bloodline doesn't make you powerful (or weak,) your choices do. That heroes and hope continue to rise even in the midst of pervasive darkness. That was the point of the stable boy with the broom at the end, by the way. And that was also, ultimately, THE POINT OF STAR WARS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

What a lack of creativity and rhythm (the exact opposite of the very first Star Wars). What the heck?! It seems like a dummy algorithm wrote the plot of this movie. Princess Leia's floating half-death in the deep space is one of the most outrageous scene in the entire history of cinema: so ridiculous. Luke Skywalker's dyed hair and brand new cut just in occasion of his last lightsaber duel could be the second one. Rose is one of the most unnecessary and annoying character in entire galaxy after the creation of Jar Jar Binks (God saves his soul) .

There is no need for me to reveal spoilers, because every other negative review on metacritic is 100% correct in its critique of this film. Disney has destroyed the Star Wars series and its obvious the movie is geared towards selling more merchandise than it is for building an actual storyline.<br/><br/>If James Franco ever wants to make a sequal for The Disaster Artist, he should make it about Disney and Rian Johnsons piss poor attempt at making a Star Wars film. Best way to summarize my feelings "Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me." Only way Disney could get me to see this next one is to let Christopher Nolan direct it, even then I'd still be hesitant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I really wanted to like this movie. The acting was fine, the special effects also fine. It was the story and the dialogue that let the movie down and Rian Johnson has to take responsibility for this. He may have made Disney a lot of money and attracted some new fans to Star Wars but he may have alienated the fan base for good. Star Wars has always made a effort to present a diverse cast and this is to be commended but Disney make it look like a tick box exercise rather than an integrated, natural progression.  Finally, the movie missed a huge opportunity to use Luke Skywalker properly.  Mark Hamill should be at the centre of the movies going forward.  Rey, Finn and Poe are solid characters but none of them come close to Luke, Han and Leia.  Johnson and Disney have stuffed up but it will take several months for this to be widely accepted.  The professional critics are not the Star Wars fanbase.  The critics will move on to the next movie soon but the discontent amongst fans will continue.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

First, although I truly appreciated some of the stunning visuals and felt that women were rightly given prominent positions in the story, it was the problems relating to the story itself that leads me to conclude this a lackluster outing in the Star Wars cinematic universe. Some of the greatest moments of joy while watching Star Wars The Force Awakens was the challenge to viewers that there were undoubtedly mysteries and plots to be had in the follow ups. I absolutely agree that no viewer should be upset if their favored theory does not come to fruition in a sequel like The Last Jedi but this was not even the case in this situation. Instead, Rian Johnson, the director decided that it would be best to simply throw out any potential twists or plot developments altogether in  critical points in the movie numerous times. This ordinarily would be fine, if the previous film had not essentially promised and marketed the potential for exhilarating and thought provoking twists and plot developments. Admittedly it has only been a few days since the release of TLJ and more official reaction may come out, but the response by RJ and Disney so far has been to either ignore that there may be issues with the product they have produced, or paint it as a more vocal minority of viewers causing the shift toward negative reviews. Quite frankly it just comes off as Disney shouting Fake News in order to discredit real issues with this product. They will undoubtedly make money off of this film and there is nothing wrong with that. But hopefully Disney and Rian Johnson can realize it costs them nothing to admit they may not have produced as solid a cinematic film as they are currently portraying it to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It isn't a bad made movie per say but Story and characters wise it was so off I got the impression that sometimes I was watching an entirely new but less entertaining saga.Plus nothing felt earn in it..aside from some nice visuals and action scenes there is not much there I enjoyed.<br/><br/>Spoiler----<br/><br/>If you are still reading my post and wanna know why I am so disappointed just look at the following and  tell me if i am wrong to be. - we still don't understand what the hell is the first order, whence they come and how they rose up to preeminence?<br/>-How the resistance came about to be ,why there is even one?<br/>-Where does Snoke come from? why is he so powerful? and how...can kylo kill him so easily knowing how powerful he is..like i am still scratching my head over this.<br/>-What is Rey's origin and why is she so powerful?(stating her parents are nobodies does not answer that a tiny bit)<br/>-Why Kylo turn to the dark side<br/>who and where are the knight of Ren? -How comes Finn has been able to escape from his conditioning as a Storm trooper.<br/>Why does Luke refuse to go back to help the resistance after he gave a map to R2D2 so that the resistance can find him ? How comes he cannot feel the force in Rey when he first see her?<br/>why would Luke even try to kill his young nephew when he is not even able to kill his dad (Darth Vader) who was the most evil villain beside the emperor we have ever witnessed and the almost perfect embodiment of darkness. Why would he wanna leave the whole galaxy without Jedi to protect it knowing evil is still around just because he got upset.<br/>Why would Finn try to leave the resistance knowing that Rey will come back after he's been ready to sacrifice his life for her three times?<br/>How does it happen that Finn can fight Captain Phasma so easily without any training and having been kicked his ass by a less ranked Stormtrooper.<br/>Why is kylo so obsessed with Rey without even knowing her ?<br/>How comes lea has power now?<br/>Why can Luke touch lea and lea touch him when no one is able to touch him, even kylo ?<br/>How come Snoke is killed in the second movie????<br/>why make a movie that doesn't follow the plot laid in the former one ?<br/>what was the point of Finn and Rose arc ?<br/>What about kilo training? nothing?<br/>What about Rey Training? nothing?<br/>Why make Luke a coward ?<br/>is Rey stronger than luke? how comes she is able to mate him?...come on guys!!<br/><br/>See this movie can't save itself and to me Ryan Johnson just butchered star wars.Sure the prequels have problems and lots of them.Everyone can acknowledge that but this is just awful.Ryan johnson wasn't the man for the job he should have been given an entire new trilogy all for himself.Putting him in this one was a big mistake. He just ruins the all thing to me with his poor choices. Praising that film as the new empire strike back is a definitively a non sense to me. maybe i missed something but That movie was a failure to me.But that is just my opinion though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

How is it possible to make some of the most ingenious and inspired scenes in SW universe and then cut to uninteresting cliche riddled rubbish.  Basically this movie is an amalgamation of two films, one about rebellion and one about force, that are linked only by a flimsiest thread and sometimes visual reminders.<br/>I loved one for the thought provoking ideas and visuals, and hated the other for utter lack of anything interesting (aside from possibly some slick CGI). Fynn is now utterly useless failure. Poe is a standard hot headed, wise cracking good guy, we have seen in most movies since the 80s. And Rose is just an exposition and punchline setup mechanism. Am I being too harsh? Think of the movie without them, does the resolution change much? Exactly!<br/><br/>That being said, this 2 and a half hour movie is actually worth it, for that one superior 40+minutes film.

The greatest hero in cinema history reduced to a bitter, cowardly man. This movie is a slap in the face to anyone who loved the Star Wars trilogy. Thanks for absolutely ruining Luke, Rian. Must feel good that with a swipe of your brush you negated 40 years of imagination. I am so happy that real fans are honestly reviewing this movie and bringing down the cume. I’ve read a lot of reviews saying this new trilogy is “not for us, its for the kids and my kids loved it.” Well, guess what, when the prequels came out, the kids loved them too. Speaking of, I would rather watch any of the prequels INCLUDING Menace than to watch Last Jedi again. At least they FELT like Star Wars movies. Rian, how did you make a saga movie with Luke, Leia, Chewie and more OG’s and make it NOT feel like Star Wars? That is an amazing feat but you did it. Congratulations. You were so concerned about doing something different and edgy that you completely missed the point. FUN. JOY. ADVENTURE. HOPE. RESPECT for the source. This movie sucks and for the first time in my life I am not looking forward to another installment in the trilogy. Not at all. I don’t care anymore. Thank you Rian.  #NotMyLuke</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I am a star wars fan, and was very excited about the new movie. But after about 30 minutes the movie started, the expectations from the movie went down. Overall visuals, OST and actors' performance is on a top level, no doubt; but the overall movie plot does not make any sense. My only hope for this movie is, that the directors are "collecting" all the cool stuff to be filmed in the final episode, and then maybe it would make sense.<br/><br/>Here is a list of things I wanted to point out (spoilers):<br/>- Kylo was not able to shoot at the cruiser, where was his mother: this was very emotional and heartbreaking part, but after seeing Leia performing a "Superman stunt" was a total buzzkill.<br/>- Was afraid that the movie would end the moment Luke confronts Kylo, but now I guess it would be a good cliffhanger than having Luke killed in a some strange way<br/>- Luke Skywalker fighting Kylo Ren was kinda cool, but the "Ghost Jedi" thing was a bit unnecessary imho.<br/>- Was expecting some revelations about Snoke & Rey - Who they are, and where they come from. My only hope is that these would be revealed in the final chapter.<br/>- The only thing that was keeping entertained was the porgs part: silly creatures stealing attention to not dive into details.<br/><br/>Overall I am very disappointed about this movie, just hope that it was all done in purpose - to make final episode awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Starts with rebel base being attacked, then they are chased through space... then they go and meet the new not like-able Lando-ish character which of course betrays them. And then finally we get new variation from Empire Strikes Back only to have a throne room scene where the new emperor character (who coincidently has the greatest weakness of overconfidence... just like Palpatine) gets killed (albeit this was a good scene). Then kylo wants Rey to rule galaxy with him. Then massive plot hole of hyperdrive and hunk of metal.. uh Rian... you do realize you just put a super weapon in the hand of every bloke with a hyperdrive and a droid they tell to fly to their death right???

Throughout the film, I was surprised to find, that the director/script/Disney brain-trust, wanted me to F- myself. Over and over. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing:<br/><br/>You want a continuation of the story-line from episode 7? F- yourself.<br/><br/>You want to see Luke Skywalker go on another swashbuckling adventure? F-yourself.<br/><br/>Do you want to see answers given to the mysteries set-up in episode 7? Too bad. The mysteries are stupid and it all doesn't mean anything and go F-yourself.<br/><br/>I have never been so insulted, humiliated, and embarrassed, from watching a major film from a beloved franchise. The message seems to be loud and clear: if your an older fan of Star Wars, you don't matter anymore and you shouldn't love Star Wars because it all doesn't mean anything... Well, it means something to me! I love Star Wars, and I cannot fathom how this movie got made. It's a travesty. Poor Mark Hamil. He deserved much better than this hot pile of garbage called The Last Jedi.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The reaction in the theater when Rey and Kylo team up was awesome. Probably the best fight in all of Star Wars movies ever. People went wild. When Luke stands in front of the AT-ATs was also very well received. It has some pretty cool scenes. Porgs and Crystal Foxes are great. BB-8 was great. It definitely had some awesome moments and visuals. Some of the humor was spot on. That said some aspects of this movie do not make sense if you think too much about them (Hyperdrive attacks??). Other parts such as Leia using the force look cheap and should be digitally remade / shot (She looks a bit like Mary Poppins). But as a fun film, it is pretty good. If you just want a fun movie and not overly concerned with the lore, this movie will be a lot of fun. I love Star Wars (Legends, Universe, old Canon, new Canon, etc), but my wife is not into it. Yet, she really liked this movie. I think that is the reaction of the average casual viewer.There are also a lot of things that are not what they seem and will be better understood in Episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I am sure if this script was not backed by Disney nor part of the SW family, it would have gotten a less stellar reception.  Far too many attempts at creating subplots, especially subplots that is irrelevant to the story.  Even the prequels had better attempts at plot twists vs this.  The idea that a uber powerful villain that should have had a back story that stretches prior to the prequels (given his assume age) should have been similar as Palpatine and not be killed so inconsequentially. Luke persona in the SW universe would never have tried to kill his sleeping nephew nor would have fallen into that state of depression. As powerful as Anikin was with the force, he still needed years of training and he still had his arm chopped off. How is it that Rey reads the cliff notes version and becomes an expert?<br/><br/>I have far more issues with the film but will run out of space. No way is this equal to the tight story that empire was.  If you know Mass Effect, this makes me feel the same way as I did after playing all 3 games and then got the middle finger from EA with the 3rd ones' original ending.<br/><br/>SW is not the SW of our youth as much as you hope it will be.  It has been commercialized like a modern pop star. It lacks the vision and storytelling of the originals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7921042"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">A lot of visual and production effort utterly wasted on a story that isn't just poor, but actively stamps on the original movies. So I've been thinking. What was the point of this movie? Other then stomping over the mystery boxes of JJ Abrams. I mean they spent 4 billion dollars on just buying Star Wars, let alone all the other costs. How the **** does Disney not have a ****ing plan? This is supposed to be three movies to cover a story. I expected, the TLJ to expand on characters and explain events in a cohesive narrative that sets up the next instalment. But instead it explains nothing and doesn't advance the "plot" at all, just meanders around for 2 and half hours.<br/><br/>So let's look at the character arcs.<br/><br/>Finn. When I mentioned in my first post How I don't hate any of the characters, other then Rose and Luke, just pity them, Finn was chief in my mind. But of course it wasn't just this movie. Across two movies he has been criminally mishandled. So the core concept is great. Brainwashed Enemy Soldier that switches sides and fights for the good guys. But they immediately just trash it. I think one of my core reasons why I hated Rey so much more in Force Awakens that this, is because she and Finn were seperated. They seem to bring out the worst in each other. Finn acts like a cowardly moronic comic relief character while Rey is a turbo **** to him.<br/><br/>Finn Is Better in Last Jedi. But he clearly had nothing to do, so they give him a completely useless sub plot that is hamfisted and gets more rebels killed. And a tacked on romance, that I felt zero chemistry from. One that ends up throwing him literally off course from saving the rebels, to be smashed into the ground to be told done trite **** by Rose. **** Rose.<br/><br/>So what was the point? He had no character growth. Getting a girlfriend isn't character growth. Having another rematch with useless Chrome Lady Stormtrooper isn't character growth.<br/><br/>Poe. So he had a character arc. Too bad it was a ****ing stupid one. What is his lesson? Don't worry if your commander sounds like a moron in a evening dress who has no idea what they are doing and is just bleating trite nothing ****. No just obey orders and go like a sheep to the slaughter. Or that the rebellion is so ****ed that trading a collection of the worst bombers ever and a few star fighters for a massive ship is bad.<br/><br/>Poe seems to be largely rooted in having nothing much to do with him. Hell I'm not even sure if he was supposed to survive the Force Awakens. It felt like he died, and then was written back in at a later point because we need a cocky rogue.<br/><br/>The Mutiny is pointless ****, that could have been solved by anybody ****ing communicating. Hell the movie seems to love abusing him. Leia slapping him. Getting mocked for being demoted just for asking if they had a ****ing plan. Then Leia ****ing stuns him for a laugh from the audience. Why? He clearly idolises her. She could have just said "hey I have a plan, stop your mutiny".<br/><br/>Of course the movie also contained a perfectly arc that they squandered. Simple. Have Leia die. Boom. The hot headed flyboy, used to commanding a small squad in battle is now left in command of the rebellion in retreat. Every instinct screams turn and fight. But he can't. He struggles to command. Everything seems doomed. And then Leia appears as a force ghost to give a small Obi Wan in the trench style, advice in time for him to pull a way out.<br/><br/>Now Rey. The Mary Sue stuff is still there, but she and the writers are being less ****y about it. But she doesn't have a arc. She has parental angst in a mystery box, and then lol nobody drunks . Which isn't a bad idea in its lonesome ( but does ruin her defenders 'Muh secret force training' defense). But it isn't a arc in itself. Then she has weird connection with Kylo and force. But what. We are told she is tempted. Not shown it. She doesn't give in and do anything bad. She doesn't really do anything. She was just a pawn between Snoke and Kylo. Snoke thinks he is using her, but actually she was being used by Kylo to slay Snoke and kill his guards.<br/><br/>Kylo. He started the movie conflicted, freshly humiliated and why he was dabbling in the dark side unanswered. And he ends the movie conflicted, freshly humiliated, why he was dabbling in the dark side unaswered and in command. That isn't a character arc. He isn't going good. He isn't getting worse, as he couldn't take out Leia. He isn't less conflicted. Maybe he is a bit more conflicted.<br/><br/>The main hint of a arc is taking his Vader hero worship with the helmet, and smashing it to bits. But that was one scene, and It felt more winking at the audience then coherent plotting. Hey look this guy is still crazy and out of control. Lol.<br/><br/>But where are they supposed to take him? Redeem him? Kill him?<br/><br/>Hell What does he want? Why is he a Space school shooter? What is he even going to do with the first order's fleet?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A lot like Suicide Squad and the first Star Wars prequels, in that regard.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>1) Every "Mystery Box" element from The Force Awakens is cheaply thrown away, making that movie a far lesser experience. Knowing that this dismissive "Who cares?!?" is the answer to all those questions from that movie, there is now no reason to care about most of that movie at all.<br/><br/>2) Every political and historical point in the previous movie (and entire series) is thrown away. The entire concept of a Galaxy-wide Republic is forgotten, and three capital ships and a ridiculously-stupid fleet of "bombers" are apparently the sum total of vessels willing to oppose the First Order. This is made all the worse in that this pathetic "Resistance" keeps forgetting to call itself a Resistance, and keeps inaccurately mislabeling itself as a Rebellion instead.<br/><br/>3) Speaking of dismissively throwing away history without a single word: Admiral Ackbar<br/><br/>4) The Resistance's bombers are quite possibly the most ridiculously useless spaceships seen anywhere in this franchise. Y-Wings did the job a dozen times better, by not being ponderous sitting ducks without defensive weapons, and also by not being silly rube-goldberg devices that take multiple minutes to arm and drop a payload.<br/><br/>5) The goofy, two-hour Battlestar Galactica chase has so many plot holes. Why doesn't the First Order call in reinforcements to surround the fleeing ships? Why doesn't the First Order warp some ships ahead to surround the fleeing ships? Why doesn't the First Order maintain ships in orbit of Krayt to shoot at rescue ships coming in (like the Millennium Falcon) and escape ships trying to get out (again, like the Millennium Falcon)? Why doesn't the First Order just once again "track through hyperspace" the fleeing Rebels (sorry, RESISTANCE)? The ability of the Millennium Falcon to get in unmolested, putter around close-to-unmolested, and get away without still being tracked makes absolutely Zero sense, given the setup as presented by this film.<br/><br/>The Ugly:<br/><br/>1) Luke Skywalker is willing to be a reluctant book-burner. To show him up, Yoda comes back from death solely to become an ENTHUSIASTIC book-burner.<br/><br/>2) Luke Skywalker's character and memory is violated in almost every conceivable way, up to and including being dismissively thrown away with no clear explanation at all. (Yes, I know that the director has gone around giving explanations about what the heck happened on the Internet. ProTip: if you need to make Internet explanations about what the heck went on in your movie's climax, you have released an incoherent movie.)<br/><br/>3) Snoke is a true idiot, an oblivious can of Diet Palpatine thrown away without any consequence<br/><br/>4) Phasma also means nothing, and continues her unimpressive incompetence from the last movie<br/><br/>5) Last but not least, Leia is Mary Poppins, y'all</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I wasn't really a fan of Force Awakens, but I adored Rogue One and had hoped it was evidence that Disney was finally capable of making a good Star Wars film. Oh goodness, I was wrong! This is a film that was made with no other intention than making as much money as possible from a wide audience and is actively hostile toward people who would call themselves "Star Wars fans." It's willfully ignorant of 40 years of lore and tramples over the source material.<br/><br/>What was wrong with the film? Plot-holes the size of a Death Star. Most notably, the Finn and Rose sub-plot was completely unnecessary to the plot and added to the film's unnecessarily long length. The entire casino setting didn't feel like it belonged in the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>Wasted potential of Snoke. Why should his story bother to be told now that he was killed off so quickly? He was supposed to be at least as powerful as Palpatine and deserved more backstory before he was offed in such a haphazard manner.<br/><br/>Luke acts very differently than he did in the earlier films and extended universe material. He was the ultimate sci-fi hero for four decades and we all wanted to see him operate at the height of his powers after training as a jedi grand-master off-screen for 40 years. How exhilarating was the final Vader scene in Rogue One? Imagine if we got to watch Luke kick some major amounts of behind in a similar manner? What did we get instead? A whiny coward who is nothing like his Return of the Jedi self and tries to kill his own nephew, which was really out of character. More Mary Sue nonsense where advanced force abilities can be used without any training at all and expert saber dueling capabilities can be achieved in no time!<br/><br/>Capital ships running out of fuel? Is this suddenly supposed to be Battlestar Galactica? Light speed kamikaze suddenly being a thing in the first time of the history of Star Wars cinema? Why didn't someone think of that sooner? It could have ended every conflict prior like a super weapon!<br/><br/>Disney got it wrong because they could have still made mountains of cash if they actually made a Star Wars film instead of whatever this garbage was. Instead, all they seem to care about is pushing their ham-fisted social agenda and erasing everything that made Star Wars the beloved franchise it once was. The studio has a lot to fix with Episode 9, but it no longer matters to me, because I won't be giving them my money to watch it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Overall I don't think it a good movie, but further it is a terrible Star Wars movie.  The plot had holes you could drive a truck through, the attempts at jokes and comedy had terrible timing and either fell flat or felt out of place in a Star Wars movie, there was very little character development, and all the build up and mystery developed in the previous movie (The Force Awakens) was disregarded and turned into a big let down.  Luke Skywalker's portrayal was way out of character and to some extent a betrayal to the fans - Luke deserved better.  Finally, from the perspective of the fans, the mythology, lore and "rules" of The Force and Star Wars were ignored or disregarded which made the whole thing hard to accept within the established mythos of Star Wars.  The pace, timing and editing just did not feel like other movies in the series.  I think this is the worst movie in the whole series.  I was concerned when Disney took over, and up until now I thought things would work out as The Force Awakens and Rogue One were pretty good in my opinion, but now I feel like Disney ruined Star Wars by throwing out all the rules and the things at least half of the fan base treasures about Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Screw it. Fire everything. 8) I know there's only about 40 of us left now, but DO NOT TELL POE ANYTHING 9) Excellent death scene for Carrie Fisher - it was sudden, it was shocking and it was sad, just like her real life death... then the director stole that moment from us like the bastard he is. 10 - 40) everything else in everyone else's comments and finally 41) Mark Hamill hates what they did to his most identifiable character. Lets hope Disney doesn't get ahold of the Joker and have him slip on a wet floor and end up in a vegetative state because the Joker 'gets in the way of the new characters story'.

Disney makes Leia into Mary Poppins.  It's just a hot mess, with special effects and an OJ Simpson Van chase.  The dream is dead ladies and gentlemen.  RIP Star Wars franchise.  I don't know if there is anything in heaven or Earth that could cause desire in me to see another Star Wars film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

When exiting the theater I was very confused and dumbstruck at the wasted potential of this film, and how it could have been made to be just as great as the movies from the Original Trilogy. Mark Hamill says it best "In Hollywood — remember kids — it's not important of high quality, but only when it makes money." The Force Awakens, even with a re-hashed story is far more likable than The Last Jedi.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
