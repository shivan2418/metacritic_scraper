Other than the casino part, most of the movie was pretty enjoyable! A few twists were just "okay", and the pacing was kind of weird at times (things happened WAY too fast on a few occasions), but the good outweighs the bad for me. Mark Hamill's acting was top notch in the movie. Definitely better than The Force Awakens. The original trilogy is still the best, but this movie might be right behind them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It was very enjoyable, it was funny as well as dramatic but I feel that the movie, while very beautifully shot and well acted, shoots itself in the foot with a lot of strange decisions. For example (spoilers, duh) the fact that Rose saves Finn from sacrificing himself is so unnecessary. That would have been such a truly dramatically incredible moment, the sort of immature, wisecracking Finn maturing and finding it within himself to sacrifice his life for the greater good. In whole, the entire Rose and Finn story is incredibly boring. The movie stalls in the casino city, and I didn't find myself particularly interested in their supposed romance. It felt kind of rushed and uninspiring. Had they gotten a bit of true good backstory together, like Han and Leia, that would have saved that storyline.<br/>Luke dying I feel totally works. It adds a lot to his character and it is very interesting. The movie is very funny, the "Hugs" part made me laugh a lot, Yodas "Page turners, they were not" was one of the funniest Star Wars lines ever. The movie ranks 4th on my list of my favourite Star Wars movies. The list now looks like this:<br/>Empire Strikes Back<br/>A New Hope<br/>The Force Awakens<br/>The Last Jedi<br/>Rogue One<br/>Return of the Jedi<br/>Revenge of the Sith<br/>The Phantom Menace<br/>Attack of the Clones<br/><br/>(The difference between my enjoyment of Revenge of the sith and return of the jedi is obviously MUCH bigger than the difference between Return and Rogue one. I will forever dislike the prequels)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Beautifully shot. Funny. So much happened in this movie that I felt overwhelmed by the end. Can't wait to see it again and really interested to see where the story will go next.<br/><br/>Rated 10 to balance out all of the ridiculous 0 score reviews. How can you simultaneously complain because the movie wrapped too many story lines up and then  also complain that nothing was resolved in it? I loved how it subverted many of my expectations while still definitely feeling like a Star Wars film - clearly others did not. A core message of this movie (time to let old things go) is something that has hit a nerve with many.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This film is a bloated mess Rian Johnson completely fails to realise that Ep8 is the middle part of a three part sequel trilogy that should continue the previous narrative. Instead all the story threads laid out by Ep7 and the original movies are completely discarded and replaced with toilet humour and not so subtle political speeches about animal welfare, child labor and the evils of the super rich.<br/><br/>Gone are the real world sets and practical effects of EP7 and we are returned to the lifeless CGI worlds that echo the very worst from the prequel era.<br/><br/>The story does nothing for the existing characters and introduces more utterly irrelevant new ones that the audience cares nothing for.<br/><br/>There might be an ok-ish movie buried here somewhere that a more subjective editor could've found by cutting down the running time to around 90minutes and disposing of the terrible subplots like the horrendous casino planet sequence that Rian Johnson introduces. Ultimately this movie is a huge misstep by Disney. If this movie has come through their scrutiny without reshoots then God knows how bad Rian Johnsons new trilogy will be.<br/><br/>At the end of the day You're going to see this movie. You're going to see the Solo movie in May 2018 and you're going to see Ep9. That doesnt mean any of these will be good movies as the whole thing is clearly now just part of the Disney money making machine.<br/><br/>RIP Star Wars. Mark Hamill...You were right to fundamentally disagree with everything done to your character.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As usual, the visual effects are great. Many people have debated if it was a good movie, and if it's hard, then it's not a good movie. The plot was good, not great. The problem with The Force Awakens was it left people too many questions and much confusion. Nobody was like that for the original trilogy, and everyone enjoyed it. Also, some of the major points don't make sense. For example:<br/>-Why Did Luke Die?<br/>-Why Did Luke Change His Mind About Training Rey?<br/>-Will the Jedi Die?<br/>-Why is Rey so Good with the Force?<br/>-Is Snoke Really Dead(like Darth Maul)?<br/>-Did Yoda Use Force Lightning?<br/>-What was the Point of Rey's 'Cave Mirror'?<br/>-Couldn't Finn have used R2-D2 instead of Code Breaker?<br/>-Why wasn't Poe told the Plan to Escape?<br/>-Since When Could Leia use Force Powers?<br/>-Nobody Told Rey Size Didn't Matter when it's the Force.<br/>-Why are Porgs there?<br/>-Why Did DJ Betray Finn?<br/>-Was This Movie Just Copying the Original Movies?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm fine with them doing something different, but I do expect a well-crafted, engaging story that at least respects what came before.

But the rest of it just felt so-so and quite static, chiefly because most of the movie revolves around the slowest getaway since OJ - everyone on board HMS Exposition limping along and trying to do something interesting with their hair while Kylo and the First Order,  with their galaxy bashing faster than light flying machines, can't seem to organise a simple road block.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, far far away on a rock in Kerry, Luke is in a proper snarky mood, Rey gets trippy, and Chewbacca..well...no idea, perhaps he's down the back of the Falcon reading those few books Luke hasn't been arsed to read in 30 years. Who knows.<br/><br/>There's some gubbins about an arms dealer: apparently, the First Order have more financial clout than the rebels which is why they have better weapons. I'm not sure I follow the logic here, did they buy the Starkiller base or outsource it? Perhaps episode IX is going to be about someone hacking Hux's email to reveal who's funding the First Order.<br/><br/>Hux. Like the worst Keystone Cops panto villain ever with his pasty face, rouged cheeks and minging eyebrows. Gleeson was pretty good in The Force Awakens, but here there's more ham on display than a Christmas window full of beglittered arses. Snokes is much more interesting this time around, while Kylo still has petulance issues and helmet hair. These bad guys are all utterly incompetent idiots, which makes it really hard to believe they could have so much power; I can see Kylo Ren sending out angry 'no-one-understands-me' 'fake-news' tweets at 3am while snacking down on KFC and Pepsi before he smothers himself in hairspray and poses for some Instagram selfies - the only thing he's conflicted about is which social platform has better filters and reach.<br/><br/>Finn is still the most interesting character in this new batch of films, but his whole input into this episode could be shelved and no one would miss it. There's a real easy going charm to the way he's played, but he's wasted on this occasion.<br/><br/>I'll all for tearing things down to build something new and fresh again and that's where this film wins its only real battle, by laying the groundwork for what's to come. Even though it's tied down to a just a few locations that really aren't that new or interesting there are still some great visuals, just nothing especially creative other than the salt covered planet Crait.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson not only wants to tear down and kick-start a completely new Star Wars, but he really doesn't seem to like anything that JJ Abrams brought to the table with The Force Awakens. It'll be interesting to see what Abrams does when directing the next episode.<br/><br/>The Last Jedi is too long, with a huge amount of yak, and the story is too thin and stretched too far. There's little that's spectacular about it<br/>or particularly clever, and although it does have some good set pieces there's not enough to hit all the bullseyes I expect from this franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson gave this series an incredibly unique direction, that makes this film stand out. All of the arks in this movie are written and pulled off beautifully. There are some definite issues in pacing, for the movie will derail a lot in the first act. This may tie into my last complaint, but I don't like what Finn and the new character Rose are doing in this movie. Finn also doesn't have an ark or any character development, which was disappointing.<br/><br/>I did like The Force Awakens more, by the way. I don't by into a lot of the criticisms and nit picks that people have, because they're stupid. But The Force Awakens move along at a better place, and overall had less problems then The Last Jedi. I still loved this movie, and it is a welcome addition to the 3rd Star Wars Trilogy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Only to spit on its name.<br/><br/>Wow. Just wow. The Last Jedi was the worst piece of garbage masquerading as a Star Wars movie. I genuinely feel bad for paying the ticket fee. This movie doesn't deserve that.<br/><br/>See, I hate it when my favourite things are being destroyed. It's like a phantom dagger piercing my heart.<br/><br/>Why exactly is TLJ such a horrendous farce of a movie? Spoilers, beware. Let's see...<br/><br/>1. No character development. At all. The only thing we learned is that Kylo Ren has conflicts of conscience. Everyone else remains as forgettable, boring PC main characters. Finn is still a black dude who sometimes gets excited. Rey still beat Kylo Ren with her girl powers without actual training. There's a new short, plump, socially awkward girl. Need I say more.<br/><br/>2. The romance between Finn and Rose felt forced. They had zero chemistry at all. The kiss-scene felt like it came out of nowhere. I get that romance is a reoccurring theme in Star Wars, but... just because you can do it, doesn't mean you should. Did they write this on their lunch breaks? Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>3. No tension. You know one ingredient that makes a good movie? Emotions. I may just be cold, but I felt almost ZERO emotions while watching TLJ. There wasn't a single scene that made me excited, hyped, joyous, sorrowful, or angry. The only emotion I felt... was disappointment. I didn't even chuckle once. Speaking of chuckling...<br/><br/>4. Misplaced comedy. Really. I'm not the kind of person to laugh out loud often, but not a single 'comedic' or 'funny' scene even made me smile.<br/><br/>5. What happened with Snoke? He was both a severely underused and cliche villain. It's almost like they tried to recreate the ending of Return of the Jedi when Rey entered Snoke's throne room and was briefly force-tortured by him. Then he dies. Awesome. Honestly, I didn't like him that much either way, but... You have three movies to make a compelling villain. Three movies. Of the most popular fictional saga in the entire world. And THIS is what you come up with?<br/><br/>6. What happened with Captain Phasma? No. I refuse. I REFUSE to believe that was her fate. She'll come back, right? That was just a ruse to make us think that she's dead. There's no **** way that you kill off one of the most underused villains of all time like that. SHE HAD LESS TOTAL SCREEN TIME IN 2 MOVIES THAN GENERAL GRIEVOUS DID IN REVENGE OF THE SITH FOR **** SAKE.<br/><br/>7. Random ass-pulls. Things that make you go "Oh, come oooon!". Princess Leia's 'death' is a shining, prime example of this. Curses, our fair princess was vacuumed into space! Oh wait. She can just use her space wizard powers to move herself back to safety. The movie was full of these mini-deus-ex-machinas, but it would take forever to list them all.<br/><br/>8. Awkward directing and mini-plot holes. So... when Finn and whatshername were captured and prepared for execution by Captain Phasma, there were stormtroopers all around them. An explosion. Everyone except our gracious main characters is dead. What happened to the troops surrounding Finn and Rose? At the end after the crash, how did Finn carry whatsherface back to rebel lines without AT-AT's obliterating them? My god. I admit I was tired, so maybe I missed some key elements. Could someone explain in detail how the main characters survived in some scenes for reasons other than their extraordinarily thick plot armour?<br/><br/>And since this is the 8th 'episode', I think the 8th reason why The Last Jedi is a heap of garbage is a good place to stop. There are, of course, many more things, like Kylo Ren's betrayal of Snoke, Luke's death and Admiral Holdo's hyperspace-suicide which were completely intellect dampening from a logical perspective.<br/><br/>One thing I liked were the Force scenes between Kylo and Rey. Them sensing each other and the camera angles being placed accordingly. Those were pretty sweet. The visual and auditory presentation of Holdo's suicide by hyperspacing through the imperial fleet was really cool. Otherwise, it made no sense lore-wise. Couldn't the rebels just have destroyed all of the Death Stars in the previous movies the same way?<br/><br/>Rogue One was good. Fantastic, even. The Force Awakens was bad. The Last Jedi somehow manages to be even worse. I'd rather watch the prequels three times in a row that have a go at these Disney Wars movies befouling the Star Wars name. I have no hope for Episode 9. Hire better **** writers and directors and maybe we'll see.<br/><br/>Hell, if Disney contacted me, I'd write a compelling, unforgettable script for Episode IX for FREE. I'm dead **** serious.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And I left this one wondering a bit with some sentiment of disappointment.<br/>Overall this movie is a huge pile of mess with some good enjoyable moments scattered here and there.<br/><br/>Things I like:<br/><br/>+  It's quite different than the others taking a slightly different direction in its settings, ideas, and characters. While not all of them hit the right spot, it's enough to keep it interesting and have the viewer curious about what will happen next. + Some of the effects are pretty good, well represented, solid characters and development with some twist and turns here and there.<br/><br/>+ Well done space battles.<br/><br/>+ A few new worlds for those that are interested.<br/><br/>+ Luke Skywalker<br/><br/>+ A nice well-done saber battle around the middle of the movie<br/><br/>Things I dislike:<br/><br/>- Unsatisfying moments, the movie doesn't deliver anything that's impactful enough to leave you with a sentiment of awe, unlike the previous ones.<br/><br/>- Some of the interesting story elements Force Awakens hinted at are either poor answers or they weren't answered at all. A big letdown here and a waste of good story elements that are just suddenly dropped.<br/><br/>- One of the biggest issues I've had with this movie is that it feels like a compilation of smaller Star Wars movies linked together to make this one. The story itself doesn't flow too well and there are a lot of inconsistencies.<br/><br/>- The plot is also forced with an arc parallel to the interesting bit of the story following Finn and a new character that's really unnecessary and kinda pointless in the end.<br/><br/>- Questionable decisions<br/><br/>- Snoke is a letdown and we find out nothing more about him in this movie. So if you're looking out to find out more from him, there's nothing here that will add to it.<br/><br/>- A lot of humor that's thrown in situations that just don't work. They remove the intensity and pressure by making jokes that aren't even that funny.<br/><br/>- Captain Phasma is also a letdown. She probably has as much screen time as she did in Force Awakens with the same amount of lines.<br/><br/>- We find out little to nothing about the story overall though to it's credit we do discover Luke's backstory as well as Ren's. Conclusion:<br/><br/>It's a decent movie, I wouldn't say it's bad but it's a far cry from a praise. I personally loved Star Wars Rogue One and this one falls in comparison which is a shame.<br/>Luckily some of the characters hold up the movie with their well-acted scenes, good cinematography and camera work.<br/>Luke Skywalker is holding up this movie and without him, it would fall even lower.<br/>Overall it's a disappointment for the most part but there's enough in this for people to enjoy.<br/><br/>This one is more comparable to Revenge of the Sith, for some will be lower than Revenge of the Sith and for others, it will probably be a bit higher.<br/><br/>Just don't expect anything outstanding and don't think that some of your questions about Snoke, Finn, Rey and other characters will be answered here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I certainly saw some problems and plot holes, but nothing more than were clearly visible in the original three. Thankfully, at least this movie decided to make all it's own plot holes and mistakes. It brought life to lifeless characters and gave a good death to Luke. While some are clearly upset that it did not meet their predictions, I was thrilled that it met none of mine and left me wondering often just what would happen next. IF this is only a trilogy I am very curious to see just how they will resolve this conflict between two totally rudderless force newbies in only one more film. If it goes more than that, well, I wouldn't mind it at all if they are able to keep things fresh like they did in this instalment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The direction Rian Johnson took the film, left me constantly surprised and on the edge of my seat throughout the film. The journey of new character's as well as our legends is told well, the cinematography is beautiful and the film stays true to Star Wars while taking a bold new direction. Not only is this a good Star Was film, it's a good film in general. I won't dismiss that a few things fall flat, but in a 2.5 hour movie, that's bound to happen. I left the theater smiling and I can't wait for Episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's borderline too much for kids, unlike other the other entries, so be prepared for that.<br/><br/>For all of those with a positive review, definitely agree. Star Wars has never been particularly heavy on plot, rather effects and character driven with wonderful world-building so not saying that's a bad thing. This was heavy on the plot though, analytically it's the first to go into personal motive that isn't just "let's destroy the empire", we're talking about characters with their own personal backstory and ideals that drive them.  It was the first to even ask the question "which person is right here?"(aside from not knowing if Anakin should be a Jedi Master or not, which was forced drama)- so take that as you will, it's just another testament to the fact that the originals were never particularly deep.<br/><br/>It explored human themes like abandonment, loss, failure, and death without giving up the Star Wars charm that we're used to. Again, it easily had the most plot, lore, and most thorough execution of any Star Wars to date- plenty of well-placed fanservice, and overall was like Star Wars if they ever decided to add a heavier, darker plot, more lore, and wanted to increase the characterization to something that wasn't just comedy banter and cheesy smiles.  Again, not saying that's a bad thing.  It explored the full extent of the universe.  Star Wars has always been legendary level, but this took it to the next level and is the standard for the Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre to come: 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Then afterwards we silently ate our dinner processing what we just saw and reflecting on the various twists in the movie and realizing just how disappointing they were. The Force Awakens brought a new universe full of intrigue and excitement, then this movie crushed and ruined that same intrigue and excitement. Although not as bad as the prequel trilogy, it is as good and bad as the specialized editions. Much like the prequel trilogy the over abundance of silly creature and characters are unwanted and out of place, that combined with the out of character decisions and actions by the cast of this film make it one I do not look forward to watching again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Admittedly some work better than others, but amongst the filler there are some great character moments, epic battles and revelations that I'd never have expected. It's not as tightly scripted as the likes of Empire Strikes Back, but as a modern-day Star Wars movie it's certainly one of the better ones.

Green milk dribbling, horrifically pointless side stories (for two hours), two of the worst EVER Star Wars characters (Laura Dern and Rose) - I can go on and on.

When the movie was over still I felt terrible in the theater.<br/><br/>- First of all, the opening. Poe Dameron vs The First Order ships was completely bad writing. As Poe Dameron destroyed the weapons one by one, we saw General Hux watching the events from the his window. And only three Tie-Fighter chases him. Maybe the others watched like a movie.<br/><br/>- The First Order and Resistance's hole chase is completely bad writing, again. We've seen the Star Destroyers moves fast like other ships before. There are dozens of Star Destroyers on the same screen in TLJ and none of them catch the ship.<br/><br/>- While chasing, they said the resistance ship had 13 hours of fuel left. And... At the same time Rey staying two days in the island. So, where is that writers mind?<br/><br/>- The whole Casino scene is destroyes the movie, no doubt. The big pile of the writers. The scene on horseback also horrible, this film is not some Narnia. It's Star Wars.<br/><br/>- Rose... This girl was the worst character of Star Wars, for me. Even the Jar Jar Binks was not so empty and unnecessary, for me.<br/><br/>- Finn is my second favorite in the Force Awakens. For the first time they gave Stormtrooper a meaning. In this film... Every scene Finn with Rose has is bad.<br/><br/>- Leia flying in space... Is the worst scene of Star Wars history. There is not even a word to say.<br/><br/>- Snoke. I have no problem with Snoke's death. Cause, he was cheap copy of the Emperor. They didn't even write a backstory. But, they ruined that Red Room fight. The set and cinematography of this scene was awesome. But again, that writing are bad.<br/><br/>- Rey's Jedi Fight training is only 1. She knows only a few fighting moves. She used the Lightsaber only twice. First of all against Kylo in the Force Awakens. Then against Luke in The Last Jedi. And after all, she can easily beat The Elite Praetorian Guard's of the Snoke. That was one of the most worst and absurd Star Wars fights.<br/><br/>- Daisy Ridley is absolutely fit for Rey role, no doubt. I don't care about Rey's family, does not have to be special or a chosen thing. But I do not accept such a cheap characterization. This character does not have to know everything about Force so easily. This was one of JJ.Abrams's mistakes and I thought it would be fixed in the second movie. And... They more ruined.<br/><br/>- And the biggest thing that mads me, what throws the film in the big hole. They absolutely ruined Luke Skywalker. I will never accept that. He didn't even have his own solo lightsaber fight scene. They've ruined his role with force projection thing. They wrote a absolutely bad scenario that never fits his characterization. Even Mark Hamill suffered while reading. And the scene where he died. Saddest thing ever for a legendary character.<br/><br/>All this and more is making this movie a worst Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7874636"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The whole story is just cheaply written. It uses the name of "Star Wars", the old classic sci-fi movie, and totally ruins the name of the classic. Starting from the beginning: 1) Luke refuses the train Rey, saying that the Jedi are arrogant and they must go extinct since they are the reason the Empire exists (there is a balance in the world: love creates hate, good creates bad etc.). Which is a rational response for me. Moments later he sees some archive footage from the 80s movie and accepts the train her. Good decision!<br/><br/>2) In the training Luke says that the Force is not some kind of power for Jedi to play with peoples minds and throw rocks. Instead, the force is the energy that keeps the balance of the world and connects everything. In the end of the movie the force is used to throw rocks.<br/><br/>3) The movie is mainly about the chase between the Rebel fleet and the Empire. The Rebels try to reach the planet Crait which consists an old Rebel base and send a distress signal from there. When they reach the planet, their plan is to send the Cruiser as a decoy and go to the planet with small escape ships. However, when the Captain asks "what is the plan?", they don't tell him for absolutely no logical reason. Because, they didn't tell anything to the captain for no reason, the captain thinks the commander has no plan and waits to die. So, he attempts to take over the ship in the last minute. The rebels fight with each other for no logical rational sensible reason.<br/><br/>4) While the Rebels are escaping to the planet, the Hacker guy tells the Empire that they are escaping and the Cruiser is a decoy. There is a major plot hole here since the Hacker guy had absolutely no chance of knowing the Rebels' plan. From the Rebels he only talked with Finn and Rose. Finn and Rose came to his planet because they were not avare of the Commander's genius plan.<br/><br/>5) After this major plot hole the Empire starts shooting the escape ships. THIS WAS THE PART WHERE I TOTALLY LOST IT! The Commander with the empty fueled Cruiser, calmly turns to the Snoke's giant-ass ship and does the most dumbest, unrealistic, cheaply-written thing ever in the Star Wars history. She light-speeds through the enemy ship. Yeah, she literally goes through the giant enemy ship with light speed. And voila! The giant, terrifying enemy ship is destroyed. No guns, ammo, even no fuel was used. Why use such stuff like lasers or bombs when you can light-speed through your enemies.<br/><br/>6) Anyway, while these are happening Rey is captured by Kylo Ren and Snoke because she telephatically connected with Kylo Ren and believed that Kylo could come to the Light Side. However, later we learn that Kylo Ren similarly thought that Rey could come to the Dark Side. However, before that we learn that neither of them used Force or such power since it was Snoke who connected them via Bluetooth from the beginning. But, this information becomes unimportant since he was just cut into half by Kylo Ren. He is an evil Mastermind who caught the Last Jedi but he let Kylo Ren to kill Rey and never thought Kylo could just betray him and kill him with the light saber right next to him. So he wasn't such a bad guy after all. Who was he anyway?<br/><br/>The other half of the movie also has it's moments but these are the things I write for now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The story is needlessly branched and unfocused and the script leaves the leading actors with very little to work with character-wise.<br/>The tone is all over the place due to excessive attempts to shoehorn "Guardians of the Galaxy" style humor in every scene. The film is visually stunning though and a few performances are emotional and genuinely funny. Last Jedi is an apparent departure from the Star Wars that we all knew and IMO it's going to pretty yet shallow and boring places.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I had built this idea in my head that The Last Jedi would be so amazing, that I almost didn't realize I hadn't seen the movie yet. Well, upon exiting the theatre, I felt crushed. Star Wars has been a part of my life for so long that I honestly feel that saying I DIDN'T like it was almost like saying I no longer love my children. I felt conflicted. It was, for lack of a better description, a mess. Non-sensical, silly where it needed to be serious, and basically everything that was once sacred was tossed to the street. The actors are amazing. The visuals are stunning. But the plot... well, what plot?<br/>I don't want to provide spoilers, so I'll summarize by saying that instead of writing a review, I feel like I'm writing a eulogy. Star Wars had a brilliant life. I believe that this was a final, gasping breath by a franchise that has lost the force. RIP.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If you're a true star wars fan and adhere to previously established Lucas canon, you will feel insulted by this nonsense. This was a SJW's wet dream. Nothing says "new generation" like focusing mainly on diversity of characters rather than the story. What they did to Luke has to be the worst thing done to a movie character in history. What they did to snoke was completely idiotic and such a missed opportunity. Now your main antagonist is an emo dark side user. Wow I'm scared. What this boils down to is Disney's new Star Wars universe is an appeal to the lowest common denominator. Lucas canon is thrown out the window, and these new movies make the entire existence of the OT and the Rebellion completely pointless/irrelevant. These will movies will make a fortune as usual because Disney is a cash cow, but Disney is apparently incapable of making good movies. They won't even consult Lucas on anything anymore to attempt to make a quality Star Wars movie. To reiterate, this was an appeal to the lowest common denominator SJW, plain and simple.

Disney realised that 'never change a winning formula' wasn't in place anymore. They needed new values and leave the predictable (and almost milked) concepts behind. The simplicity of good versus evil makes place for something more nuanced. A lot of people will hate this movie. I can only applause it.<br/><br/>By the time the movie ended, it had brought pure catharsis.

This is a decent sci-fi flick...if it had nothing to do with Star Wars and instead opted to run its own franchise into the ground.<br/><br/>"Your Snoke theory is wrong"<br/>Yup, it was really Rian Johnson all along (take out Snoke's scarring and they even look alike). Somehow worming his way into the Disney roundtable, he convinced a bunch of suits that throwing out a competent script and replacing it with his Looper style (boring character arcs and a wandering plot with no true purpose) would be the best thing to do. Well, this could've been directed by Uwe Boll and it would still pay off in sales and reviews, because Star Wars makes money no matter what (too big to fail) and reviewers always praise it no matter what. Things that The Mummy or Valerian got trashed for, is celebrated here.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's why it didn't work for me:<br/>Plotting, character progression, continuity.<br/>--The plot is a mess, leaning heavily on what I'm sure was the main plot of a Clone Wars episode (out of fuel and running from a tech-advanced enemy), except in that episode the characters are smart enough to think their gameplan through til the end....unlike the characters in this movie.<br/><br/>--The characters betray themselves, not only in-between movies but even in-between scenes. They only set-up the scene that their currently in, rather than feeling like living characters across the span of 2 (or 6) movies.<br/><br/>--Continuity was completely dropped. Which is fine if this were a spin-off, but it isn't. I love the concept of "kill the past" especially considering the universe these people live in....but that concept shouldn't take place in the middle of a trilogy.<br/><br/>So I find myself much less interested in the continuing story of SW, and more interested in seeing how Abrams will try to pick up the mess. For the folks harping that at least it isn't a re-tread like TFA: Crait is Hoth, Canto Bight is Jabba's Palace, Phasma is Boba, Super Saiyan Leia is Frozen Han.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke Skywalker, the one who kept his cool and was not turned to the dark side by the emperor, throwing his lightsaber away to demonstrate his allegiance to the light, the one who never lost faith in his belief that there is still good in his father, Darth Vader, would actually contemplate murdering a young man, much less his nephew, in his sleep, simply because he sensed the conflict in him.<br/><br/>The film meticulously seeks to deconstruct the very basis on which the star wars mythos has been grounded upon; and replace it with a version of Leia which can gracefully glide through space Mary Poppins-style, boring chase sequences of Finn and Rose riding space horses to avoid capture (imagine something taken out of Jurassic World or Jumanji) and an exhausting emotional ping pong between seriousness and silliness. Not to mention the endless ludicrous use of bad, outdated (seriously, "can you hear me?"), adolescent humor even in scenes where even inexperienced directors would know better than to mix in humor. And no, the humor does not even come close to that in the marvel movies. It is rather on par with the tasteless humor one "enjoys" in the Transformers movies. And have I mentioned how horrible Yoda is being rendered on the screen? Gareth Edwards did an amazing job on Rogue One and JJ Abrams successfully managed to set the tone for the new main trilogy, striking a balance between respecting the existing mythos and introducing new characters, even if he did so somewhat conservatively. Rian Johnson tosses everything out the window and delivers a technically sound but otherwise tasteless, soulless monstrosity perfectly aligned with the goals set by the film execs.<br/><br/>I have a bad feeling about this...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's totally clear now - Disney will destroy the franchise with its leftist SJW agenda.<br/><br/>My view on the characters:<br/><br/>Snoke the Joke: Nuff said<br/>Poe: Oh oh... toxic masculinity, micro aggression, mansplaining!<br/>Kylo: Still a whiny emo brat<br/>Leia: Dies and then Marry Poppins her way back to the ship? Seems legit.<br/>Rey: meh<br/>Luke: Jerking off a sea cow. So sad.<br/>Chewie: Turns vegan<br/>Token Asian Girl: check!<br/>Finn: Was he in this movie? He certainly didn't do anything.<br/>R2D2 / C3P0: useless<br/>Chrome Brienne of Tarth: useless<br/><br/>Plot / story:<br/><br/>Casino scene:<br/>This is where the movie killed me. I completely zoned out during this scene. What-the-hell-am-I-watching?<br/><br/>Rich white people are bad because they beat their kids, are cruel to animals and make money on arms dealing.<br/>**** you, Disney.<br/><br/>Kamikaze hyperjump:<br/>Cool idea. Should have been done by Admiral Ackbar, not Purple Hair Lady no one cares about.<br/><br/>Battle on Not-Hoth planet:<br/>I was getting excited seeing the setup, I thought this battle was going to resemble the famous Hoth battle. A rebel soldier in the trenches takes a lick of the white substance covering the ground.<br/>"Salt". Wut. A lackluster battle followed.<br/><br/>Even if I leave out Disney's SJW bs I'm still left with a very weak movie.<br/>Plot holes, cringe scenes, flat characters, dull story writing, badly placed "humor".<br/><br/>Dear Disney, please choke on your leftist SJW non-binary PC vegan soy lattes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It has is awesome moments along with flat ones too, I left the room feeling the movie had many loopholes that some of us noticed and some were oblivious about it. Last Jedi is certainly a polarized movie at different levels, I am bit surprised that critics gave such an excellent rate, perhaps they don’t like to criticize or diminish the quality of Disney’s work  by some mysterious reasons. I feel that if you want a heroine to be the star of this movie perhaps Disney can consider a female director that would be more in tune with Rey’s character like Patty Jenkis did for Wonder Woman.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It’s clear Disney is rushing these new movies out and it shows. Lucas for all his flaws at least planned his trilogies out. For the Disney Star Wars movies it feels like they are being made up on the fly. As if these talented directors are just passing a hot potato to the next guy just trying to make the best movie they can. Two years is not enough to time to make movies of this scale, especially when they need to write the source material simultaneously...When you look past the gorgeous technical achievements  of the film, all that left is a problematic cop out. There is nothing mind blowing about this movie. It’s a rehash of ESB and ROJ with a few good under developed ideas that could have had a lasting impact if they took their time to flesh it out...I guess a positive is that they are out of movies to rehash. Between Episode 7 and 8 they already covered ANH, ESB and ROJ. I get why though. When you are rushed you play it safe. However, maybe now they can truly make their own thing in episode 9. Although, the fact they had to rewrite the movie after firing Trevarow , and aren’t delaying the release tells me share holders are the number one priority here, as opposed to putting quality first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I definitely agree with the 86/100 metascore, i think it's the second best episode after A New Hope, who's a masterpiece. I was a little bit frustrated at the end of the last jedi for several points : Lack of lightsaber duel, too much space battleship and lack of jedi mythology exploration for a movie who's called ''the last jedi'' but this are this only bad points. Several Luke and Leia moments are just marvellous, the Rey-Kylo relationship is one of the strengths of the movie. I will not insult the New Trilogy Haters but go watch ''The Phantom Menace'' if you want, i prefer to watch The Last Jedi.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Unfortunately because it's a Star Wars movie, it's poor.  Rian Johnson took aim, fired, and completely missed the target.  Characters were poor, the humour made me cringe, and there was far to much of it. The plot was a mess and some story lines in fact turned out to be completely unnecessary, which leads me to believe they were there because Johnson had no solid ideas what to do with some of the characters. Snoke and Phasma, two characters with great possibilities became completely irrelevant. Some of the action set pieces were great, but the final scenes were so poorly done.  On the planet Crait it was a case of a line of Empire war machines face a line of antique rebel speeders.  There was no imagination there at all.  Overall the movie was seriously underwhelming.  This will go down as one of the worst movies along with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.  People are hyping it now, but in the cold light of day, when people actually reflect on the details, they'll realise it was a horrible mess of a movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Second, i'm not going to follow mindless wave of people, who give away 0-2 raitings. And third, this movie disappointed me. I don't expect people find my review "helpful" since i haven't left 0 raiting. I left 6 because i enjoyed picture and action. I saw good acting from Mark Hammil and Adam Driver (I'm not kidding, i like Kylo Ren in this movie). Sadly, these are the only good traits about this movie.  If touching bad side of movie, then we're about to go deep:<br/>1) Wasted characters. My greatest trouble with this movie and source of my complete disappointement. What was the point of foreshadowing Rey's parents identety, to throw it away? I cannot dig this stuff. Same goes for Snoke. Who was he? How he obtained such power (He was doing some creppy stuff in movie and it looked good)? Did he know Emperor and what happened to him? You'll never find this out in this movie... Because he's killed in last third of the film. Cpt. Phasma... well.. she's in this movie. Not going to talk about, how sad i was when i saw what you did with Luke.<br/>2) Pointless subplot with Finn and Rose. What was the point of it? Watch naruto and one piece a lot? "Great idea, let's throw this filler, to make our picture longer". No! This plot serves to show anything except pull us away from interesting stuff with Rey, Ben and Luke<br/>3) 5-th and 6-th reimagining (Sorry, if spelled wrong). Movie rips out scenes from episodes i mentioned above and throws them in movie, to... make it hard to watch, really. The pace is crazy. First it boring, then it's fun. Next it's long, then it's interesting. After it goes good climactic scene and more slow paced action. Long say short. It's a mess It's hard to describe my point in eng, i hope you understood<br/>4) Don't you think Rey's rock lifting scene would be better if we saw at least hint of her training in force using? She uses the force to lift huge pile of rocks, because scenario needs it. That's a bad way to go with characters. (May i recieve huge amount of dislikes, but i like this character. I just don't agree that she has to be too overpowered. I'd love her more if you gave us something so we can cheer for her)<br/>5) Some complete **** in this movie. I know we talking about fairytale where sounds could be heared in space and force can do anything, you only have to try. But... excuse me, if i find some scenes like speedlight charge, causing destruction of third part of **** and Leia flying in space aka superman, ridiculous. And... force ghosts always could use force to affect real world?<br/>6) Music. It sounds great, don't get me wrong... but there's nothing new added to new film. And even if added, it's completely forgetable. (For the record, i like March of the Resistance and Theme of Rey)<br/><br/>Thouse are bad stuff in this movie. Action was good, picture great, story... meh. And i wouldn't say anything if this was from marvel, but it isn't! I like how director wanted to show new abilities force can do, though some of their realisation were questionable. I won't be pointing it out, cause i'm tired typing. I don't expect a lot of people find my article helpful. I hope i find thouse who agree with me, even if their number not huge. I'm going to pray for good future for star wars universe, but for now i pick neutral side. I won't compare this movie to trash, but i ain't defending it either</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Is it possible so many of them are paid bots? Otherwise how could they rate a movie full of MacGuffins, gaping plot holes and logical inconsequences rated as high?<br/><br/>Hundreds of user reviews already stated what's wrong with this move in regards of storytelling, screenwriting art and simple logic. It has absolutely nothing to do with being "not Star Wars enough" or "taking bold decisions". So I am not going to repeat it here, stating simply it is just a bad movie.<br/><br/>I've seen one fan joking after seeing this: "Come back George Lucas, everything is forgiven!", and if before seeing "Last Jedi" I would swear I will never say prequel trilogy was actually good, now I must admit - prequel trilogy has at least two movies better than Last Jedi, I know it is hard to believe! So either watch it and see it for yourself or just skip this Star Wars and possibly everything that comes after it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In my opinion, Hollywood has lost some of its...imagination in recent years. A 're-hash' of this, a copy of 'that', mentality. Not this movie, finally, a studio took a preconceived, and up until now, cookie cutter George Lucas episodic Star Wars franchise and turned it upside down, on its own head. Bravo, Disney! I, and many others commend You! Rian Johnson had the vision, tenacity, and resolve to take this Saga where it needed to go, into the uncomfortable tragedies, and the unknown futures of characters, new and old. His vision is a mix of black, white and the color of red blood sand (with salt) palette, of death and destruction. A Rebellion, still clinging to "Hope", pursued by the ultimate evil. Mr. Abrams I do not envy you, and the task at hand. For finding your vision, to the conflict in this trilogy. As I, and am sure many others, would like the Star Wars trilogies to continue. Good luck, and may the force be with you, always...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The galaxy of TLJ is barren and empty, and all actions by the main characters feel devoid of meaning without the movie really addressing the context of their actions. It's the same old set-up where the audience is forced to accept that 'those are the good guys' and 'those are the bad guys' and it's 'good vs evil'. Even The Force Unleashed on Wii had a better story arc than this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Like almost an hour and half of the movie was completely pointless and added nothing to the overall plot. Rose is one of the most unlikable characters since Jar-Jar binks. The Rey - Luke story was extremely underwhelming, lots of the reveals were extremely disappointing. A couple of good space battle scenes, some nice lightsaber sequences and two or three good performances are what i liked about about the movie.

What's worse for series fans, it doesn't seem to take the lore seriously and has zero pay off for the set up mysteries from The Force Awakens (With JJ mysteries are we really surprised?). It's a shame as after my disappointing experience with the Force Awakens, I was ready for this movie to right the ship, but it seems Disney is just straying this franchise further off course. I have a bad feeling about this...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Отличный сюжет, да в середине провисает, но в конце разгоняется.<br/>Неожиданный поворыты, просто взорвали мне мозг, это надо видеть! И порги очень милые) Очень крутое кино!

I laughed about three times during the movie. I even got all misty-eyed when Rose's sister managed to drop the bombs onto the Dreadnaught with grim determination... then my wife wondered, "they're in space without gravity, how can they *drop* bombs?" She's not big on physics so I suggested that maybe the Dreadnaught was big enough to provide sufficient gravity, but this anecdote is symptomatic of my problems with the movie. It does have some beautiful set pieces, some striking visuals, it just doesn't really have a story to tell and the narrative strings which exist are full of holes. Like when Holdo actually manages to destroy or cripple the entire fleet chasing them. Sure, it was a lovely scene, breathtaking even. And when it's over you think, 'Wait, they can do that? Why wasn't this part of their original plan? Why didn't they do that with the other three ships they gave up. If they were going to be destroyed anyway, their pilots dying pointlessly, they could have done so. Or they could have used the transport Finn and Rose used to embark on their adventure.' And that was just the most glaring problem I saw without even having to think about it.<br/><br/>Characters don't develop or have arcs, they just twist in the wind, the exceptions being Kylo Ren and Rey who pretty much resist any form of development. Ren is a crappy Sith and Rey is a crappy Jedi, but that bit at least I trust is in there so they can finally meet in the middle and get rid of these harebrained pseudo-philosophies cooked up by Lucas. Luke has an arc of sorts but it's woefully unsatisfying, his one moment of realization marred by the fact that he gets helped out by Yoda again rather than achieving said realization under his own power.<br/><br/>The entire side-plot with Finn and Rose adds nothing to the story at the end of the day other than giving Finn something to do and adding in a character to encourage Chinese investors. Also, Rose is essentially a janitor on the cruiser, right? She says she spends all day behind vents or pipes or something. Where does she get off piloting an attack craft? I'm not even saying she shouldn't, but just like the possible gravity of the Dreadnaught, the movie might have done well acknowledging that this isn't just done for effect or to placate a certain audience but that there is an internal logic at play here. They could have cut things like cows stampeding through a casino to make room for things that actually make the plot seem less threadbare. But look! We have a dozen new cute CGI aliens in this movie!<br/><br/>The Force Awakens didn't grip me but it was a solidly-made movie with a developing plot. Rogue One was actually excellent, doing a lot of things right. So I did try to be optimistic about this one, but there was just no story here. This felt like a random episode of a Sci-Fi TV show, right down to the technobabble.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I have always liked Star Wars movies, even the episodes 1-3 even though I recognize that they are not very good. Episode 7 was a disappointment but at least it had it moments. This, on the other hand, was terrible. Honestly if I wasn't sitting in the middle of the row in the theater I would have left after half way though the movie. The movie is full of totally unbelievable stuff, half of the scenes try to be artistic when rest feel glued on. The story is plain stupid, dialog is terrible and especially humor is so forced it was physically painful to watch. There was no meaningful character development excluding one that was in any way interesting or plausible. The threat of the Imperium/First Oder is totally non existent when they are totally incompetent and depicted as complete morons. I don't care if you have a scifi or fantasy movie but if you have established some rules in that universe you cannot just ignore them in every scene. I also hate that is seems that the heroes can go anywhere they want at any time.<br/><br/>I don't want to even start with the actor performance but still I must say that only good performance was from Mark Hamill. For all the rest I was just hopping that the characters would be killed off at some point. I didn't feel any attachment to any of the characters in any level. And whats up with all the cute animals everywhere that have nothing to do with anything?<br/><br/>-Beyond disappointed Star Wars fan</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Who wrote this sacrilege? This movie was made for the mainstream and not Star Wars Fans. An entire generation of the Best fans in the world ignored and insulted. Total disrespect for for the Great George Lucas and his vision. Totally forgotten and misused are the originals and prequels, which are now some kind of legend. I am completely saddened at the direction the once Great franchise has taken. Obviously these critics have no knowledge or idea of what Star Wars is or was. Long live the Jedi and Sith.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

However I might admit that the first 1/3 (not including the first space battle scene) is extremely disappointing with some reveals that have extremely poor execution. Soon after the battle, some characters get sent on a mission which I’m pretty sure contained a countless amount of MacGuffins and some lacklustre world-building which is unlike anything Star Wars would ever do (even the Porgs got annoying after a few jokes)<br/><br/>As I was watching these scenes on Canto Bight, I honestly thought they’ve messed this up so badly that it’s unsaveable. However, the last 1/3 is some of the most outstanding scenes that this franchise has to offer. The battle scenes are fantastic and tension is high throughout. The island scenes with Luke and Rey are also a highlight with some fantastic creature-effects as is to be expected with the franchise. I could make the point that this stuff was so good that I was disappointed by everything else but it all has to be at the same level and it wasn’t. I think I’m nervous yet excited for Episode IX, it has the potential to be terrible or fantastic</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

So many plot holes, **** ups with character story and direction. It's like the people who made this movie have no idea what Star wars is, or the history behind the characters they're playing with. Throw in the **** and stupid humour that didn't work in most, not all, as well as a subplot that is based on a plot hole and wastes 30min of the movie and you got a **** ass 2.5 hour waste of your evening.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke Skywalker spent the past 40 years as THE fantasy sci-fi super hero, but will now be forever remembered as a washed-up, pathetic, and damaged hermit. JJ Abrams set up so many intetesting story arcs in the previous film, then the current director decided to go absolutely nowhere with any of it. Apologists claim this is "bold risk taking." I remember when I was 15 and thought it was bold to be flaunt my propensity for risk taking.

I previously abhorred "The Force Awakens", and I still do.<br/><br/>I was absolutely surprised to the contrary. This is possibly my favorite SW film to date, possibly even better than Rogue One. The characters from TFA really come into their own in this film, with amazing performances that also explore their deep-seated psychological issues (Kylo Ren & Rey). This is a visually and aurally mind-blowing film. The space and ground battles are astonishing, let alone due to the originality of the planets they are fought in, and the look of the ships aswell as the sounds. This is a film that in scale, leapfrogs what we saw in TFA and even Rogue One.<br/><br/>On the negatives, the film has a pacing issue. The entire film is basically one massive extended sequence, and drags on. My other gripe is the character of "Rose", which I found unlikeable and totally useless in the film.<br/><br/>Finally, onto the story itself. I believe this is what ultimately causes the bad ratings. It is obviously a very divisive story. It is quite clear in this film that the makers of TFA had no idea where they wanted to take the story. Most of the deep plot questions everyone had were resolved more (Kylo Ren, Rey, Luke) or less (Snoke, Phasma) satisfyingly. What I will say as a SW fan is that the film is an amazing mixture of pure nostalgia and fan-service, but also truly taking SW into the new age. I always felt the prequel series suffered from childish use of CGI and bland acting...TLJ is a hard-hitting visceral SW film. I've read some reviewers complain that the SW lore is spat upon. I disagree. I feel Rian Johnson obviously TOOK RISKS but also took SW into the new age whilst giving the hardcore fans (like me) some real fan-service.<br/><br/>This for me is an 8/10. Surpasses all the prequel films. I prefer not to compare to the OT because I feel they are in a category of their own. On par and even better than Rogue One. Misses a perfect mark (10/10) due to the bad pacing issue and the annoying Rose character.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see what JJ Abrams does with episode 9. But I am very negative considering TFA is such a useless film in the series. If anything, TLJ is what TFA should have been. TFA is an extended introduction to the characters, which was not thought out and just made to make money, TLJ really kicks things into gear and makes things happen to the characters.<br/><br/>Well done Rian Johnson.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Instead of twisting/subverting the established Star Wars formula, the film winds up being very much "business as usual."  Hopes dashed for the trilogy and Episode IX.  On a related note: Something extremely strange has happened with the professional critics' reviews.  Are they simply out of touch with the moviegoing public?  Afraid they will lose their jobs if they give a Star Wars film a bad review?  Or bought and paid for by the powers-that-be?  It's troubling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Attack of the Clones is better than the garbage that this film is. This film seems to be designed to clear the Star Wars franchise of any remnants of the old storylines or mythology that Lucas built. It seems that Disney and Rian Johnson only want to keep light sabers, untrained force users, and small scale imperial and rebel forces for future films. Far from feeling like a continuation of the Star Wars saga this film seems to be some kind of transition story to set up the rules for the future Star Wars films. As a fan of the original trilogy growing up and a fan of most of the prequel trilogy as an adult I left the theater feeling something that I have never felt after seeing a Star Wars movie. I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The Force is not with this film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

How luke projected himself across the galaxy and made a saber fight!!!! why did he killed himself? No point. he projected himself and also dice!! Unreal. SW is not like soap opera movies like marvel movies. people watch marvel movies and forget. SW is not like that, you remember it decades later. you can not put stupid jokes in it. worst jokes i've ever seen in a movie. whyyyy!!!! Also i want to say another stupid plot hole. almost in every episode good guys want to explode things like death stars etc. I didn't understand why didn't they just drive a ship to this things and crash through.. We see in this movie it is very easy to explode a huge ship just jump to light speed through it. stupidddd!!!!! i dont want to explain SW mentality but where is the shields!!!! is it that much easy to kill a super super super star destroyer?
