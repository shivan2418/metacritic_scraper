I could not disagree more. As a person who had nothing against the Force Awakens' oft-maligned themes of diversity, I found Rian Johnson's addition to the Star Wars universe a convoluted mess. Outside the story-line revolving around Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren, the movie was incredibly underwhelming, obviously plagued by disjointed and uneven writing. There are some strong moments in The Last Jedi, but overall, the movie is a very sloppy sequel as well as a fairly mediocre standalone movie. Claiming that you are going "postmodern" on the franchise is hardly an excuse for average execution, and no grandstanding by critics from their ivory towers will change the fact that Johnson's movie is one of the weaker additions to the Star Wars franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

(SPOILERS) From Luke and his character, to the Casino Scene, to the Alien Cows it was all terrible there were some good scenes but most was very much stupid. Luke was used terribly he didn't get a huge light saber fight and he went through light saber training again and lost what 30 pounds for this role and all he got was a couple dodges? What about that stupid Rose x Finn? I mean Rose is a character we barley meet and it feels like this relationship is forced. What about Snoke then? He is a major character just like Captain Phasma yet there is no character development both of those characters had so much potential yet they die with only 10 - 20 minutes of screen time on both movies. This movie is just a disgrace to Star Wars and hopefully J.J. Abrams who is very talented is able to save this trilogy and honestly Star Wars all together.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A movie full of action sequences without any weight because there is no care put into adding any depth to the universe, making it feel pointless.  There was a wonderful opportunity to go into detail about what happened to the Jedi, backstory of Kylo Ren, Snoke, Luke, the religion of the Jedi, anything.  Yet the lazy approach was taken.  Luke fails miserably as a Jedi instructor and doesn't even study the Jedi Scriptures to find out his error?  Come on.

Now I must say that I'm not someone who is familiar with the full lore of Star Wars (I've only seen the 9 movies multiple times). I especially liked the visuals and some of the more poetic moments (Leia's flight but also the silence after the push to light-speed by Holdo), and the Luke part was all quite great as were the action sequences. As many others, I disliked the casino scenes and even in general, the new characters do not bring any value (Rose is irritating as is DJ's stuttering). I don't really understand the ongoing discussion about Snoke. Some people seem to think that Rian didn't like the character and so he killed him off. This is of course complete bs, do you really think Disney doesn't have a clear 3-movie arc for Snoke...? It has become quite impossible to make a Star Wars movie which pleases all due to the contradictive expectations. Looking forward to IX and the following trilogy (and the Han Solo spin off).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

So many lines said by characters made no sense...a disconnected senseless movie. I have never watched a movie and thought, what are they doing, why did they say that? And if the director could please tell me how bombs fall in the near vacuum of space? They really need to teach more science in schools. How about no bombs at all. I thought Star Wars was about laser beams and light sabers. I could go on, but why bother, let's just join the critics, clap our hands, and drool at all the fancy cinematography. Note, I am an old Star Wars fan, but have no desire to watch any more new movies. Excuse me, I need to leave and attempt to empty my memory of this ridiculous movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Disney is continuing the destruction of the franchise that Lucas started with the prequels.  So much of the film is awkward, nonsense and a waste of time, from both a storytelling perspective and as a viewer.<br/>I won't go into details, but the movie awful to the point that I no longer care for Star Wars.  I'm tired of paying money for disappointment.  The writing is main the culprit.  It is just awful.<br/>No one that has any influence on the film seems to care about quality.  They are merely making a special effects presentation with Star Wars branding and expect audiences to freely throw their money and praise at it, regardless of content.<br/>The theatrical versions of the of the original three films are what made Star Wars great.  Unfortunately, it appears that it never get any better than the rubbish currently on display, due in large part to cult fanboy fanaticism that defends poor stewardship of the universe by Disney, simply because it carries the Star Wars name.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The good is the back and forth between ben and rey is great, Mark Hamill does a great job acting. Also the twist of not knowing what is going to happen is nice. The bad is that there are so many plot holes and inconsistency that it kinda makes it hard to like the movie. You leave the movie theather not feeling great, because there was no real point or indication on what will happen in the next movie. It is also like X-men 3 where they kill off a whole bunch of characters, so rather than to build upon the movie seems like it try to breakdown everything worked in the previous movie. Also the plot holes mess with your brain so it hard to believe that the concurrent scene is plausible. You also kinda start hating the heros, because they makes things worse than better.<br/><br/>After thinking about it, this is not a film for people wanting hope or wanting logic. It based on a writer hubris, who believes it is his job to antagonize fans and take away what they like about star wars. I find that has what cause fans to be upset because in a way it betray their zealots over their idea of what star wars is. This further complicates things as Rian is only the writer of one star wars and abbrams it taking back the mantle. This is the mad scientist working on the ip without care for the effects. It is the Batman & Robin of Star Wars pretty much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke just decides to die; after thinking that the old jedi books were destroyed... when they weren’t even destroyed rey had them on the falcon. Yoda summons real lightning? Canon is disregarded and people do things they would never do. Engineer is suddenly a fighter pilot, rey with no training is just as good as kylo still.

Poca acción, ninguna línea memorable y Disney está únicamente usando el acreditado nombre de Star Wars para ganar dinero. No se respeta a la franquicia. Para los niños es una genial película pero para gente con criterio más desarrollado, definitivamente es una película POBRE. Se salva un tanto por los efectos especiales y por Mark Hamill.

Saying it is poorly written is somewhat of an understatement. Little in the story makes sense, and the sequel to The Force Awakens fails to pick up on many of the unanswered questions left open in the previous film. Events are clumsily forced, resorting to hand-waving at best and having competent characters acting jarringly stupid and out of character at worst.<br/><br/>Many of the scenes in the movie are rehashed versions of scenes from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, with the original participants in the scene substituted by the new cast. Usually there is a little twist making the scene slightly different than the original, but the movie becomes frustrating to watch as it rehashes scenes we’ve seen done better in previous films.<br/><br/>Not only that, but there are major things in both this and The Force Awakens that invalidate previous films and characters and makes you question what was the point of it all? Luke’s efforts to become a Jedi across three films seem wasted when Rey can exceed the power of one of the most powerful Force users in existence in about 20 minutes without having any training. The victory over the Empire means nothing when The First Order simply replaces them with their own playboy-dressing Emperor copy. Clones are no longer needed to have an infinite supply of Stormtroopers for yet again unexplained reasons. Even the victory over Starkiller base in The Force Awakens is disregarded as The First Order now apparently have conquered the entire galaxy, despite them being left vulnerable to retaliation for the atrocities committed in TFA.<br/><br/>While some parts feel a little too much like a video game, the movie’s special effects team and designers have generally done an outstanding job. And it would be unfair to not mention that there are a few very interesting and intense scenes that are not only epic, but also manage to capture the personality and relationship between key characters in the universe. In these moments it’s nice to see what is actually a great cast given an opportunity to show what they can do.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these moments are rare in a lazily copy-pasted minimum effort story that leaves you wondering why Disney couldn’t be bothered to get a decent writer or writing team on board for such a prestigious project, instead of simply assuming the masses aren’t intellectually capable of looking past the flash, and that the usual review outlets lack the courage or integrity to call a spade a spade.<br/><br/>But maybe the joke’s on us, because ticket sales are sky high and the critic scores are just about doubling the user scores across the web. For me personally, I have lost the appetite for watching the final chapter. But will people forgive the transgression or mindlessly shamble into the dark theater again next year? I fear they might.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Otherwise, this entire movie is a mess with too much misplaced humor, inconsistent pacing, and weird transitions. It's a shame because the movie had some bold ideas, but the execution was terrible that I'm surprised the studio actually went ahead with the final product. Worse of all, it adds absolutely nothing to the Star Wars lore and instead, negates almost everything the previous movie, "Force Awakens," set up. It serves no purpose and should never have been approved. There is no overall vision or direction and you cannot claim to be the middle act of a "sequel" trilogy without one. It's almost as if Disney and Rian Johnson wanted to make a "trolling" movie to stir up the fan base. I still have trouble believing anyone can think this mess of a movie is a "masterpiece." Objectively, this was not even a competent movie, let alone a Star Wars movie and I'm terribly disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Before I place my own thoughts into type, I would comment on what I have been reading of others. When I read comments by those who dislike the film, they write just that. They reveiw and comment on the film shown uupon the screen.<br/>Those who like the film? They talk about everything else and every other movie of the franchise instead of the flim which had been upon the screen.<br/>The "Last Jedi" is, in effect, Darth Nihilus as if such a character could be a movie (Or anything, really given the nature of what Darth Nihilus is)<br/>The 'Last Jedi' is such a complete 'Anti' film that critics can seemigly do nothing BUT compare it to EVERYthing else in Star Wars because... there simply is NO movie (Effectivly) on the screen too review. This film truly has nothing to offer in and of itself that one could class as a 'Movie'. It has no plot. At least, nothing over arching that could be considered as a plot.<br/>It has no real dialouge. Characters seeminly 'One liner' words at each other in sentences form, meaning passes... but nothing is actually meaningfully or coherantly discussed between characters.<br/>The characters? They effectivly do nothing. They effectivly acheive nothing.<br/>At the beginning of the film the Resistance is fleeing from the First Order. At the end of the Film the Resistance is fleeing from the First Order.<br/>At the beginning of the film Kylo Ren is a force of darkness. At the end of the film Kylo Ren is a force of darkness.<br/>Characters that are introduced during this movie... are no longer there when the movie ends.<br/>And so the list of 'Anti' film goes on.<br/>The makers of the last three films have succeeded in acheiveing something within myself that I truly never thought I would see. That I no longer care what happens to or with the franchise. A better title for the film would have been simply;<br/>"Star Wars, meh."</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I hope after all the greedy and political mofo milk this franchise to the bone and die, true star wars fans can take over and replace this garbage with the original canon.  Jaina Solo and Mara Jade are vastly superior female protagonist than the random op girl (forgot the name... that's how bad the character is. lol) that poor Daisy Ridley is stuck with.  Force Awaken was at least trying to create its own mythos...  this one completely trashes everything including Force Awaken's story while adding nothing.  Boycotting the last movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As the film progresses, it becomes a roller-coaster ride of nostalgia and new ideas broiling into so layers that it almost becomes three movies in one. Controversially, I understand why the critics loved it and the fans are on edge about the new steps taken with this film. The trilogy rules are broken in this film with us fans going 'What can even happen in the third film'; and this is why I love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It really helped in flesh out both characters, especially Kylo (he is still a emotionally unstable crybaby turned killer).<br/><br/>*Luke conversation with Yoda was really a nice thing. Interesting enough was the fact that Yoda was able to interact with the world either by making a lighting strike the tree or by hiting Luke in the head with his cane.<br/><br/>*The duel between Kylo and Rey against Snoke guards was really good. Amazing coreography.<br/><br/>*Luke's display of Force mastery by the end.<br/><br/>*The little kid using the Force to pull a broom at the end.<br/><br/>DISLIKES<br/><br/>*The MAIN PLOT of the movie is pretty much ridiculous: it is a stupid chase at subluminal speed because the Republic flagship can't hit hiperspace more than once for lack of fuel and because the First Order ships found a way to tail them in FLT flight. However WHY not even one of the several First Order ship's captains had the simple idea of making a short hiperspace jump to the position where the fleet trying to slowly  run away was?????<br/><br/>* Why didn't Vice Admiral Holdo share her plan to go to the Crait planet while using the Republic flagship as bait to allow escape ships to hid in the planet?<br/>Instead she acts like a huge @sshole demanding blind obedience. Sure chastize Poe for acting out of line but at least share with all the Officers and pilots giving their lives for the fight what your plan was. Had she done that  then perhaps half of said officers and fighters wouldn't have joined a motim against her.<br/><br/>*Luke's death by the end was really stupid, why not finish that scene with just him looking at the Sun? Really unnecessary death, feels like the director was just trying to make some CHEAP shock value.<br/><br/>*Snoke is a joke. All powerfull but can't realize Kylo is actually going to kill him instead of Rey? That feel like a really "screw you" directed at JJ Abrams by Riam.<br/><br/>*Really bad explanation to all the foreshadowing Abrams did in SW TFA about Rey's parents. Again another "screw you" moment from Riam to JJ Abrams.<br/><br/><br/>All in all STAR WARS THE LAST JEDI is a movie that has it's really good moments amid a lot of fat in the story and bad resolutions to mysteries from the previous movie.<br/><br/><br/>A good movie but it could have been a LOT BETTER.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Easily one of the most Controversial flicks of the year.<br/><br/>I thought it was actually genius, the fact that it has managed to divide a community, split fans, and has become hauled as one of the worst star wars flicks is impressive, this film has stuck with me, personally, and is definitely one of the most philosophically rich and intriguing flicks in this franchise, and one of the most interesting flicks of the year due to reaction and the debate that it has raised. The script was strangely bold, and managed to break expectations, the actual character dynamics and developments of these characters are strange, completely unexpected, but honestly, greatly needed, in my opinion. I was quite taken back by the decisions that they went in.  It's not necessarily the fact that it makes HUGE jumps thematically from the original franchise or the previous film, its still Star Wars, it still respects the old and plays to fan service...like every film in the franchise... It's more so the fact that it allows itself to take the past, take pre-assumed assumptions of how these characters should be, after all they have been through, and presents this strangely intriguing film about failure, and not being able to live up to expectations, or live up to the past, to slowly over time become overwhelmed by expectations and become disillusioned due to time, and to lose sight of what you originally set out to achieve. Failure is at the heart of the script, at the heart of these characters, they are failures, in the grand scale of this new error, we aren't seeing the stereotypical Hero's journey, these lines are slowly being crossed. I definitely agree this film is way too long, i definitely agree that the humor is average and pretty bad. And I agree that one of the narrative arcs is definitely terribly weak, and that it has issues in terms of pacing. But when Im reading comments complaining about Laura Dern's character having purple hair, when Im reading comments complaining about this absurd belief that the film is being POLITICALLY CORRECT i cringe. I can't even see how, or why, this would be the case. Its gross tbh. I definitely agree with many of the valid criticisms towards this flick, and agree 100% if u didn't enjoy it. Your entitled to your beliefs. But idk, being someone that never really loved Star Wars, I found this strangely poetic and relevant in terms of power dynamics and how things have currently been within these times that we are now living in. I even think the divisive reactions from fans are even more so enhancing the core themes of the flick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Left open plot lines from The Force Awakens(TFA).  - TFA made Snokes background a major plotline, this move did not explain any of it.  - TFA made Rey's background a big deal, this movie provided an unsatisfactory resolution.  (What's the point of making them a mystery in TFA, if they're nobodies?)  - TFA setup Finn to be force sensitive, no further development here.  - TFA made out Snoke to be supremey powerful, he met an anticlimactic end in this movie.<br/>2.  Poor overall plot.  - Casino subplot was unecessary, when you think about it.  Why did the purple haired lady hide her plan?  If she had disclosed it the casino would have been unnecessary.  - The whole Casino scene was unnecessary, it ended up failing overall.  - Finn's romance with the asian girl was poorly written.  Her character was not developed, it felt forced.  TFA had some romantic tension with Rey and Finn, not furthered in this movie.  - How do bombs "fall" in gravity?  - This was a problem with TFA as well, but how the hell does Rey overcome Elite Guards without training?  3.  Betrayal of Luke Skywalker.  - Luke spent the first trilogy trying to redeem his father, you're telling me the same Luke, would kill his nephew after he sensed a little bit of darkness?  GTFOH!!!<br/>4.  Comedy was forced and cheesey and out of place.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

He erred just like all jedi, feared the dark side like all jedi, isolated himself just like all others, redeemed himself with strength, because he understood that the Force is not only in a reclusive group, and became a legend - A legend that endures in all the stories in several galaxies that make him the greatest hero in the galaxy, and the reason to catch the rebels shattered by the New Order, and instead of fleeing or being slaves like the boy, fight.

Last Jedi can be summed up in one scene at the very beginning of the movie: Luke tosses the lightsaber over his back. There was so much in this movie that was blatantly irreverent. I feel sorry for the director who has to try and pick up the pieces with episode 9 because, unlike episode 7, I really don't see what could happen next, nor do I really have a desire to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Instead of pushing characters into new and bold directions, it is just more of the same and some character-arcs seem to be copied and pasted from the last instalment. The Pacing and tone of the movie are all over the place, and hugely dramatic scenes with high stakes (or so the movie wants us to believe) are intercut with humorous bits of droid-shenanigans. Some of the characters start to behave erratically and the internal logic of the cinematic Star Wars universe is pushed to the sidelines in favor of cheap, but visually impressive crowd-pleasers. Yes, I'm talking about that one splitting scene that will cause every single person to ask "Why haven't they done that stuff in the old movies?".<br/><br/>With this being a second act of a trilogy, it plays much more like a third act and leaves little to nothing to do for the characters in the next film. The shadow of what this movie could have been looms heavy, and ultimately forces me to retitle it to "Episode VIII: The Wasted Potential".</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I am not a bot and I'm not affilated with any alt right groups. I have been a SW fan my entire life, as many of my fellow fans who were utterly disappointed with the movie. These are all people voicing their opinion, deal with it. Here is mine:<br/><br/>What I liked:<br/>-Mark Hamill and Adam Driver were amazing.<br/>-Many people found that scene ridiculous, but I personally liked Leia using the Force to pull herself back to the ship. It was already established that she was Force sensitive when she sensed Luke in Ep. 5.<br/>-The visuals and sounds were good.<br/>-Yoda's appearance.<br/>-When "TIE Fighter Attack" started playing I actually felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>What I disliked:<br/>-The movie opens with a lame "your mom" joke.<br/>-Poe Dameron sacrifices an entire squad of bombers without any regret because he is the embodiment of "toxic masculinity".<br/>-After Leia pulls herself back, Poe opens the door to open space, but the people don't get sucked out by the vacuum (Ep. 3 and TCW got this right).<br/>-Holdo doesn't tell her plan to Poe so he is forced into making a mistake, which is intended to make the audience think that he's dumb. Thing is, Holdo is at fault here for being a bad leader and not communicating with an established star pilot of the Resistance.<br/>-Casino planet was boring and it consisted about Disney (!) saying that capitalism is bad. Rich people=bad, poor people=good.<br/>-The movie structure is very similar to Empire Strikes Back, except the battle of Hoth takes place at the end of the movie.<br/>-The throne room events are very similar to the one in Return of the Jedi.<br/>-Rey, after a couple days of lightsaber training, is able to defeat several of the elite guards. She seems to be just as potent in combat as Kylo Ren, who had been trained as a Jedi/Knight of Ren his entire life. Luke Skywalker in the OT practiced for weeks to be a decent duelist and Force user, while in the Prequels Jedi trained their entire life from a very young age. What I'm saying is: Rey is undeniably a Mary Sue.<br/>-Captain Phasma, heralded by the media as "the first female villain of SW" (she isn't, Asajj Ventress exists), gets 3 minutes of screen time, getting beaten by Finn. She seems like a running gag from a cartoon at this point.<br/>-During the Battle of Crait, Rose stops Finn from saving the Resistance, and then drops the most cringeworthy line of the Star Wars franchise.<br/>-Finn and Rose crash land in front of the AT-M6 line, kilometers away from the Resistance base. A few minutes later we see Finn dragging an unconscious Rose back to the base on foot. The First Order showed them mercy and didn't shoot them on the way back, or maybe they missed because Finn was walking so fast.<br/>-I personally felt like Rian Johnson's biggest goal with this movie was to bamboozle fans with his pretentious plot twists. It felt a little forced to me because there were just too many.<br/>-My biggest issue: The reason I wanted to watch this film was to see what happened to Luke. I felt like his character was mistreated and underused by Rian Johnson just to make way for Rey. Luke in this movie was a grumpy, scared and reluctant old man who had very minimal impact on the story. I wanted to see him get some love, maybe a bit of fan service like the one scene we got with Vader at the end of RO. Instead he shows up at the end of the movie as a distraction, sacrificing himself for the Resistance. But it turns out it wasn't him, he was just showing us a new kickass force power, great! He doesn't need to die! Maybe JJ Abrams can give him some justice in Ep. 9... Aaaaand he dies from exhaustion... Are you serious? RJ did a 180 with his character and then killed him off because people would be more interested in Luke than in Mary Sue. Luke Skywalker had to actually learn how to use the Force and to fight with a lightsaber. We saw his journey from a whiny farm boy to a wise Jedi Knight. What journey did Rey have? Expert pilot, Force user (who can lift a hundred rocks without any proper training) and lightsaber duelist from the beginning. Not Mary Sue btw.<br/>-Then at the end of the film we see a child effortlessy using telekinesis to grab a broom. In the OT and prequels, characters needed training in the Force to be able to use these powers. Apparently in the sequels anybody who is Force sensitive can casually use telekinesis, mind tricks etc. This is another way Rian Johnson disregarded the previous lore.<br/><br/>This movie left me utterly uninterested in Episode 9, because I don't care about the new characters. They are boring, one-dimensional and didn't have a proper progression like Han or Luke.<br/>This movie felt like a mockery of Star Wars mixed with political messages. I personally don't like watching my favourite franchise being used as a tool to push an agenda. This, paired with the poor plot and utter disrespect for Lucas' Saga is worth 0p</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Lucasfilm's dark empress Kathleen Kennedy needs to get a message that she should give keys of SW to someone who truly loves it. Disney isn't wholly to blame because they let the Marvel movies and Pixar work independently under them with great results. But if anything they should have intervened with this garbage production. It could be called Star Wars: The Anticlimax. Every (action)scene is a disappointment, except maybe one throne room scene. I saw this with a free ticket and came here to warn people. Many have fortunately already said many things wrong with The Last Jedi. This movie continues Force Awakens's nullification of our classic heroes' character arcs, force feeding us one dimensional new ones (but they are so diverse!) and giving recycled story beats, only this time with really stupid twists. There is a way to handing the torch to new heroes while respecting old ones but this sequel trilogy has done about the worst possible job at it. Biggest disrespect is for Luke Skywalker. He should have been grown to be very powerful and the script should have risen to the challenge to give him worthy obstacles. They have all the scripting power of Hollywood to their disposal. But no, Rian and story group cop out the worst way. Oh and the galaxy feels empty in this, there's only Resistance with their deserted planets and the First Order, the rest of the galaxy is all on Canto Bight apparently.<br/><br/>It's easy to guess why Darth Kathleen Kennedy handed keys of the whole new trilogy to Rian Johnson: He's one of the two directors who is willing to work for her without objections about direction of these movies and he agreed to cover this movie with heavy handed childish SJW/feminazi- propaganda. In the movie all white men are bad or just suck and all the women are great in every way. I bet that galactic **** is cackling all the way through when watching this propaganda piece. One point for Hamill's great acting. Not seeing Ep. 9. I have no intrest anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Check<br/><br/>New Heroes in safety bubble while everyone around them dies? Check<br/><br/>Cute aliens to sell toys? Check<br/><br/>Hoth like battle on sand instead of snow? Check<br/><br/>Space chase like episode 5... well not as exciting but Check<br/><br/>Ok now explain bombs that fall in space. Leia surviving space long enough to force pull back to the cruiser. Dj learning about the shuttles. Rose being portrayed as a strong female character, yet throws the survival of the resistance away for a fangirl love of Finn. Phasma was a complete waste. I enjoyed three moments in the film if I am being honest and the person next to me fell asleep in the middle and started snoring.

It's with great sadness that I say that Last Jedi was a disappointment. It was overly long and bloated, wasting a good half hour on pointless scenes that the plot didn't need. Many scenes were literal recreations of pieces of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and the superfluous casino scene looked like a CGI prequel nightmare right out of Phantom Menace. But the most disappointing was how the story destroyed the long time character of iconic characters to make them unrecognizable and unlikeable. I agree with Mark Hamill's statement when he honestly said, "This was not Luke Skywalker. I had to pretend that I was playing a different person." So much of this movie destroyed what had come before for no discernable benefit. And audiences have responded. The movie has dropped like rock in its second week after the initial premiere rush, with awful Batman v Superman type box office numbers. When a Star Wars film is being compared to a DC movies bomb, you know they did something wrong. I can only hope that JJ Abrams fixes some of the damage this movie has done to the Star Wars brand in the next film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Generally speaking I am just fine with Star Wars as a whole. So well! I came to the movie and here is why I like it and classify it as a great, entertaining one:<br/>- it has a really good, not oboxious humour<br/>- acting (especially of younger members of the cast) is very good (and pay attention to the fact that creating a role in such a hyped movie is a really hard task even for experienced actors)<br/>- it lasts for about 2,5 hours and I wasn't bored all that time, they managed to keep me invested<br/>- it lasts for about 2,5 hours, they could've made a shorter movie and still did great at the box office<br/>- shots in this movie are great, many times very artistic and... static which is actually good in action movie because when action finally breaks in, it feels much more realistic and makes your heart go wild<br/>- it's quite unpredictable but also coherent, you don't feel like "well, that's nice but why they've done this or that, wouldn't it be easier this or that way?"<br/>- thay managed to make a new, nice planet (and it isn't sand or lava, or jungle)<br/>- CGI is very good and used only when needed<br/>- there isn't !@#$ ton of action and pew-pew-pew all the time<br/>- I find it a nice polemic with older Star Wars movies<br/>If it would be the first Star Wars movie I've ever seen this movie would make me feel that SW is a very nice thing to know and would encourage me to watch more. I understand that many people feel anger with it because "it is not the old saga!" and also because a super-corporation like Disney produces it but concidering the fact that there are many movies that try to make money out ONLY from your nostalgia and add nothing to they products (great and sad example is Hobbit - produced by the same company which produced LOTR and directed by the same guy who directed LOTR) but a lot of CGI and running, and action... Star Wars - The Last Jedi is very good example how to deal with such a task without turning it into a mindless pile of references people like.<br/>May the force be with you!

I'm not a movie buff, nor am I any sort of analyst that can critic a piece based on specific criteria. This entry into the series was really bad.. Really bad. If you have to see this movie, I would not pay money for this. I  do not regret my purchase, because I was extremely curious because of the huge gap between critic reviews and regular jane|joe reviews. In this particular case, there is most certainly some **** going on, like usual people want to keep their ability to get early copies/showings. First off, going into this do not view it as Star Wars and the Star Wars universe and from a galaxy far away, but a political propaganda piece about the U.S.. I'm not going to go on about which ever side is correct etc, but simply say that instead of viewing something interesting, they attempt to gorge you on political references throughout the entire movie which I assume, is to assuage one into believing that this is some deep, relevant movie(if it's indeed not trying to manipulate you into thinking a certain way.); in exchange for anything of potential interest. This is a propaganda movie, and I say that objectively with no preference or interest in either side. Every plot, every scene, every character is analogous to some ridiculous stereotype leaving the characters two-dimensional as hell, with ZERO character growth as if none of the incredulous, PTSD inducing events had any effect on these characters, like they literally went through the whole first movie and the second movie with blinders on. The characters are static and flat. The settings are absolute **** with barely any variance from the first to the second movie. There three settings. Some random small piece of land on some forgettable planet, space, and on a space ship. No variety, hardly any wow moments. The ONLY vista/scene that I was in awe of was where Luke faces down several AT walkers, in some triumphant one-person army kind of scene and the shot is so epic that it hypes you up to think "Skywalker is about to go ham on these space-nazis.". HOWEVER, that scene is undercut with garbage and fails absolutely, into which I will not go into detail because it is so rage inducing. This movie is bad. The most powerful character in Star Wars is reduced to a Force Fart after exerting his geriatric self too hard supposedly, the second most powerful/trained force user with powerful lineage who is reduced to a whiny brat again who did not learn anything from his balding, sequin body suit mutant leader is beaten by an untrained, so perfect she's not believable fantasy Nobody. That Nobody, Rey, doesn't grow, doesn't learn yet uses her feelings so often she might as well be the Dark Side already, and reduced to some bull**** too perfect fantasy character that no one can relate to or even look up to because she never ever in a million years fails. There is no "why" in this movie, just "is" to prove a point that only the paid are interested in. The Rebels are forgettable, uninteresting, and not important to the franchise. AND WORST OF ALL THE LIGHTSABER BATTLES ARE TERRIBLY CHOREOGRAPHED. It's like the saber wielders have lost all sense of ability and form and now are just randomly swinging their sword cause "feelings". That's a huge problem in both of the newer entries of Star Wars is it focuses too much on feelings. And that may be because the directors or whoever are trying to pander to women (wrongly), and assuming that fans that are women are more interested in emotional outbursts than an epic space opera. This movies attempt at pro-feminism absolutely does injustice to that realm of political thought making out strong women characters to be both **** incompetent, or outright fantastical and unrelatable. This movie is a real disappointment. You are probably safe to assume the last installment will be ****e also. Happy Holiday season, etc etc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I felt compelled to this time however due to the PR spin the powers that be are trying to put on this movie. The fans are upset. The fans do not like this movie. I (and many others i am sure) are done with the star wars franchise.<br/><br/>This movie completely **** on the previous material. This movie has little to no respect for the source material and is essentially a long toy commercial. Nothing eventful happens in this movie. nothing. Luke dying isnt even important. He wasnt there to start with. Now he is dead. The situation didnt change. The "rebellion" is in the same **** shape as when the movie started. Apparently, destroying the first orders super weapon in episode 7 didnt phase the first order. It didnt inspire the galaxy to fight back like destroying the death star inspired people. The characters in this movie do not have to actually work for any rewards. i would make the same claim to the **** director of this movie. He really phoned it in. Kylo has had training since he was young in the ways of the force and in combat. Rey is apparently on par with him with no training. I hear all the trendies defending this by saying "the force made her stronger" well thats great. She has more force power now. wonderful. it doesnt mean **** if she doesnt KNOW HOW TO USE IT. i could give you all the gasoline you could hold. without a car, tell me how fast that gas makes you go? Just "having power" doesnt mean **** unless you know how to use it. There are so many things i could point out here that are just simply idiotic but i dont believe i am going to be changing peoples minds. Either you like it or you dont. It just seems to me that everyone who "liked it" only look on the surface of things. they are entertained by pretty lights, a ****ty romance that they are setting up between ray and kylo. the ****ty romance that happened all of a sudden between the fat asian plumber and the token black guy. then the inevitable love triangle cause the token black guy fell in love with ray in the same super fast what the **** way in the first movie as fat asian plumber did in this. This is the problem with fandoms getting into the mainstream. Instead of actually having to have quality in writing/story telling, the mega corps can just cash in on the trendies and the name of the product. RIP star wars. i wont be seeing another movie in this brand.<br/><br/>TL;DR - the fans are actually upset. dont let your own spin fool you disney, you ****ed up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Director of The Last Jedi had little regard for creating continuity from the previous film.  This movie also has several of the problems of the previous film of the sequal trilogy, The Force Awakens, such as the characters are very shallow and 1 demensial and are more or less more a "diverse" version of the original film.  The protaganist Rey is the ultimate Mary Sue, and the antagonist Kylo Ren is not a very intimidating villian espically compared to pass star wars villians such as Darth Vader and Darth Maul.<br/><br/>The actions scenes were exciting but if you're a long time fan of Star Wars you will be sure to be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It contained an ungodly amount of plot holes, including one that ruins all of the Star Wars franchise.<br/><br/>Character development is entirely ignored. Luke does things that are so out of character, the only way i could see Disney saving this train wreck is a total wipe of what has happened. I don't think Rian Johnson even watched any of the previous movies, it really doesn't seem like it. This movie was a disservice to the universe, the characters, and especially the fans young and old. I really hope Disney goes for a nuclear option in episode 9 and scraps much of what happened in this movie. Make the events of this movie a crazy dream if you have to. Total garbage. Here are a more concentrated list of issues: 1. The Death of Luke<br/>2. Luke’s Legacy & Behavior<br/>3. The Death of Snoke<br/>4. Finn & Rose’s Subplot<br/>5. Rey’s Parents are Nobody<br/>6. Death & Return of Leia<br/>7. Death of Phasma<br/>8. Humor & Tone Issues<br/>9. Dropped Force Awakens Subplots<br/>10. Plot Holes<br/>11. First Order Fleet Chases instead of Destroys<br/>12. Vice Admiral Holdo Sucks<br/>13. A Single X-Wing can Destroy a Dreadnought<br/>14. Why didnt Kylo notice Luke Projection<br/>15. Knights of Ren Dropped<br/>16. Kylo Ren & Vader Relationship Dropped<br/>17. Rey Perfect Saber Techniques with No Training<br/>18. Snoke doesnt know his ship can track the enemy?<br/>19. Yoda looks weird! (and can control lighting?)<br/>20. Rey happens to be at correct spot to save everyone and lifts all rocks with no training.<br/>21. Why was Finn hurt if it has no ramifications?<br/>22.

Now we know what a feminist take on Star Wars is like, apparently its like Transformers, but that wouldn't be fair, the robots have more character than the soulless husks of "identity" politics we see on screen here. They even brought in a pink hair for good measure, because woman strong!  There are countless things wrong with this movie, but I don't feel like clicking the spoiler box, its a joke to pretend this movie could be spoiled when its already rotten.<br/><br/>At this point the rebels #resist are little more than incompetent terrorists led by women, if the goal of these movies was to get me to root for the Empire, congrats, job done.  I can only wish the Empire would win and put this shambling corpse of a franchise out of its misery.<br/><br/>Its not so much that the sacred was destroyed, as some people like to mis-characterize fanboy reactions, its that they took something good, something with potential, and they spat all over it with their progressive politics, throwing away things they did not understand had value because their ideology blinds them to human reality, even natural human interaction evades the progressives grasp now.  These are people who believe everyone is the same, yet different, yet interchangeable, their incoherent world view and ignorance of tradition and history yields cultural destruction like this.  The modern Mao's red guard are the Kathleen Kennedy and #imwithher types, and you are seeing now why they cannot be trusted with power.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They could have cut out around 40% of the content and it never would have hurt, especially the scenes like the casino that feel like diseny not like star wars, never did a scene so badly need a Hutt and there wasn't one to be found anywhere. The whole thing felt like it was preparing for a disney themed ride. They could never be satisifed with a one off witty comment, but had to include multiple joke beats back and forth beating a dead horse. The highlight moment of the film quickly palls as Kylo Ren goes from being actually scary and interesting as a Sith back to being a whiny little tantrum throwing crybaby. Luke's entire acting felt uninspired and I can understand why given that it was basically a deconstruction of his original character. This movie went through three directors, and it really really shows, as the conflict between 'don't believe in past heroes' and 'listen to your elders and betters' waves back and forth so hard it gives whiplash.<br/><br/>That said, it had some amazing action sequences, pity they were so few and far between because they were by far the strongest points in the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was strongest, sadly, when it felt like it was directly reskinning parts of The Empire Strikes back. The planet where the battle goes down with At-Ats and such is so close to Hoth that they literally had to have some guy lick the white ground and say 'it's salt' to make it clear this wasn't a snowy frozen world. This thing copies Empire almost scene for scene in places, with new characters and a new skin, and but has completely changed the underlying message of the story while keeping the same general plot structure.<br/><br/>I can't say it was horrible, but it was definitely not starwars, and it's left me sad for the ending of the trilogy. Maybe if they could get a single director to stop **** around and just run with the old 'saturday morning matinee' flair the originals had, it would work, but directly copying the plot structure without the inherent techniques will never make this work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In retrospect, the movie became my personal favorite from the original trilogy. The Last Jedi will share a similar fate. Angry fans struggling to let go of heroes and ideas from the last millennium will eventually return to the movie and see its full value. 1) Luke was always flawed and whiny--return to those "Uncle Owens" in Episode IV. Han, Leia and Luke will not provide a solution--a new generation is necessary to find an ultimate solution and to continue the story. Let go. 2) The notion behind the force has always been complex and shared a diverse religious foundation. The notion of a Christian good and evil was always mixed with a Taoist notion of yin and yang. The Taoist leaning of The Last Jedi is consistent with the direction of The Clone Wars. Let go. 3) The capabilities of the force are not a known quantity confined by previous movies. Astral projection across the universe seems at least as plausible as immortality. Let go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie has ruined Luke Skywalkers character, made the Imperial faction’s officers into jokes and comical reliefs, there is no consistency in the movie when it comes to morale (OK for the rebel vice admiral to suicide attack, but not when Finn wants to … it’s OK to kill and eat fish, but not OK to eat flying penguins .. and so on), this movie is so political correctly loaded that one wants to throw up (the rich 1% are cruel to animals, use child slaves, sell weapons to all sides and want to have war … bla bla bla) and like 33% of this movie is about a pointless side mission that has no meaning in the overall plot, with two characters who have no role in the overall plot (Finn and Rose). On top of all this, one could write a book about how Star Wars 8 breaks (or violates) tons of Star Wars canon and continuity. Overall: Disney has killed Star Wars as we knew it, and a new money grinding machine monster is born :-(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I found it ridiculous that they felt it necessary to have a short cameo by Chubakka, a short cameo by R2D2 and CP3O. Mark Hamills performance was unenthusiastic, unbelievable and boring.  The CGI scenes of the battle scenes grew redundant and unbelievable.  And what is the deal with GEN Leiha getting blown out into outer space and then returning to her ship?  Did she use her jedi powers to do that or what? Basically they need to bury the Star Wars franchise.

It has fun, exciting moments and I found myself genuinely invested when tension rose; however, there are segments in the film that made me say, "Really?" out loud. Each scene has great ideas but when combined together, they make a movie with mixed tones and create pacing issues that negatively impact the humor and emotional connections with the characters. The special effects are great, the main characters undergo some much needed development and the acting is good, but subpar secondary characters, uneven pacing and plot holes make it difficult to care. Overall, Episode VIII is fun to watch but leaves much to be desired.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I liked The Force Awakens, as it did a good enough job of establishing new characters and restarting a worthy new trilogy post-Lucas, but it ultimately felt a bit like fan fiction. The Last Jedi did what it needed to do. It has weight to it. I have small complaints, like I do about all the Star Wars movies, but it is an exciting, fun, and moving experience. Luke's arc was wonderful and has me replaying it repeatedly in my head with butterflies in my stomach. And Snoke, wow. So good. I imagine most people don't care about spoilers by now, but I'll still just leave it all at that, just in case. If you love Star Wars and haven't seen it yet, don't listen to all the negativity. Great, great stuff, and actually built to last. Again, not to rip on TFA too much, but it just isn't really very good for repeated viewings or even that fun to think a lot about afterward--other than wanting to see where it was going to go next. I am very glad that The Last Jedi is where it went.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

That's literally the only thing this movie had going for it. The script was awful, the characters had no progression, Luke would never act that way (even mark hamill did not like the script). I did my best to filter out all the disney propaganda pushed into this film (it is the MOST preachy star wars film to date), even then there was nothing there. Who is Rey? Nobody. Who is The Great Leader Snork? Who knows. Do bombs fall in space? Yes. At least Luke got to drink himself some green space walrus **** milk. That's what we've waited 40 years for, a crazy hobo Luke who failed to accomplish anything who dies from a force stroke.. or constipation.. or whatever tf happened at the end. Maybe if Mark Hamill in real life was a minority they would have let him be less of a loser. 90+% on rotten tomato, yeah we should all know whats rotten about that site. These critics are bought and paid for. I'm sure they'll delete half of these reviews claiming that it's all bots by the 'evil alt right'... full of **** Everyone I've talked to, all the youtube reviews i watched, at least 90% felt it was meh to total crap. They killed star wars (again) with this turd, the director should never be hired again. In fact i'm going to go out of my way to NEVER watch another film by that prick. I hope they dont screw up their comic franchises next or I'll be about done with disney.

No, I'm not saying that because I expected something different and am disappointed. No, I am not saying that because a beloved character dies. I am saying this because the movie has poor pacing, poor tone, completely self-contradictory and illogical plot movements, plot holes everywhere, no character arch, and simultaneously destroys any hope of the new characters being interesting AND the legacy of old heroes. The "gotcha" reversal of expectations moves, which became horribly predictable, were nauseating. The comedy never landed, and destroyed the tone. The feminist and animal activist politics were completely overbearing (and self-contradictory). At every opportunity to create good character development, the movie falls flat. Do we need to talk about alien boob milking, ships that go exactly the same speed for an entire film, useless Canto Bite missions, dying from over-meditation, or any of the other nonsensical events? Do we really need to go there? Because I can. Trust me when I say: this is not the Star Wars you were looking for. Avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie was great. How can you hate a movie like this? There was jokes in serious moments? Yes there were few of them, but all of you forget the original trilogy, if you watch them again, humor is also present in serious situations, oh yes it is, maybe in old fashion but yes. I totally understand why Luke acted the way he did, and I loved the way he died, like Obi Wan and Yoda. The only thing I did not like about this movie was how Leia survived that attack at the beginning, I mean I know it is a fantasy, but again it was to much. And also, I wanted to see more from C3PO, R2D2 and Chewie cuzz everytime I see them there is a smile on my face. For me, this movie takes place behind episode 4 and 5, on third position. This is just my opinion... :) I know I will get a lot of dislikes, but it is okay, I just wanted to share this with you guys, there is still a hope inside me. May the force be with you...<br/><br/>Sorry for my bad english</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Stupid complaints:<br/>Luke misrepresented - He was meant to be broken down, he had failed those he had trained. Could have done with a proper duel at the end though. Leia saving herself in space - Lol, didn't people know she was Luke's sister.<br/>Humour - Apart from the call scene at the start most of them worked, especially the Chewie eating the Porg scene and Luke drinking the milk scene. There was similar humour in TFA, yet now people complain. Porg - Quite funny overall, especially in the Chewie scenes. None of the aliens seemed like a Disney cash grab.<br/>Probably a 7-8, the lack of lightsaber duels and Snoke being completely disregarded the main complaints.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As a stand-alone movie it's fine; but when you put it as the second film in a cannon Star Wars trilogy; completely unmaking the first film in the new trilogy, it's not fine at all.<br/><br/>Every character returns, exactly as you knew them in Episode VII! Yes, every character is the same as the first movie. In fact, there is no character development in this movie at all; it’s like they wanted to remake the first movie; it’s only been a couple years! It’s not a problem if you don’t know who Snoke is, or who Rey’s parents were; because it never mattered, boy how clever; straight out of the “M. Night” twist playbook!<br/><br/>I didn’t have an issue with Han Solo dying in Episode VII, because Harrison Ford wanted that character to die off a long time ago. Killing off Luke, especially in the way they did, was a very unattractive move to a lot of people; in fact, Luke’s whole journey in this movie is the complete opposite of what it was in the original trilogy. They effectively unmade the original trilogy. It’s like, if someone were to make a sequel to Citizen Kane, but made every character you love into a child murderer. Why would Luke want to kill Kylo just because he “sensed” he went to the dark side in his heart? Luke literally tried to turn the most iconic fictional evil villain in history back to the light; Darth Vader, and he succeeded in the end! Princess Leah is also an iconic fictional character, and she floats through space like a champ too; also, where the hell did she learn how to do that? If Leah can float through space with force abilities and no training, did Jedi even need space ships at all in the Clone Wars?<br/><br/>So, we’re supposed to “let the past die”, and accept that the main characters are at conflict now, and were in the past, for seemingly no reason at all. There is no reason for Kylo Ren to be on the “dark side”, and there is no reason for Rey to be on the "light side". Nothing matters in this movie, and that’s a big problem, especially for episode 9, and the entire future of Star Wars itself. They not only effectively unmade Star Wars, they made it pointless now too. Disney just wants to make and sell some “Team Kylo” T-shirts, that’s all they care about.<br/><br/>If I were directing Episode 9, I would have Finn wake up from his coma from the first film, and be like "Wow, that was one hell of a nightmare"; that way episode VIII never happened.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie was disconnected mush - painfully lurching between consumer product placement and future theme park rides. A few sad motivational speeches mixed in. Plot, etc, if any, was laughable. The cinematography was often beautiful, but the end result was garbage: as ridiculous as Space Balls -- just not as funny. I feel bad for all the artists, designers, etc who all must have worked hard on this. Anyway, I'm not an obsessive Star Wars fan, but as a 41 yo, I grew up with these movies.

She just magically becomes a Jedi after less than 18 hours of training (her training was intercut with the slow-speed, OJ's white Bronco-style space chase in which they said they only had 18 hours of fuel left) and one lesson that she completely botched (she messes around with a lightsaber too, but Luke just watches her from far away--guess she's got that covered).  But what's worse is that she doesn't even really want to be a Jedi!  In FORCE AWAKENS, she's constantly avoiding the idea (when she finds Luke's lightsaber, she says, "I don't want it!" and runs away, and right before that she tells Han she just wants to go home).  And the force, to her, seems more like an annoyance.  She's always talking about this thing that's inside her like it's an ulcer or something that she's trying to get rid of, and when Luke asks her what she thinks the force is, she's really flippant and gives him some stupid answer about "you know...lifting rocks and stuff."  No reverence, awe, wonder or curiosity whatsoever.  Wouldn't be so bad if she eventually learned something and grew to appreciate these awesome abilities, but she treats Luke and the caretakers like total garbage.  Her only motivation for anything she does in any of these movies seems to be...well, I have to because the Luke Skywalker character in these ones is a girl this time.<br/><br/>Then when the third act comes around, the movie just throws up its hands and gives up on Rey.  She all but disappears during the finale except to fly around and shoot TIE fighters from the Millenium Falcon's laser turret, which we've established time and time again is something that any character can do.  And then the final sick joke in which she lifts some rocks--her mockery of the force brought full circle--as if Rian Johnson was listening to Weird Al's "Yoda" while writing.<br/><br/>I suppose I somewhat enjoyed the ending.  I actually didn't mind Luke's story in this movie--it's okay to let a character go dark as they age, no matter how good they might have been before.  But it was so Luke-centric that the other characters got sidelined.  I was really hoping the new characters--Finn, Rey, Kylo, Phasma--would be developed more in this one, but they don't do anything. Even worse, they don't seem to WANT anything!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's supposed to take decades of studying in order to become proficient at utilizing the force and a lightsaber. All Luke did was tell Rey the definition of what the force is. Becoming a Jedi or Sith is a dedication of one's life to learning the mystery's of the force, it is a lifestyle, you can't become a Jedi just by learning the definition of the force. Anakin Skywalker, the chosen one, did not become a powerhouse immediately. It took him decades to hone his force and lightsaber abilities before he reached his prime. For example, if someone told me the definition of “Law”, I can’t just go immediately pass the bar exam and become a lawyer. I would have to dedicate several years studying in law school just to pass the bar exam. The fact that Rey was able to use the force and a lightsaber as effectively as she did in the movie is a blatant violation of the Star Wars mythos.<br/><br/>There are seven lightsaber forms (Shii-Cho, Makashi, Soresu, Ataru, Shien/Djem So, Niman, and Juyo/Vaapad) that can take years just to master one of them. It takes at least one year to learn the first lightsaber form Shii-Cho(Form One), which is the lightsaber form that all Jedi must learn first as it teaches the basics of wielding a lightsaber. Shii-Cho(Form One) is the most basic of all forms and is taught to Jedi younglings as a foundation, and includes the fundamentals of stance, attack, parry, and landing a “Mark of Contact”. The strengths of Shii-Cho (Form One) are that it is the best form against multiple opponents and has good blaster deflection. However, Shii-Cho (Form One) weakness is that it’s the least suitable form for lightsaber dueling. Meaning even if Rey had mastered Shii-Cho(Form One), she would have been guaranteed to be defeated by Kylo Ren in a lightsaber duel. For Kylo Ren had studied under Luke Skywalker and Snoke for years. As a result, Kylo Ren would have been able to learn more of the advanced lightsaber forms that are better suited for lightsaber combat, which would give him the edge over Rey. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It set the new trilogy.  He set the next director up with what should have been a slam dunk — just execute on the well developed ideas in the Force Awakens.  This movie is such utter garbage that it defies explanation.  Too many plot holes.  Far too much poorly timed comedy.  Too much politicizing.  And worst of all no real character development.<br/><br/>The way they portrayed Luke was a total disaster and was not believable, given his already strongly developed character. Total waste of time and money.  Terrible movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Diversity has really ruined the movie. Finn wasn't easy to look at. He's ugly. The story at the end was predictable. I believe that this movie has killed Carrie Fisher, I would have a heart attack too after seeing this movie that I am in. I felt like I wasted $20 on this. I really wanted it to be the best movie because it is Star Wars. The fight and battle weren't intense enough. So focus on diversity, Asian and African American. Kylo being shirtless, eww, not sexy at all. Rey didn't really do anything. Seem like the Dark side won, the Light side just running away, should have listened to Poe Dameron. He seems to be more like Harrison Ford. He would have become a new friend with Chewbecca. Rian, don't mess with Star Wars anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
