The rest of the 'jedi' part of The Last Jedi was almost equally terrific. Unfortunately the 'b' plot is underwhelming and ultimately pointless, and it drags the rest of the film down a couple of notches. Still, it's a strong overall addition to the franchise, regardless of the reactionary nerdrage it has engendered in some corners that have sadly come out to taint its score here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I felt Laura Dern's character and Rose were shoehorned in.  Those characters needed some character development.  When Rose was injured and Laura Dern's character suicides I just had zero feeling about them. The special effects were A+ as always and the Rey/Kylo Storyline was decent.  While I can understand some of the more passionate fanboys disappointment, I think we just have to take these movies for what they are.

The first two-thirds of this movie are extremely sluggish, with pretty much nothing happening when the camera is on Ray and Luke. After Ray boards Snoke's ship, the movie really picks up and becomes very interesting and entertaining. The other problem is a REALLY ANNOYING plot thing. When Rose and Finn are about to be executed, the ship blows up. All of the clones around them are either dead or knocked out, and Rose and Finn just get back up and say "I know where a working ship is!" That was really lucky that R and F are okay when everybody else is either knocked out or dead! Another problem is some of the humor was pretty cheap. The acting is pretty good in this movie, and it really built up Kilo Ren's character. He was very well acted in this movie and now one of the most interesting Star Wars characters to me. All in all, the final third of this movie is really great, but the first two-thirds drag for the most part.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It’s definitely the most interesting one.  When it's best, it's better than all the new movies, but it occasionally makes obvious missteps The Force Awakens didn't.   I’ll list my favorite parts of the movie, and then my criticisms.  Kylo Ren.   I didn’t like Kylo in TFA, mostly because he was some kid who kept losing his temper and didn’t seem particularly strong.   But Rian Johnson’s Kylo Ren is menacing and complex.  Kylo passed up the chance to murder his mother, but he was totally uninterested in saving the rebellion when he had the chance.   Kylo is able to hide his true intentions from Snoke, allowing him to kill Snoke.   But he’s also impulsive and easy to manipulate, as Luke shows towards the end.   Kylo Ren is my favorite new character in TLJ.   Rey is spunky, and Poe is charming, but Kylo is easily the most conflicted, multi-dimensional character left in the Star Wars universe.    For the most part, TLJ captures the tone and spirit of the original trilogy.   The amazing orchestral music.  The beautiful landscapes.   The brisk, tense battles.   Critically, TLJ doesn’t spend too much time on frivolous backstory, and instead lets its characters show who they are through current dialogue and actions.  These are all things the good Star Wars movies have done right.   And now, the bad parts:<br/><br/>Star Wars has always blended drama with humor well, but under Rian Johnsons’ guidance, the humor sometimes falls flat, and the drama is heavy handed.   Everyone is a smart ass in TLJ.   All the time.   When I watched the movie, no one laughed when Luke threw the light saber Rey gave him over his shoulder.   It was too odd (and unoriginal) for a Star Wars movie.   I’d estimate that something like this happens at least 6 times in the film.   One critic who hated TLJ said that the movie was trying too hard to be like Guardians of the Galaxy.   I agree.   TLJ won’t age well because of this.   Yet by far the worse part about TLJ is how ham-fisted Rian Johnson’s drama is.   Star Wars has always been a black and white saga, but it was handled well in the original trilogy because Lucas’ messaging was subtle.   Okay, the Rebels were kind of like the Vietcong, and the Empire was kind of like the Nazis, but not really.   People don’t call Darth Vader their favorite movie villain because he’s like Hitler.   Subtle messaging allows your characters to transcend petty editorializing, and take on lives of their own.   Rian Johnson apparently doesn’t know this.   The end of the move, where a kid stares into space because he feels hope, is an example of this.   It's already been beaten over our heads that the rebellion represents hope.  What the audience needs to see is the main characters, the people they actually got to know and learned how to relate to, feel hope.  Think of the powerful last scene in Empire where Luke, Leia, and co. were staring into space.   It resonates with the audience because we know we’ll be on that journey with them.   Unless Disney makes a new Star Wars movie every year for three decades, no one is going to make a movie about the slave kid.   He’s a pawn in Rian Johnson’s sentimental Hallmark movie scene.   And seriously, how many times do we need to hear that we don’t need the past?   Rey doesn’t need old Jedi wisdom, because it’s already in her?  **** gag me.   Transcending the past would be a more convincing theme if it wasn’t also Kylo Ren’s motivation for murdering his dad.  And don’t even get me started on TLJ’s adolescent take on arms dealing and rich people.  Conservative critics have gone too far in dismissing TLJ as SJW propaganda.  But if they could stop overstating their case, they would have a point.   TLJ definitely goes out of its way to be feminist.  There is never, ever, a guy rescuing a girl in the heat of a battle.  Rey saves Kylo from Snoke’s elite guards.   Rose saves Finn.   Also, there is conspicuously no male leadership in the Rebellion.   Contrast this with The First Order, which is almost exclusively white and male, especially their leadership.   Patronizing is the nicest thing one can say about Johnson’s portrayal of gender.   TLJ's shallow, rah-rah feminism is hard not to un-see, but still easy to get over since there is so much else going on in the movie.<br/><br/>The only surprising thing about Johnson’s messaging is that Finn kissed a girl, and not Poe.  Finally, I was disappointed in Johnson’s Luke Skywalker.   Again, it’s mostly due to Johnson generally being as subtle as Donald Trump’s Tweets.  I don’t mind old and crusty Luke.   But Luke’s twisted face in both of the unnecessary scenes where he's standing over Kylo Ren with a lightsaber highlights how ugly luke was.    Again, I liked TLJ.   It’s also a lot easier to talk about the things you didn’t like than the ones you did. I need to see TLJ again to refine my take.  I look forward to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie was visually stunning and Mark Hamill and Adam Driver had awesome performances.  The major problem with this movie is that it ignores basic storytelling aspects.  This is supposed to be part of a trilogy which indicates that the story has some internal consistency.  If this was a stand alone movie the writer/director can make their own decisions.  Rian Johnson cast away every major decision that was laid out in the previous film.  Some have likened it the children playing the game add to the story with a sentence until it gets to one who totally changes the story that came from those before.  This movie had an inverse of the Empire Strikes Back story.  Several of the characters serve no purpose.  Major changes in the force made absolutely no sense when you look at previously established movies.  People say there are bold choices.  It is not bold to totally ignore established plot lines.  So much is desperately wrong with this movie and the fact that the studio insults the intelligence of the audience makes it necessary to rate it even lower.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7996662"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This movie is a dumpster fire of a bad movie. Faulty logic, poorly handled characters, plot holes that are too many to count, no synergy with any of the characters (except Rey and Kylo), and lazy terrible writing. Not to mention shoving down our throats political messages galore.<br/><br/>Let's start with the start of the movie. The beginning space battle is a case study on how NOT to portray a space battle. If you want to see how it is really done right, go see Rogue One. That ending space battle was fantastic. Not only was it visually exciting, but it was fairly accurate on how air battles are run. The notion that you would "drop" bombs...IN SPACE is patently ridiculous. How stupid do you expect the audience to be??? There are viewers who are above the age of 2. And let's take for granted that there is some type of tech that allows objects to counter act the void of space and produce some type of gravity/magnetic "bubble", it STILL makes ZERO strategic sense! Poe had cleared the dreadnought of surface cannons (which I find AMAZING for a single X-wing fighter), why take the chance of continuing to put your people and bombers into harms way??? You are telling me you can affix that payload onto missiles that can be launched from a safer distance away? That whole scene is just stupid all all around.<br/><br/>Secondly, who in their right mind believes that they handled Luke Skywalker in the proper way??? Luke Skywalker, a hopeful and optimistic man, was able to see a sliver of light in a Darth Vader (his father Anikan Skywalker) who for decades has committed genocide and atrocities. And he believed that he was worthy of being redeemed and saved!!! But for an instant saw some darkness in his own nephew, his SISTER'S and BEST FRIEND'S son, and thought he deserved to be struck down...MURDERED, at the swing of a lightsaber. That is the dumbest bit of writing for that character and clearly demonstrates how little Rian Johnson and Disney understand how to handle such an iconic character.<br/><br/>Third, that space chase was long, boring, illogical, and the story arch went NO WHERE. OK, let's give them that they have the tech to track them through hyperspace. Fine. The chase at sub-light speed is on. You can't send a second contingent of ships or fleet to hyperspace in from of their trajectory to form a pincer movement??? Again, VERY lazy writing to try to force a plot that sucked to begin with. Flying Leia?!? No, JUST NO. And where she came into the ship on, there aren't any air locks? Everything else about that scene sucked, I guess why not. The ONLY thing that worked was the scene where Kylo hesitates to fire on his mother but then the other tie fighters in his squadron does so in his stead. This scene clearly cements the seeds of hesitation in him (It had been planted in him long before). To just have Leia die at this moment would have at least furthered Kylo's story arch. But no, we get Harry Potter Princess Leia. Vice Admiral Holdo. WHY WAS SHE IN THIS MOVIE?!? Just to have another female heroine? And her character STUNK!!! Not telling Poe what her plan was is just dumb. This of course forces Poe to conspire with Finn and Rose in what would be the crappiest amount of filler that amounted to NOTHING FOR THE OVERALL STORY in the Star Wars Universe. "Was it worth it" Lord, epic stupidity strikes again. You go through all of that to save alien space race horses, but I guess it's OK to let those slaves remain slaves. Look I am not for abusing animals, but did we have to be lectured on this in a Star Wars movie????? And the answer is, NOOOO it wasn't worth it!!! Your mission was to find a code breaker to get you onto the First Order ship to deactivate or destroy that tracker so that you could save the Resistance! It was to help make Rose's sister's sacrifice meaningful and to help save Rey if she came back! That whole Canto Bight story arch was a total disaster.<br/><br/>Forth, if Luke Skywalker really does teach young padawans the ways of the Force like he did with Rey, it's no wonder Kylo said, "Screw this, I'm out of here to find a real teacher!" and destroyed Luke's Jedi academy! "Just reach out with your emotions." Oh man. Brutal. The writing totally stunk! It took Luke weeks, perhaps months on Dagobah with Yoda, physically training, mentally training, spiritually training to become a Jedi. Who in their right mind believes that even with talent, that without hard dedication, perseverance and training that you can ever realize becoming ANYTHING much less a Jedi????? That notion simply spits on everything we know to be true. Rey has no character growth. She's instantly great at everything! What a boring waste of a character. And YES!!! She shouldn't have been NOBODY, but the daughter of LUKE!<br/><br/>Fifth, Killing Snoke like you did. WTF! You build up this character like you did in TFA and give us ZERO??? HE was the new Darth Vader! He had gravitas. He struck fear in people and made people believe was a real threat. Not Kylo.<br/><br/>It Stunk!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

One of the worst things I've ever seen in a theater.  The opening ten minutes are the most infuriating, illogical, tonally disjointed, poorly edited, humorless, heart-string pulling scenes I've ever seen in a film.  The film only falls apart when Mary Sue meets the curmudgeon Luke Skywalker, who promptly throws his lightsaber that he hasn't seen since it was chopped off of his hand in The Empire Strikes back, and just chucks it behind his back for a cheap laugh.  Everything is a farce, their is proper dialogue and then there is the kind of drivel exchanged between these meaningless husks of what some might call the characters in this fecal material.  Why is Luke completely out of character in this film?  He may as well be another person, why even bother having the original cast members in this film, if ultimately they just don't want to be there and would rather be killed off for contrived reasons instead?  The very fact that the only "surviving" actress in the screenplay happens to be Carrie Fisher, may she rest in peace, shows you what Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill thought of the scripts for both films.  I can imagine them sitting there saying something along the lines of, "just kill me off, I don't care how you do it, just don't make it too embarrassing or something."<br/><br/>Without the backbone of these pivotal actors, the original cast, meant to overshadow them, instead completely fall flat on their faces.  Rey is devoid of any development she is essentially given even more super powers in this film so that the plot can move along, Poe is just a hothead ace pilot who may as well have the "force" too given how impressive his "plot" armor is.  That brings us to Finn, who should have arguably been the main character in both this movie and the Force Awakens, is reduced to a side-character who is actually side-lined for some random unattractive Asian women instead.  He participates in a meaningless Casino planet subplot that has nothing to do with anything in the story.  In fact the only real star here is Adam Driver, who not only has an arc, but in fact grows as a character.  He really seems to be trying to make Kylo "Ben" Ren into something more than a goofy kid playing with a plastic lightsaber in front of a green screen.  Mark Hamill is underutilized, their are glaring inconsistencies that make no comprehensible sense.  Luke shows up as an astral projection wielding a blue lightsaber, rather than his own green light saber, you know the one he built after having his hand chopped off in the Empire Strikes back.  Considering how much is ripped off from the original trilogy, its surprising that the people who wrote it are in fact so stupid as to forget all that.  Carrie Fisher shows her age, its like listening to a senile old woman cosplaying as Princess Leia (You know she ain't no princess no more guys).  Why hide the plan from Poe?  Why was purple hair lady so important?  Why did Luke drink blue milk from the balls of some alien walrus monstrosity?  How exactly does a ship hyperdrive through another ship when they mention that the ship is incredibly low on "space" fuel, and they clearly just spent the last of it on gassing up the transporters?  How exactly WOULD a ship even lightspeed through another ship?  I'm fairly certain it was brought up once, Han Solo mentioned something to the effect of, "you need to have specific coordinates or you could accidentally end up in a star, or a planet, etc.." That's all well in good, but I'm sure that spaceships, probably have a way of deterring this radical strategy, probably by having certain things in place like say deflector shields, or possible a device onboard that would never allow this to actually occur.  Otherwise it would've happened once before, or been mentioned at least once by someone at some point.  How come Leia has space force powers?  I wasn't aware the force could protect you from the vacuum of space.  Does that mean everyone who opened the door when she floated on up to it also had the force and that's how they weren't sucked out into ****  Then what about that Asian lady on the first bomber over the dreadnaught?  She was clearly in **** outerspace, and yet was not sucked out into it while dropping the bombs in an environment where their is no gravity.  What a waste of time, what a waste of a film, what a waste of potential all around.  What a disingenuous, sad, disgusting, shocking, insulting and irrational way to end the series for fans.  I can assure you, many people will not be going to see the last installment, mostly because you'd have to somehow undo how stupid and supremely miscalculated this film was.  I say, throw it all out, let it burn, let it die, mark it as non-canon and don't spend a dime on Disney's new first order.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The writing is simply bad and cringe-worthy especially the dialogue.  There are just simply too many WTF moments. I am not a die-hard Star Wars fan but what they did with this is just wrong. I gave them the benefit of the doubt after disliking EP 7 The Force Awakens, but they delivered nothing on the setups in that movie, it is like it never happened.<br/><br/>So why should I care what happens in this movie and in this trilogy when you negated the point of the Original Trilogy (Ep.4-6) and destroyed Luke as a character? With this movie and this whole trilogy you are just demonstrating that you will just create more and more future movies without care for the universe that exists. Dumping the entire extended universe demonstrates the lack of care for this. They could have started a new trilogy set a few hundred years into the future or even a millennia later without destroying what was. The whole point of the Original Trilogy was the restoration of the Republic and the destruction of the Empire. What happens a few decades later? The Jedi are practically extinct. The Empire is simply morphed into the all powerful First Order. The Republic seems to have never been restored and the Rebels morphed into the resistance that by the end of the movie is practically nonexistent. There are a ton of questions left unanswered and will likely not get answered.<br/><br/>Lets not forget the stupid setup for a kids movie trilogy in the Star Wars universe that killed the pacing for this move.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

How would the change of directors affect the story? Would the film crew be able to adapt to Carrie Fisher's unexpected passing? Most of all, would episode 8 live up to the high expectations? Star Wars: The Last Jedi takes a lot of bold steps, sometimes not in the most clear direction. The movie essentially has two separate plots: one with Rey meeting the legendary Luke Skywalker, and the other featuring the Resistance as they attempt to evade the First Order yet again. One of the main problems lies in that the secondary plot with the Resistance has serious pacing issues, and does not seem be as satisfying as the moments we spend with Rey and Luke. I say satisfying because the entire point of the secondary plot with Finn and a new character, Rose, seems to have very little payoff, and is almost pointless with the exception of the last scene of the film. Their goal was to find a way to evade the First Order, and it ended up failing anyway. Rey and Luke is far more interesting, and it is great to see the chemistry between the characters, but the humor between them feels forced at times. The same humor incorporated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes back in The Last Jedi, and oftentimes it does not work. Must be a Disney thing. John Williams returns to compose the music for the film, and he does as great as ever. This might be one of the best sounding Star Wars films, and quite easily the best looking. The CGI and the cinematography are breathtaking.<br/><br/>Adam Driver reprises his role as Kylo Ren, and once again does a fantastic job. While fans seem to be split on whether or not Kylo is a strong villain, I believe he is one of the most compelling characters in all of the Star Wars movies. During the scenes where Kylo and Rey come into contact, physically or via some force projection, they steal the show. What I really liked with The Last Jedi is the departure from the conventional light versus dark side themes; instead, both Rey and Kylo experience inner turmoil as they grapple with what they believe is the right path. The psychological battles that both characters undergo are as intense as they are thematic. Kylo's relationship with Luke proves to be equally as intriguing, and learning about their backstory and how it led into the events of The Last Jedi further turned those conventional themes on their heads.<br/><br/>One of the most mysterious characters in the last film was Supreme Leader Snoke, and we finally get to see a physical character of him. Snoke is easily one of the most intriguing characters in the film. Unfortunately, we do not get to see much of him in the film, and after seeing the movie, we are unlikely to see any more of him, for better or worse. I understand the thought process behind Rian Johnson's decision regarding Snoke because it means we will see more of Kylo, but it all felt abrupt how they handled it. Another major character that was handled questionably was Princess Leia, who dies during a space battle, but returns to life by the force. Those who have paid attention during the previous Star Wars films knows Leia has a connection to the force through the Skywalker bloodline, but I do not understand why they brought her back considering the fact that Carrie Fisher passed away, and it has been stated that she will not be in the next movie at all. The only silver lining is we are treated to a reunion between Luke and Leia before the final battle, but even that could have been done in a different way somehow. Once the stories of Rey and the Resistance start to link up, the movie does pick up considerably, and the climax is coming up. Well, that is not entirely true. The movie still has about an hour to go, which is not a good sign for a movie being told concisely and put together well. I thought the movie had ended multiple times, but it kept going. The entire movie does feel messy, and while I love more Star Wars, I do not like a movie that has a lacking identity. Here I think lies the movie's biggest flaw: it tried to do a lot while really doing nothing. The movie could be cut considerably and it would still tell the same story essentially. There are some awkward moments, times where character rationales do not make a lot of sense, questionable decisions with major characters, and pacing issues, but overall these little problems are under the umbrella of the movie not being as concise as it should have been. A lot of the movie feels like filler, which means more Star Wars, but a worse movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an entertaining movie, but whether or not it is a "good" movie remains in question. This film will definitely leave fans debating and complaining. It seems that a lot of potential was unfulfilled, and I left the theater mildly satisfied. Now it is time to countdown to episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I was not expecting some Oscar-worthy, mature-audience-oriented film, but I was expecting something fun that maybe I could see myself watching a few extra times over the years and maybe, just maybe, answered a few of my theories the way I wanted to see them answered. Some say I set my expectations too high, but after seeing The Force Awakens about 10 times and loving every minute of it I expected more than this. As a Star Wars fan, I would give it an even lower rating but I'm trying to be objective here. It wasn't just a bad Star Wars movie, it was a bad movie in general. I see a lot of TLJ haters commenting on bad acting, forced humor, the critters, the fact that they thought TFA was bad...in my mind all of this could have been forgiven with enough good stuff. I loved the critters, they were some of the better moments. What really bothered me were the lack of good lightsaber battles (not a SINGLE clash of blades), the terrible Rose and Holdo characters, the so-called "bold" moments when the director ended storylines without any warning or payoff....I could go on and on. I agree with the majority of the negative reviews here. There just wasn't enough good to make up for the bad. I'm as entitled as anyone else to leave a review. I'm allowed to dislike the movie as much as you might like it. I could write a novel on why this is the worst Star Wars film ever made, but it would be a waste of time. Just glad to hear TFA director is doing Episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Il bravissimo Del Toro usato per un cameo. Tutta la storia è piena di buchi. Un filmaccio orripilante indipendentemente da cosa dica la crtica prezzolata.

Although thrilled to see a SW movie I was disappointed in what it turned out to be.... My enthusiasm had wained. Needless to say that I was not at the premiere of the Last Jedi. There were little to no issues I was looking forward to seeing in this episode. Also I did not feel/have a connection with the main protagonists. Having now seen the Last Jedi I am at a total loss of where this trilogy is going. The storyline was poor and at times totally illogical ... certain subplots were ridiculous and proved to be totally superfluous for the storyline and could have been left out. Episode 8 did not follow thru on the many questions left to be answered from season 7. The the Last Jedi was a lot of unexplained 'hocus pocus' to me and sometimes a 'mumbo jumbo'. I would say this movie is more of a Disney fantasy film than it is a Star wars movie. I still have no connection to the main actors and am not looking forward to episode 9. I have been a fan of Star Wars since it's first release ... I was then 17. Much to my regret I will be stepping of the wagon here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'll keep this short because so much is written elsewhere. This film was extremely well-shot and looked great. Furthermore, practically all of the performances are excellent. However, the plot, inconsistency, total absence of character progression or even any characters, the misplaced humour, the lack of any meaning whatsoever in anything that's happening, the disregard for the entire universe, the previous film, even basic physics, is just astounding. This is the future of Star Wars people, it's a cartoon. It's Transformers, it's Marvel, it's meaningless. This has done it for me now. I'm simply not interested in seeing another Star Wars film. As a fan of nearly 40 years, I think that's about as big a failure as there could have been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Last Jedi simply failed to deliver on all the interesting cliff hangers from The Force Awakens.  Make a list of the most interesting foreshadowing from TFA, the answers don't come in TLJ.   I am a lifelong Star Wars fan and this movie has seriously wounded my Star Wars love.  I feel near heartbroken.  This movie feels like a quality mix of Transformers and Marvel.  It is absolutely not Star Wars.  Where Episodes 1-3 had serious acting issues, the acting is good in episodes 7-8.  It is just the plot.  It is crap and, worst of all, the movie creators failed to deliver on their own plot developments.  The high reviews from critics is confusing.  The social issues touched in this movie are B-grade at best and soooo out of place here.  There is a reason so many people don't like this movie.  If you follow star wars you will be disappointed in this film.  Bet on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I am one of the loathers. One friend, who was not a SW fan liked it, found it visually entertaining without caring who Luke is or remembering any other SW movies. It was the worst Star Wars movie for 3 of us, 2 of us didn't like the most parts but enjoyed some moments. We went to see TLJ, 5 adults and one kid, our ages between 12 to 55. Our little one, 12 years was extramly heartbroken, so upset with Luke's approach to his nephew and found him creepy sneaking on Ben Solo while he is sleeping. Luke's approach was a Sith way, reminded us Palpatine telling Anakin that one apprentice killed his master in his sleep (Palpatine himself), also like Anakin in RoTS, episode III, killing younglings. Luke had anger in him but he was nothing like Anakin/Vader or Palpatine, that's why we loved him, he was all about Love & Hope. Luke sensed the light in his father Vader and challenged him to turn to the light side almost sacrificed himself while doing so. Luke would not think of ending his nephew's life because he has turned dark, especially while he is sleeping, without giving him a Jedi talk.<br/>He has an experience turning Vader to light side, he wouldn't run away and disappear like a coward? Plus, Jedis don't give up! He faced his father when he was young, why would older and wiser Luke would give up on his nephew.<br/>Luke's character was way off, badly written for a cheap twist. Rian Johnson turned Luke a marvel or DC character, hero turned bad, a cliche. The whole TLJ script and story was poorly written. A lot of ideas were from earth, dropping bombs like there is a gravity in space, whole casino scene, weird creatures horse race, frog face temple nuns (Why would there be Jedi Temple caretaker/nuns in space, and also wearing headscarves, LOL), Holdo says Godspeed, just like earthlings, Luke fishing and drinking green milk (ohh how creative, milk is green, radioactive, icky), Rey and Kylo's FaceTime / Skype Chat (Snoke Chat) and etc. Seeing Leia flying like Marry Poppins/Superman was weird, it didn't feel right. Poe talking about General Hux's mother was so low, in fact the whole dialogue between Poe and Hux was dumb and waste. Luke's intergalactic force projection reminded us Han Solo & Finn's dialogue in TFA, "That's not how the Force works".<br/>The Last Jedi was complete let down, it wasn't like watching a Star Wars movie in a space, it was like watching a SW parody movie, The Spaceballs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There is some really out of place humor delivered by characters that shouldn't be delivering it (Poe for example should be the funny 1 liner guy and that's it, nobody else except maybe Luke talking to his sister) and the dialog in general plus the "slapstick" moments are seemingly prequel level quality.<br/><br/>Everything else aside the worst thing this movie does is not answer a single question raised by the last film.  It's no wonder Mark Hamill doesn't like either of the movies and speaks as poorly about them as he can get away with.<br/><br/>This movie fails as a star wars film and a film in general.  Quite honestly this could have been a series of 3 10 min shorts or webisodes that led up to the movie.  It just didn't feel right in any way and as a fan it leaves you feeling empty.<br/><br/>Once the hype dies does 90% of the people who claim to love it will likely rank it as the 2nd worst movie right behind phantom menace...bit at least that had Darth Maul and awesome light saber battles...you really won't get (good light saber fights) here<br/><br/>Even if you are an absolute die hard fan I suggest waiting to rent it...I know that's a hard pill to swallow but it's the truth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not because I would like the weird humor being thrown around, but because how unpredictable this movie was. The visual aspect of the film was flawless, the script felt real. Nowadays, all the people wanna see what they wanna see, and if they don't get, what they wanted storywise, they rant like crazy. I liked how Snoke was killed in a totally non-epic scene, that felt real. **** just doesn't happen the way you expect it to. Neither it happens in slow motion or with dramatic music playing in the background. It just happens. This film was not flawless by any means, mainly the annoying humor has done the main slaughter, but still, it is a pretty good 2,5 hours to spend, because **** actually happens. Not like in those god disgustingly long movies like the LOTR Trilogy and The Hobit, and countless others.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's like you didn't even watch force awakens which I already thought was bad but no let's keep lowering the bar for what we call a "great movie" and then you just try to dismiss fans ratings and just say we are nitpicky and trolling. No you are just a terrible movie producer and you apologize and withdraw this pile of crap. Kill it like Eragon and start over with a writing cast that actually cares about star wars not just wants to make another marvel style money machine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They walked into the theater expecting a rush of nostalgia and instead they learned that their childhood is over and that this is the year 2017. Last Jedi is the first science fiction movie to suprize me in a while and it has succeeded in throwing out every cliched fan theory that the internet has been entertaining over the last two years. I didn't know much about Rian Johnson but I think he is one of the bravest blockbuster filmmakers around. He has breathed new life into a stagnant franchise by writing the first original story in years, creating a completely open playing field for the next instalment. P.S. You may have to watch it twice to fully appreciate the subtext, symbolism and visual brilliance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm not one of those hypersensitive starwars-fanboys, im just a regular guy who wanted to see a cool science fiction adventure...but aaarggh this was terrible. Like, i didnt gave a **** about any of the characters. In some cases (Finn) it wouldve even been better if they had died. Furthermore the characters i actually gave a **** about were totally ruined and didnt even act like themselves.<br/>The entire story of this movie seems to have no point at all, it feels like one of those anime filler episodes where theyre just running down a hallway for 20 minutes.<br/>Even though a friend invited me to see this movie, i felt like Disney owes me 13 bucks.<br/><br/>Oh and by the way, Rian Johnson? Who had the Idea to hire that guy? I looked him up, and it seems like the only notable things this guy directed were two Breaking Bad episodes and "Looper". Looper was really cool, but how can you think that the guy who directed Looper would be good to direct StarWars?<br/><br/>To sum up: Star Wars TLJ is just another ****ty sequel, and is not worth to watch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'd go into every little thing that, as a long-time fan bothered me about the movie, but honestly and without exaggerating it'll take less time to tell you what's actually good about it:<br/><br/>-The special effects are well-done and as a result the battles looked and sounded great.<br/>-Mark Hamill was almost able to make chicken salad out of the chicken sh-t script and was fun to watch.<br/>-Phasma is cool.<br/>-The stuttering thief was a very well-acted character.<br/><br/>I'm not kidding, trolling or joking, that's pretty much it. Look up a screenshot of Carrie Fisher looking old, tired and pissed off from this movie and you'll see pretty much what every face over 20 looked like as I was coming out of the theatre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I usually find the Star Wars movies entertaining. I guess I am a casual fan and I am always excited for new action-adventure movies, which includes SW.<br/><br/>With that said, this movie was trash compared to other Star Wars films. IMO, the worst of all Star Wars movies and aside from special effects, probably one of the worst movies of the year. I know that seems crazy to say because it's freaking Star Wars...but everyone I talk to feels the same way. Disney is trying to force characters that are not needed on people and they are not memorable at all. Just stick with Rey, Finn, and Kylo. Seriously. The flow of the movie is absolutely ridiculous. Even I not being a superfan has no clue how Rey can be so powerful with the Force and have literally like 2 minutes of "training" with Luke. It's absolutely insane. It literally flowed like an off-kilter anime or something. The jokes were cringey and not suitable for Star Wars. Luke was cringey as hell. The casino planet was so shoe-horned in in order to give Rose a backstory, nothing made sense. And why is Finn so amazed and in awe and wanting to play at the casino when they are in a dire situation that needs to be fixed in a couple of hours!? The movie is very "I'm adult do as I say, stop being rambunctious" or something. I understand Disney is over this now but come on...it's so forced! I wish Kylo and Lukes battle was an actual battle. And finding out who Rey's parents are is such a let down. And I'm not even going to get started on Snoke...LMAO seriously, it was like the executives had a meeting and pieced together way too many plot points and boom...there is your 2 hour and 30 minute drawn out movie let's hurry up and film it lol. The best thing that came from this movie is the trailer...the trailer is literally so much better than the movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie has no place in the Saga and will most certainly not be added to my collection. This movie at its core is poorly written! This is a complete insult to Star Wars fans and the mythos. This film opened up major plot holes in every film with disrespectful continuity mistakes. Character development was horrendous. This was a divisive film, an absolute insult to the Star Wars lore. If this movie was a stand alone film it would still be horrible. There is just bad inconsistent writing everywhere. Major plot points are entirely irrational. I no longer care about this new trilogy and could care less what happens in 9. They don’t follow any of the plot points in 7. Absolute garbage, makes the Phantom Menace look like a masterpiece.

Instead of giving answers to questions, they have decided to eliminate what generated the unknowns (Sno ke, etc). And they have left for the last film a single confrontation between Kylo and R E Y, which is of little interest anymore.

Personally I felt they got Luke's character completely wrong (never gave up on Vader who had killed many people, but feels darkness in Kylo and thinks about murdering him before abandoning his family and friends to be a hermit while the first order continues killing people - doesn't work for me). I found new character Rose an unwelcome addition who had no real place in the movie. Her 'mission' with Finn amounted to nothing and only introduced a stuttering DJ who was there to show 'people watch out for themselves'. The whole casino story was boring.<br/><br/>'Cool' characters introduced in TFA, Snoke/Phasma/Knights of Ren are wasted or not mentioned at all and shows there was certainly no thought out plan for this trilogy. It is just being made up as they go along with Rian Johnson throwing away some of the most interesting characters TFA introduced.<br/><br/>Luke's 'show of power' was incredibly lacklustre and a massive letdown and his overall story felt like a disservice to the character. Kylo as the 'big bad' for episode 9 is unconvincing and not intimidating enough and this movie did nothing to improve him. Rey is also too powerful and skilled for someone with no training in the force. The third lesson Luke was to teach was never even mentioned.<br/><br/>The 'run out of fuel' plot line was unexciting, but lead to the only entertaining part of the movie which was Holdomlightspeeding the cruiser into Snoke's ship. It seems a wasted opportunity not to have Leia as the pilot as she'll now she'll have an unceremonious off screen death. It also begs the question why this light speed trick wasn't done before most of the resistance was killed or why this wasn't done in the past to destroy the Death Stars.<br/><br/>Overalll this seemed to throw away the past of Star Wars too quickly, including only just introduced characters and concepts. Star Wars does need to move on from the Skywalker saga, but this was done in a hastily, sloppy way. I believe this would have been a better trilogy had they flashed forward 100 years and started there instead of destroying the past in such a terrible manner.<br/><br/>Yes, the humour seemed forced and wasn't really funny, but that was the least of this film's problems.<br/><br/>I can quite happily throw this film away as Luke does his old light sabre when Rey presents it to him. As someone who has watched all other episodes multiple times, including force awakens, I don't ever want to watch this movie again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

At the end of the film we are no further along the story other than Snoke and Luke are gone, and there are about 20 resistance left that all fit in the Millennium Falcon. All the battle scenes are repeats of previous movies, the main plotline is so confused its ridiculous. The New Order still design their ships with a big flaw that everyone including the resistance knows about, but the New Order don't bother to fix these weaknesses and design defences that can be taken out with a single fighter. The New Order has massively superior ships, technology and weapons but can't catch an inferior resistance slow capital ship because its slightly faster (WTF!) they don't think to deploy faster fighters or bombers to take out the ship or slow it down, or force it to change course, or force it to deploy shields so the rear is unprotected, they just have to wait for it to run out of space petrol. DUMB. It is there as a plot device to force urgency to the story, but the subsequent time-lines and sub plots don't align and the whole thing is a jumbled mess. I could go on and on about the flaws in the film. Its a film designed by committee dumbed right down to reach the maximum audience and sell merchandise and it shows.<br/><br/>Ren is still the same confused emo kid. Rey is still the most Mary Sue of all Mary Sue's, she didn't need Lukes training after all. The new characters are so badly developed and cardboard that I couldn't care less what happens to them, I won't be seeing the next one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie IS STAR WARS. It is not OLD STAR WARS but it still IS STAR WARS.<br/>Lots of people are saying:<br/>- that there are too many storylines to follow. I would not say so. Yes, there are quite a few of them but not that many that you would lose track of story because of it.<br/>- that some parts were unimportant to the main story. That is true, but not everything needs to go according to plan all the time.<br/>- heroes from the original trilogy are not shown as such. That would be really weird (and boring in my opinion) to look at people after 30 years and they would be still same. They are people and people change all the time.<br/><br/>That is my opinion. There is much more but most of it is really the same. If you hate ANY movie just because it is cool to hate it, or you hate it because it is not same like movies that were made 40 years ago, I'm sorry for you. Acting is good. Visually it is good. The story is decent and engaging. It does not follow same rails like FA. And that is a good thing. This movie does not deserve to have scored lower than 5. There are much much worse movies out there.<br/><br/>I said my part.

I have so much heart for the Yoda scene. Holdo light-speed collision: breath-taking. Leia standing in the Crait base doorway: stunning.<br/><br/>On first viewing I thought that, while each joke was genuinely funny, there were overall too many. And I felt that they tied up too many threads, wondering where the story can go in Episode IX. But second time around all these little things fell away and were far more acceptable.<br/><br/>I believe that this film will age very well.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7991043"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">A lot of my reaction to the movie can be summed up as "but then why bother?", and not liking the weak storytelling in general. Interesting that some people online see the hate as a result of "subverted expectations" on Snoke and Rey. Maybe for a subset of Youtube plot-speculators, but it was basically the opposite for me. I was looking to care after TFA failed to sell me on it, but this movie did nothing to correct that. Snoke was and is now cemented as a useless nobody, barely more developed than Darth Maul and far less entertaining. I was dreading Rey's background reveal despite being my favourite new character, and while I hope she really is a "nobody", I can't exactly trust the word of a petty villain on that when he's trying to win Rey over.<br/><br/>The whole setup of the slow-motion fleet chase was underwhelming; neither desperate enough nor tense enough nor eventful enough. The hyperspace jump kamikaze looked very cool and dramatic but seemed cheap and problematic as a plot/worldbuilding point. The hacker mission was overwrought for something that basically comes to nothing, and Rose felt foisted on me without enough development. (There may have been too many characters doing things in this movie.) I was never a big fan of Poe but the way he's so deliberately "taken down a notch" here seemed clumsy and blunt. Finn was fun enough I guess but not that memorable in this movie.<br/><br/>The island stuff was a wash for me. There was some funny stuff: the "Force" leaf-tickle "that's the Force!" was *hilarious*, even if it was slightly too mocking. The porgs are cute and funny, but obvious toy sales fodder. Rey's training was insanely fast, but that's just Rey's thing now I guess. The milk and nuns were a tiny bit odd but sure, it's a little world-building for character, why not. The cave scene teased at something but gave us nothing, not even something disposably dramatic; just felt like a drawn out movie trope, "looking at yourself in the mirror" and all that. Force ghosts can obliterate hillsides with lightning now? Ohhkay... hey I guess there is a huge upside to being light-side Jedi! Yoda's lines felt rushed.<br/><br/>I did kinda like Rey's new thing of rushing to see what the dark side is all about but not actually being tempted by it. Sort of an intense but disciplined curiousity. Luke's betrayal of trust is interesting; it sure makes him look bad, a leader full of fear, but that's not boring. The throne room guard fight was ok non-dramatic action, even if the guards were a bit too "showy" whenever they introduced a new weapon. Leia's float felt a bit animatronic, and I thought it would have been a decent death if she didn't come back. Both "bombing run" sequences (opening, salt planet) felt really dragged out and lacked credibility. I cringed a little when they snuck in a little "Death Star gun".<br/><br/>Luke's final force ghost trick made him feel underused, sort of "oh, I guess that's it then". And all that just to delay the First Order a little bit, while a pathetically small handful of Resistance people are finally rescued after all that? I don't know about this Resistance, they don't seem very effective... better than the Republic government though I guess, what with being totally snuffed out in an instant. I did think it was a little funny how their thinking Luke must have gotten into the base somehow led them to look for an escape, obviously part of the theme introduced by the "blind hope" fleet escape plan.<br/><br/>There was a lot of throwing things away that had been built up, for not much gain. But the movie failed for me on a more basic level, just being kinda poorly written I think, and bloated; just never really pulling me in or giving me any payoff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If the rebels could do such damage with their capital ship why didn't they abandon ship and a do a light speed jump sooner?

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7990995"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I don't normally write film reviews, but wanted to get my thoughts on this movie out there only because I care so much about this franchise. I am not a die hard fan, but I am someone who loves movies and grew up watching the original trilogy as a kid. Over the years it grew to become one of my all-time favorite sagas and I was genuinely excited when Disney announced they bought the franchise and were going to make a new "Skywalker saga" trilogy. I thought the Force Awakens (TFA) was good, but not great. They played it safe, but understandably so from a business perspective. Rogue One was excellent, and I thought, really showed how they could expand the film universe in exciting ways. Together I had high hopes for how they could develop the new trilogy and enrich the new characters while rounding out the Skywalker Sage (as they now call it). However, when I saw this movie not only did they not round out that saga, they essentially killed it. This second movie is almost entirely disjunctive from TFA. Whole thematic elements are abandoned or developed in an entirely about face manner. Having reflected on it, it doesn't even make sense from a story perspective. It honestly feels as though they did it solely to say they took risks or made a "risky" film. I mean virtually nothing was developed ... Rey's apparent force abilities, Snoke's recruitment of Ben Solo, the mystery of Luke's saber calling to Rey .... nothing. Not only that, but new elements like the force tree, the first Jedi temple, ancient Jedi texts, NOTHING. It honestly felt like a 2 year bait and switch. Which is one thing in terms of expectation, but what about story-telling? The result is a complete mess. Rey has unreal force abilities without any Jedi training, while Luke the son of Anakin Skywalker who was created through a virgin birth of force needs weeks of training with a 900 year old Jedi master?! Kylo Ren's arc of struggling with the light was completely obliterated with the result that he is merely bad because he is. No fall from grace, no tragedy, nothing. In addition, what about Luke and Leia. Seriously?! We waited since 1983 for the return of Luke Skywalker, you build it up with him standing on the cliff ... and he throws the saber over his shoulder like a piece of trash?! Setting aside the idiotic place you put him from a character perspective, you really think he would disrespect the saber Ben saved from Anakin all those years, gave to him as his first saber ... even out of respect for Ben and Anakin that seems absurd. I mean, really. Plus, how does a man who abandoned his training with Yoda when he sensed his friends were in trouble on Bespin and refused to lose hope in his father despite his allegiance to the Emperor completely give up his commission from Yoda to "pass on what you have learned" since he would be "the Last Jedi" all because he sensed evil in a 15 year old kid? Really? He would hide out for 30 something years while his sister is pleading for him to come home and allow his best friend to be murdered. Honestly makes absolutely no sense. I could go on and on. Stepping further back plot points make no sense. A 2 hour space chase scene?! Really you had three years to write a sequel and that was your concept? Or Space Leia - how disrespectful to Carrie's memory. Ugh. Honestly, this movie was heartbreaking at almost every level. I have lost faith in Lucasfilm after this. Seriously who authorized this piece of garbage? I truly hope they can right course, but I feel like the damage has been done. I mean, really, if anything required kid gloves it was rounding out "the Skywalker Saga" (again their term) and how they treated characters like Luke and Leia Skywalker ... and they gave us this. It's a bell that cannot be unrung. I am completely cool with going a new direction, but there were dozens of ways to do that while still honoring the prior films. This again felt like going a different direction because they received flak for TFA being too safe. They wanted a bold movie, but bold for its own sake rather than one drive by the characters or story. The result is they ended up damaging the new trilogy and ruining the Skywalker legacy, which instead they have a responsibility to handle carefully. RIP in Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie is filled with beautiful cinematic shots that are satisfying to watch in the theaters.<br/><br/>However, Star Wars 8 failed to tell a complete story. With some scene completely unnecessary, it destroyed the suspense that was built up, such as the Casino scene. The entire plot of Star Wars 8 alone is pretty shallow as they are trying to reveal everything in Star Wars 9, which is the last of the trilogy. However, this not only created a boring Star Wars 8 plot-wise, but will also cause Star Wars 9 to be too rushed to reveal everything. Not to mention that Kylo Ren is the weakest, least threatening villain of all Star Wars movies. Because of this, the movie lack of tension during the fight scene of Kylo Ren. Overall, it is an enjoyable movie, but definitely not as good as critics claimed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It was absolute garbage.<br/><br/>1. Leia in space was jarring.<br/>2. Many times there was emotional tension, and it would immediately cut to something else.<br/>3. How are Finn and Rose going to just escape the chase, do stuff, then make it back without the empire harassing them?<br/>4. The crystal fox was unique and fantastic, but only cheapened with more of them just walking around amongst humans. A single crystal fox acting like the white rabbit alice in wonderland motif would have been sufficient. Having dozens of them was in poor taste.<br/>5. Rey is a mary sue. She got less training that Luke Skywalker, who is also a mary sue.<br/>6. The jedi fight scene looked contrived. It panned forward as the red knights were twirling like ballerinas in a tarantino film. How were the red guards supposed to even see through their visors?<br/>7. Why was there a romantic interest from Rose over Finn only so Finn could throw his arms around Rey again?<br/>8. Why did Rose decide to taze someone when the rebels are a voluntary force?<br/>CGI-but-also-muppet Yoda was just a bad mix. His characterization was nauseating.<br/>9. The coastal alien milking scene was something like it was straight out of Rick and Morty, not Star Wars.<br/>10. The rebels had nothing to celebrate at the end. The pilot character had people kamikaze at the beginning and they were reduced to like 20 people.<br/>11. The beginning scene with the bombs being dropped... how can you drop bombes in space? The explosion of bombs in space isn't going to be effective in the vacuum of space.<br/>12. The thief that helped Finn and Rose mentions weapons sales to both sides, and then it's never brought up again. That was the single most important thing that Rose and Finn found out and they didn't bother to tell the other Rebels when they got back.<br/><br/>It was just a bad movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Unfortunately, it cannot be unseen. This movie is the perfect analogy of Gold wrapped ****  I left the theater confused and almost felt guilty for not liking it. It took me a day to process, weighing the facts, trying to make sense of this experience.  I am an easy going type of guy, I can appreciate the simple things, I don't care if it's from Disney, who's the producer, I sure expected this movie to be on part with the Franchise but trust me it's not. At this point I don't understand the critics, it's all very fishy, to say the least.  Anyways, it's so bad I cannot imagine how on earth they were not aware it would not receive this kind of review from the public. Even Mark Hamil thought so.  So what is the point, is Disney that retarded? Are we?  And what is next?  Can we please have JJ Abram back or Christopher Nolan.  I am going to give this movie 1/10 point for Luke drinking unpasteurized green space cow milk, jeez it was awful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I grew up on the original Star Wars trilogy, which clearly laid out how love, calm, and self sacrifice = the Light side of the Force, and hatred, anger, selfishness = the Dark Side.  It was clear cut, and helped guide my moral compass growing up almost as much as anything. Luke emobodied these ideals and struggled with the darkness and the light through his 3 movie arc before solidifying himself as the greatest hero in the history of movie-dom by saving his father and the galaxy.<br/><br/>And now we have TLJ, where Disney throws everything we hold dear out the window.  Luke is destroyed and treated lower than dirt.  The Force and how it works is destroyed.  The rebellion is destroyed. Everything the rebellion worked for in the original trilogy is destroyed.  The beloved Admiral Ackbar is unceremoniously flushed in favor of a new purple haired character nobody cares about or will remember.<br/><br/>And the main character Rey, who I am supposed to be rooting for, is essentially a Sith in the employ of the Resistance with her rampant use of untamed dark side power. Don't worry though, the porgs and horse-dogs are saved! yay!  Long live Supreme Leader Ren and the victorious First Order!<br/><br/>This film leaves people with ZERO anticipation for episode 9.  Are 30 people (the entirety of the Resistance now fits in the Falcon) going to defeat a galactic Empire of billions? Who will lead the Resistance since we know Leia is dead IRL?  Will they pull some other random pink haired lady from the back or do we need to wait 10 years for broom boy?  Will Kylo finally turn good after slaughtering the entire galaxy or will Rey defeat him?  Who cares.  I'm out.  See you later Disney. I'm going to go hug my pre-special edition VCR tapes of the original trilogy and cry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In this movie, the crucial plot point that the First Order can track ships in hyperspace gets a 30 second, nonsensical expostion dump from a character who was blatantly shoehorned into the script to market to a certain demographic.  Then the arbitrary and lame plot point that the Resistance ships are running out of fuel becomes the central source of tension, despite fuel having never been mentioned as a constraint in any of the SEVEN PRECEDING MOVIES.  At a crucial point, Snoke's ship is destroyed by pointing a ship at it, then engaging hyperdrive to punch a hole through it.  Apparently the Resistance and First Order at the worst tacticians in the galaxy, because their giant fleets could be rendered moot simply by strapping a hyperdrive on an asteroid.<br/><br/>Star Wars movies have worked because of the great planetary settings.  This movie was set in featureless intergalactic space for most of the movie.  The only planets of note before the final 30 minutes of the movie are completely unaffected by the conflict between the First Order and Resistance.  In fact, the one planet that occupies most of the middle of the movie has war profiteers blatantly selling to both sides of the conflict.  In trying to make a lame political point, the writers just made the First Order/Resistance struggle look inconsequential to the larger happenings of the galaxy.<br/><br/>The characters sucked.  John Boyega is basically a placeholder for most of the movie who passively does nothing as events happen around him.  His Asian girl companion was, as mentioned before, obviously shoehorned into the script to appeal to a demographic.  Snoke is killed off without any backstory whatsoever.  Daisy continues to be all powerful without any preceding struggle.  Nuff said regarding Luke Skywalker by Mark Hamill, and kudos to him for having the balls to say it.<br/><br/>I could go on, but really all that needs to be said is this is the last Star Wars movie I'll ever watch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

You can find the full review at my blog (Fluctuating Thoughts on Films)<br/><br/>If you know me in person, you’ll know that I enjoy Star Wars. It’s because of this that I was rather nervous for the upcoming (and since arrived) Star Wars movie. The Force Awakens had left a poor taste in my mouth, and nothing else Disney had done with the property was giving me confidence. That isn’t to say I didn’t want it to be good; I wanted it to be great. In case the past tense didn’t give it away, this wasn’t the case after viewing the movie.<br/><br/>Following the iconic, almost ‘jumpscare’-like introduction and credits, I found myself nervous. I found myself laughing at weak performances from various Extras. This opening action sequence also highlights a primary issue with the movie: There is very little to be invested in. Aside from the late Carrie Fisher’s Leia Organa, and Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron, all characters are strangers.<br/><br/>This time around, I found John Boyega’s portrayal of Finn to be far less grating. The acting was toned down a little, and he became far more bearable. Of the returning characters (besides Carrie Fisher) I found him to be the most improved. That’s unfortunate, as his entire subplot could be deleted from the film. Finn and Rose are on a mission to find somebody capable of disabling Snoke’s (Andy Serkis) ship. In the end, however, they fail. Instead, Admiral Holdo (portrayed by Laura Dern) sacrifices herself while going into hyperspace, aimed directly at the aforementioned ship. Star Wars as a franchise is no stranger to humour, but yet again, they overdid it. It seems as though Disney is imposing a joke-per-minute rule. If it isn’t up to par, it won’t be made. It happened in the MCU, and it’s happening here. I can’t take scenes seriously when the characters themselves don’t seem to, and that really hurts the film in the long run. The writing of this film was, quite honestly, abysmal.<br/><br/>There was many baffling lines from the film, though one of my favourites was “You murderous snake!” howled by a furious Daisy Ridley. I don’t feel her acting has improved from the last film, which is an enormous shame. She continues to overact, shouting almost every line in which she is impassioned.The poor script, coupled with weak performances from actors, made this film feel closer to a fan project than an official movie.<br/><br/>One actor who didn’t seem to falter, much to my relief, was Mark Hamill. Though at times I felt he struggled with the poor script he’d been given, he was relatively consistent throughout. Luke’s character had the most depth portrayed on screen, only rivalled perhaps by Kylo Ren. Adam Driver brought a believable sense of vulnerability to the failed Jedi.<br/><br/>Speaking of Snoke, he was one of the weakest elements of the movie by far. That isn’t to knock Andy Serkis’s work. The voice is fantastic as always, but the character was almost entirely pointless. He gets killed in what feels like the end of the second act. It isn’t a dignified death, either. The film seemed rather confused about it’s rating. There was full on decapitation during a fight in what I assume is a kid's film. I’m certainly not complaining; if anything, i’d like more amputation and the like. It just seemed odd how literally thousands of people died during this film, and we’re never given a moment to dwell on that.<br/><br/>The pacing throughout the film is non-stop. You never get time to appreciate John Williams’ score, or enjoy the cinematography, or anything. There’s always something happening. In a shorter movie, that could be fine. When you have a 155 minute running time, however, you can notice a problem. It might have simply been because I was taking notes, but by the end of the film I was exhausted. Finally, I shall quickly talk about the settings. There’s bland spaceships as expected. Luke’s island has some natives. The Porgs, and some odd maid-like beings. They seemed to live to uphold the temple. Finn and Rose also go to a casino, but it’s terribly boring. Apart from the various aliens, it looked like a building from Earth. Snoke’s ship seemed rather odd. There was a pure red background, causing each character to seem terribly out of place. Whether it was a greenscreen or not, I don’t know, but I am quite sure it was a terrible design choice. Finally, there was the planet of Crait. While, for the most part, it was a barren wasteland, it had a few shining features. One were the rather adorable crystal foxes which actually served a plot purpose, unlike the Porgs. Second, the decision to have the surface of the planet be white salt, with red earth beneath it, led to some fantastic visuals.<br/><br/>To close, I feel the film, though showing potential, fell short of it’s mark. If you liked TFA, I'd check it out. If not, I’d suggest saving your money, or wait until it’s on DVD.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It feels to me like Disney is trying to reignite a flame, a flame that inspired millions of children all over the world and started one of the biggest nerd cultures in existence. For me it's ok to create episodic Startrek movies, because the story lines are often disconnected and have situational meanings. This isn't the case for starwars. Starwars is a saga, a continuation of events that have to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. NONE OF THE EVENTS LINE UP.<br/><br/>1) It is assumed Leia is a Jedi, when is this confirmed in official cannon? did Luke teach her? Did she discover most of this on her own? 0.o Where does this connect or have any meaning to the original movies?<br/>2) Kylo Ren is a completely ridiculous character. He is a comic book villain, designed to please a crowd of 14-18 year olds with emotional issues. Looking for a father figure but never finding it and hoping the world will bask him in sympathy.<br/>3) Snoke is killed off at the half way point. WHY!? He is the most mysterious and story driving character to appear in over a DECADE of starwars, he has powers that match the emperor if not succeed him, yet he's killed instantly by Kylo, yes a man who can basically see into the future, remain force cloaked for long periods of time... IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.<br/>4) When does the Empire develop a moral compass? Last time I checked the majority of it was a CLONE army and always has been a CLONE army yet they're now recruiting for the massed populas of millions of worlds? To have them leak secret plans, turn on the empire... Christ.... I dunno<br/><br/>This movie has no direction, no purpose, it simply wipes the floor clean so Disney can create it's own cannon separate from the Lucas cannon. Kylo Ren is right when he says, "Let the past die" too right.<br/><br/>Disney have killed Starwars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7970862"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This latest cinematic installment, and I say installment rather than addition as addition would suggest consideration of and positive effect upon all or any of the preceding material, to one of the most beloved stories in the world has, with all its promotion, anticipation and critics reception, achieved the incredible feat of creating something of an "emperors new clothes syndrome" across the world.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson, the tailor of this empty garb, has some how been able to convince Disney and those we trusted to parade and praise the work he has done, whilst the public and many of the eager fans clap happily along and cheer for what an amazing spectacle he has created. Then there are those like myself, akin to the little boy staring at the emperors flaccid member in confusion and shock, whom raise their hands and point out the fact that the entire experience is an embarrassment.<br/><br/>Regardless of poor writing, story structure, bad and misplaced humor, sloppy editing, terrible plot devices, blatant marketing and money making "creative" decisions, zero character development and shoddy or hammed up acting by many, I am not sure why those at Disney responsible for the Star Wars property would chose to stray so much from the core material for these chapters in the saga. At their heart these stories are about the legacy of the Skywalker's, even the original title of episode 4 was "Adventures of Luke Starkiller, As Taken From the Journal of the Whills, Saga 1: The Star Wars". So, in my opinion, The last Jedi and then chapter 10 should have at least concluded that arc properly. With the choice for Luke in this movie and the path of Ben Solo, the legacy of the Skywalker lineage seems to have been cast aside in order the start crafting the next chapter for a new generation. The expansion of the Star Wars universe is something everyone wants, be it the fans or those with financial interests, and the creation of material to introduce people to new characters and worlds is wonderful, but not at the expense of the previous material and hard work done by thousands of people over decades.<br/><br/>With the originals, George Lucas aimed to create something ground-breaking and exciting. He used his knowledge of previous cinema storytelling and strong narrative to fashion a new way to tell the same type of story. He wanted to use the latest techniques to craft something fresh but recounted the same kind of messaging his inspiration told or he himself believed. Even in the prequels, be it you love or hate them, were efforts in the same vein yet, unlike Johnson, George Lucas managed to maintain the heart of the universe he created whilst telling the story he wanted.<br/><br/>What Disney and Johnson have done with the Last Jedi is disappointing, with no respect towards the original material or consideration towards the correct tonality for the genre let alone Star Wars itself, something that for all peoples gripes with TFA, the entire team got right and were respectful of. With TLJ they have seemingly tried to make Star Wars more relevant by changing the tone of the film, through choices of language, acting, character prioritization and constantly hammering the message that the old is to be brushed away and only the now, new and future is worth considering. Such a message might sound like a rallying call towards progress and one which may resonate with the ever increasingly impatient youth of each generation, but is one that also has the frighteningly narrow minded connotation that the past should be forgotten, that the old and more experienced are best not considered, that the mistakes previous generations made are better left behind because they were after all mistakes. Yet in doing so Johnson's message forgets the fact that with experience comes learning's that would die as result. The scene with Yoda in the film momentarily suggests that Johnson may begin to craft a worthwhile message but unfortunately he chooses to be "unexpected" and we are not provided with this important lesson as we see Yoda burn the books he considers useless. We see many of these types of lessons clumsily delivered in the film which many chose to defend as brave and bold choices or justify as holding deeper meaning, yet for all the arguing it can not be denied that they are inherently non Star Wars in both content and delivery.<br/><br/>All in all, there is a great deal more to say on the Last Jedi, be it superficially or in digging deeper and searching for answers, comparisons, metaphors, connotations or messages, but my experience with this film is that it is the only Star Wars film I have not enjoyed watching and that was from the very first scene of poor humor between Poe and Hux, right through Luke's space walrus molestation, past the ill conceived side quest & beyond the character assassination of a childhood cinematic hero. I will not be interested in seeing the final chapter of the Skywalker arc and will take solace in the words of Mark Hamill...its just a movie</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They know (as i've read in some fans negative reviews) that people will go and $ee it again "Just to be sure it was as bad as I thought the first time". They know there are enough dedicated individuals who will find substance in a film where there really is none. They know people will still go and pay to see it, even you reading this now who is baffled at how The Last Jedi could have been made with such a garbage script.<br/><br/>I am truly amazed how fans justify the films shortcomings. I am in awe really and find their interpretations fascinating, though I'm mostly disappointed and sad they they have to stretch their opinions to make sense of this poorly written script. I'm disappointed because it shows that people don't care much about story or logic and can easily fool themselves in to thinking things that don't make sense, do. And that is really what it is. Disney has tapped in to that inherent human flaw of hoping for the best, and giving the benefit of the doubt for beloved stories in order to make money. That, if anything, is what should be admired about this whole sloppy mess. They've adopted the Star Wars religion, and be sure they know what they've got here, and will keep on producing awful stories in this genre because people will pay money and go see it regardless.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, my interest in the Star Wars universe is done and dead. I won't be fooled in to paying to see any more Disney Star Wars, other negative reviewers here should pledge the same. There are better things out there and we still have the original (unedited or even the adywan edit) trilogy in our home collection which they can't make any money from. May the original trilogy Force be with us. 1 star for the special effects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke is made into a cowardly character, that has given up on the Jedi. The First Order (New Empire) is suddenly in control of the entire galaxy at the start of the movie (no explanation of this is given. The Resistance (Rebel Republic) is suddenly on the verge of losing every soldier in their army at the start of the movie. Their army is down to a couple hundred people (this is never explained either). The entire movie revolves around a low speed chase between the fleeing rebels, and the pursuing imperials. This entire movie long chase sequence is full of plot holes, but more importantly it is boring. Without explanation in this movie a certain long running star wars character suddenly has full blown force powers. Dumb prequel level goofy aliens keep showing up ala Jar Jar Binks throughout the film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
