Offering up challenging developments at every turn that mostly develop the decades-long franchise in a creative and fresh direction. And, though some of the decisions may be a bit more difficult to swallow than others, the sentiment to mix things up after 40 years of lore is definitely admirable. It also helps that the set pieces and lightsaber battles are all on point, and the fact that the characters and performances are all in line is also a plus. It's just the audacity and difference of it all that's gonna' a take while for me to get used to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It honestly made me sad to see the legacy of Luke Skywalker get ruined in such a casual manner.  It focuses so much on being different from expectations that the plot suffers in the process.  I came out of The Force Awakens with several questions that I was excited to see answered in episode 8.  I had no questions at the end of this movie and I felt no excitement about seeing episode 9.   I will admit that it was beautifully shot in several scenes, but that is the only thing I enjoyed about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I can't get over these sites trying to blame the fans for not liking this movie. I love the Star Wars franchise and actually somewhat enjoyed The Force Awakens (even though it was a clone of A New Hope) and Rogue One as well. Now lets take a look at The Last Jedi which somehow every critic seems to be overjoyed by. The humor at times was fun but many times was overused and out of place. Now let's look at the goofy and once again overused CGI (just like the prequels) through out the film. The  Leia force float scene was awful, the running PT-ST was terrible, the characters riding on the back of "Clifford the Big Yellow Dog" looked like something that belonged in a children's cartoon, and the x-wing U-turn with space skidmarks (wasn't that in SPACEBALLS?), common guys. Wasn't it J.J. that said we were trying to get back to the way the old movies were done.  I can't believe the critics didn't even mention the pacing. It's all over the place. I'm not even gonna complain about Luke. It's a sad way to portray the character and it's not what the fans wanted (even Hamill himself didn't seem to comfortable over these decisions). You don't give fans what they want and they will hate your movie. I'm pretty sure that's a universal reaction for any fan of any series. It's not just Star Wars fanboys that react that way. I personally didn't hate the way Luke was handled but I understand the reaction. Another thing, all these sites that have noticed the terrible fan rating on rotten tomatoes have not seemed to want to point out all the terrible user reviews on IMDB. It has also been hammered on here as well . The fans do not like this movie and cannot understand how the critics actually do. In fact many fans think you folks are getting paid not only to give the reviews your giving it, but also this,"fans are villains", damage control **** your pulling is just plain wrong. People grew up loving these movies, being mostly disappointed by the prequels, finding faith again in Force Awakens and Rogue One, and then ... being handed this poorly constructed movie. There are good moments in this movie!!! Don't get me wrong. It's not a complete disaster but honestly it's not great either. I loved the ship destroying the Empire Ships by using light speed. I liked the standoff between Kylo and Luke. Luke dusting off the shoulder was fitting and subtle enough to fit the style of humor these movies are known for. Overall though when I left the theater I felt very 50/50 over this movie and 50/50 does not sit well alongside the excellence of Star Wars. Even a puppet yoda ghost can't raise this  film above a solid 50 or 5 out of 10 rating. Benicio Del Toro's  forced stutter, a BB-8 Empire edition version robot (because why not?),  cartoonish CGI (especially in the casino scenes),  Rey's parents, no Snoke backstory, and this ridiculous, now love triangle (what are we trying for here,TWILIGHT ?). Yes I know Luke ,Han, and Leia seemed like it could have been going that route in the originals but we don't need that overused idea. This movie is FLAWED. The fact the critics are so oblivious to this really leaves fans to wonder if the media is being honest here and now that your blaming the fan base, oh you guys are making yourselves look like your collecting a check from Mickey Mouse himself. Look everyone is entitled to their opinion but when multiple sites are banning together to start making fans out to be bad guys over a  poor movie, there is something wrong here. Either that or are current generation of critics just don't get it. As for the people giving this movie 10s or 0s you are all TROLLS of the worst kind. Neither of these scores are fair for this movie or almost anything that is media related. A 0 or a 10 should be reserved for the worst of the worst and the best of the best and shouldn't be handed out like candy on halloween. No wonder no one wants to take fans serious when we review things. Disney, Johnson, and Critics, this movie is bad. Deal with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7920059"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I never thought there would be a Star Wars movie that would make me want to walk out of the theater. I never thought there would be a Star Wars movie that I never wanted to watch again. I never thought one Star Wars movie could taint the entire series, possibly beyond repair - but somehow they managed to do all those things.<br/><br/>I have watched the original trilogy easily 50 times. I grew up in awe at the universe that George Lucas created, in awe of the amazing way Star Wars balanced incredible creativity and imagination with down to earth, amazing characters. The balance of being very futuristic, but almost in a way so nuanced and relatable that it seemed like it could actually be real.<br/><br/>Enter The Last Jedi - completely took all relatability and threw it out the window. This movie completely started rewriting the Star Wars universe. The Force is apparently much different than the other 8 movies showed us. Characters apparently use 10 times the amount of sarcasm and humor that they did in the other 8 movies. The physics of space are different than the other 8 movies.<br/><br/>Not to mention, the many totally and utterly pointless scenes that did nothing for the story or the character - What was the point of Rey going into that dark hole and seeing 1,000 of herself in the mirror?! Why was the code breaker in a jail cell if he could just let himself out?<br/><br/>I physically cringed/rolled my eyes multiple times during the movie. They took the beauty, the depth, the amazingness of the Star Wars saga and made it a cheap, made-for-merchandise, gimmicky superhero movie a la Transformers or Avengers. It screamed "WE MADE THIS SO WE CAN MAKE LOTS OF MONEY" not "WE MADE THIS BECAUSE WE FREAKING LOVE STAR WARS". I cannot believe this movie is supposed to sit next to the original trilogy on the shelf.<br/><br/>There were so many moments I thought there might, just might, be a redeemable storyline and every time it was a let down. Poe going rogue to save the day - nope, just kidding. Finn giving his life to save everything - nope, replaced by the cheesiest line I've ever heard from Rose, a totally disposable character who seemed thrown in for the diversity requirement. Imagine if Laura Dern's AWFUL character (I was hoping she would die the entire movie) was replaced by Admiral Ackbar giving himself up for the resistance!! It would have been so much better and a character anybody remotely cared about. Luke following Obi-Wan's example and giving himself up - nope, he was Force appearing somewhere (which no Jedi master has ever been able to do before) and died anyways.....WHAT?!!?!<br/><br/>Not to mention, the agendas and cheesy messages that were so obviously pushed throughout the film - "You can do anything you want, no matter where you come from" "It's not about fighting against what you hate, its about fighting for what you love" Save the animals. Be a vegetarian. I could keep going. There is nothing wrong with these messages, its just that they were forced into a STAR WARS MOVIE! Go put that in your low-budget animated **** for kids, Disney. It was an assault on the audience's intelligence, like the director didn't realize people would pick up on how obviously he was forcing messages through. So many terrible lines as well, like the characters were giving us all a play by play. (Finn saying, "Man, they hate that ship" or Poe "Oh, so you mean we're going to slip down to the surface and wait for the First Order to pass") Thank you for forever ruining this series, idiots. Thank you for literally destroying a piece of my childhood. I just can't believe this movie was released. I might need freaking therapy to get over it (ok, a little over the top). Our only hope is that JJ Abrams that somehow pull this train back onto the tracks. But its a long journey back to the tracks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Beautifully shot with some genuinely great work from everyone not named Benecio Del Toro (the stutter is so, so unnecessary, man). It's about making your own future/way in the world without following the playbook set forth by your parents and everyone that came before you. Just like Kylo Ren, the movie is a bit like an angsty teen: brash, unpredictable, impulsive, and sometimes a little confused. Above all, it's something Star Wars hasn't been since Empire: risky. The movie isn't perfect and won't survive the scrutiny of the Reddit crowd, but that's fine. Viewers would do well to take Luke's advice: Breathe. Just breathe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I don't like hype to get the best of me but I have to admit i got fidgety when the Star Wars intro kicked in. I could tell the movie was different from the start but wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and let a few weird or **** attempts at humor slip past. As the movie progressed I got more and more irritated with it. Once i realized this was how the movie was really intended to be I couldn't help but feel extremely disappointed. This movie was a slap in the face to the fans and like Mark Hamill said, hollywood will sacrifice quality for money. Looks like Disney will make a killing off of stupid **** Furby looking owl aliens dolls, which got more screen time than Chewbacca... Spoiler Alert!

The weakest "evil master" in Star Wars history. All the negative press Star Wars fans were worried about after Disney took over, came true in this movie. I left SO sad and disappointed...Horrible story. Horrible new characters. Big plot holes. Worst ending of all time.

Every major character question or plot advancement comes down to this: "it doesn't matter. your heroes don't matter. Jedi's don't matter. Those intruiguing backstories you want to learn more about? They don't matter."<br/><br/>We get it: This is a NEW Star Wars, intent on installing fresh faces. But why all the plot holes and needless trouncing of iconic characters? General Akbar gets killed while the purple haired kindergarten teacher is immediately immortalized? Luke sees his old lightsaber, the lightsaber that Obi Wan gave to his father during his training... then was passed onto Luke during his growth as a Jedi... Yeah, that lightsaber? Toss it out. It's dumb. Doesn't matter.<br/><br/>At no point does Rey receive any instruction, training or coaching in the ways of the force. She's simply bestowed them and rises about Luke Skywalker himself in power...<br/><br/>Why did they go to the casino city again? To make a point about weapons dealer ethics and animal rights? Wait...what? (When they did get thrown in prison, a master codebreaker happened to be chilling there, with a key to escape. He must have been waiting there because... oh... that's right... IT DOESN'T MATTER.<br/><br/>The cinematography: Gorgeous.<br/>The locations (other than a needless casino subplot): Fantastic<br/>The writing: Very, very lazy and subpar.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It has so poor story telling, . the first half and hour is spent on useless plots around technical ship stuff. The tone pacing is awful, lacks charm, characters are not developed, the jokes are stupid. Relationship between Rey and Luke is underwhelming. They just massacre Luke´s character, couldn't relate him to the first trilogy. Introduced their social agenda that even if agree with it has no place in the movie. I could go on writing how of a  disappointment this movie is for most star wars fans. The only thing i can give this movie is that it has some amazing visual moments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I had this same issue with "The Force Awakens", it just wasn't memorable. None of the characters stuck with me. Also, the plot of this film just seems hokey and poorly thought out. I won't post specifics, but you will find yourself laughing or rolling your eyes in several parts.

While the reason for this isn't related to bad cgi or annoying characters there are still plenty of moments that lead to this film's downfall. The side stories, pacing and run time all lead to a horrid abomination of a film that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth of the viewer.<br/><br/>Most of the plot of the movie can be summarized in a few sentences. This is why the plot mostly revolves around side stories to pat the run time and add depth to the story. However Episode VIII creates these side stories in the worst way possible. Multiple sub plots in the movie lead to barely any actual effect in the story. Compared to previous films in the series where side plots are introduced these sub stories while intercepting never lead anywhere.<br/><br/>The second gripe I have with the movie is it's pacing and flow. When creating a story the plot needs to follow the basic formula. Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action and Conclusion. The flow of this movie feels more along the lines of Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, Climax, Falling Action, Climax, Conclusion. Overall The plot feels very misguided and leads into the worst part of the movie; the length.<br/><br/>Star Wars Episode VIII has the longest running time out of any Star Wars. At first this isn't so bad I mean hey long doesn't always mean bad just like how short doesn't mean rushed. But The Last Jedi is not long for the right reasons. The show feels like it's trying to fit in much more than it needs. It feels like the director is in a game where he has to give his work to another writer after 10 minutes. Eventually he has 1 minute left and scrambles to fit all of his remaining ideas left even though the story could have wrapped up 3 minutes ago. Overall the movie is very rushed and leaves you feeling like you just want it to end.<br/><br/>Now while all I've done so far is bash Episode VIII the movie is still fun; sometimes. The few fight scenes are entertaining. The jokes while mostly falling short are sometimes funny. And a few cgi creatures actually look appealing to the eye. The movie isn't the worst of 2017. By no means it's not even a bad movie it's just OK. Now don't get me wrong it's not one of those inoffensive movies that doesn't add or take away anything; far from it. Star Wars Episode VIII is extremely offensive at times but the action and plot changes spliced throughout the story keep it from dawning the rank of bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But since others Star Wars movies are full of Locomia, pod racing, boring stars shots, ewoks and other things that make them not really that pleasuring to watch, this one is not the total garbage most people are saying it is.<br/>But the action scenes are so good that I really think that it kind of saves this movie. With one less hour of meaningless arcs, this would be excellent. Definitely a movie wich I will rewatch when I can skip the boring parts in the bluray.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Remember these critics don't want to bite the hand that feeds them. Man did this movie suck. Goofy, vanilla kind of stuff concentrated at appealing to the mainstream audience to generate revenue from toy and merchandise sales. This trilogy is nothing like the original trilogy. Luke skywalker was very disappointing,he was a negative moaning winger the whole film. I'm all for race and gender diversity but this film has way over done it. A white hero, a black hero, an Asian hero, a male hero, a female hero but never two of each because that would upset big time company's who pay to advertise during star wars adds. They make more money appealing to the mainstream. That is exactly what this movie is. A mainstream revenue raiser with no originality that is carried by the SW name. Disgusting.<br/><br/>The actors they casted in this movie look way to square and geeky to be real heros on film. Rey, the new jedi, looks like a person who just graduated from a university with a degree in accounting. Finn, the ex stormtrooper, looks like someone in real life who would never take any risk or do anything exiting. The new little Asian girl they casted, man she looks so square and geeky its not funny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Even if you didn't love it (and it was great imo). This movie is not a 0-1 score!! There can be a middle ground!

A Rey uma excelente personagem se torna uma retardada mental, e tem sinestesia sobre a psicopatia de Kylo Ren, simplesmente Han Solo morreu em vão. Se fosse pra fazer um filme assim era melhor ter cagado no EP7, logo ninguém teria expectativa no EP8, agora pegar todo um público antigo e enganar, fazendo o EP 7 dizer que Star Wars voltou, e depois chegar no 8 e ser essa decadencia, PQP, não sinto nem um pingo de vontade de assistir novamente.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

To make Rey jealous and turn her in to the dark side in IX? Because of Finn? And then turn Ben to the light side? With the assistance of Ghostly Luke? The purplish woman that light speed the ships like it was a bullet (that epic ending would have been perfect for Leia/Akbar) and then some more, paraphrasing a friend of mine:<br/>The thing went like this: (in the mind of the director/scriptwriters): let’s explain who the knights of Ren are... Nah, no one cares... Let’s explain who Snoke is... Nah, who cares? Let’s kill him the stupidest way possible! , Rey parents, lets reveal who they are, Nah, they are piece of **** drunks that sold her... OK! Let’s show Luke as the great master Jedi he is... Nah, he’s an old piece of **** coward that in all the movie does not clash a damn light saber against anybody, because, the fans did no wait decades to see that, no, one that projects himself far away and then dies from exhaustion??? WTF, Let’s give an epic ending to Leia, in memory of C.F. Nah, make her flight and develop super powers from the thin air (well in space there is no air so, from thin nothingness) and make her fly like superman just because…, let’s make Chewie throw away perfectly fine food, to what end? It was already cooked! I mean, it’s a message you want to give anyone? Don’t eat animals? Chewie, go vegan!, then in the middle of the movie, let’s make a remembrance to the cantina-ish, but let’s give it a casino royale vibe and throw a high grade actor in the mix that will give a speech about how bad wars are… what a disgraceful way to treat Benicio del Toro… and let’s not forget: the comic relief, I can’t be sure, but I don’t know if there more than 3-4 on the old movies, there’s one every 3-5 minutes in this one, WHY? It’s not a comedy… I could go on and on, I did not like at all what they did with the movie and I dread where is heading, I used to love star wars, I still do, but not this Disney crap we are getting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Sure episode 7 was predictable and bland, and Rouge One had a slow first half, but both were decent, and enjoyable. Episode 8 is awful, as a lifelong star-wars fan, it's like a punch to the gut, I'm not someone with any particular agenda here, it's just a straight up horrible movie. The casting is bad, the new characters are bad, the acting is not great, the script is utter garbage and the pacing/editing doesn't help things. I wanted to like this movie, I expected to like it, but man, was it just awful. I don't think I can consider myself a star wars fan anymore, the director is an absolute dult I was concerned after hearing him moderate a panel on Blade Runner 2049 where he acted like a nervous 12 year old, but I would have never suspected he would produce a disgrace of this caliber. Disney is truly the evil empire, they have sucked out everything that made star wars special and meaningful and replaced it with cheap, stupid, pointless comic book movie style drivel. Not only is this a bad movie, its my least favorite film I've ever seen, because it is a death blow to my favorite fictional universe of all time. I cannot fathom why the critics are giving this good reviews, its episode 5 but worse in every possible way and completely pointless. Without spoiling anything, 2 characters are completely wasted with stupid deaths that leave tons unresolved, and a new character, I will spoil this, Rose, is so awful and force in it's in full cringe territory. There is no art in this movie, star wars has been reduced to an annual toy-spewing blob of low-grade action movies. An absolute travesty that truly deserves a 0/10 rating.<br/><br/>Additionally I am convinced that there is a large group of mouth breathing zealots that will defend anything with the star wars label on it regardless of how much it sucks. The fact that this film is getting positive reviews makes me even more determined to distance myself from this brand and pop-culture in general, this is just bad, bad movie, from a bad director and a horrible studio.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's main strenghts are having some really good performances (Adam Driver & Mark Hamill) and a nice OST but it's very weak in every other department and only superior to Phantom Menace in acting and special effects. Some people that like the movie and cannot accept a different opinion rely on the very poor argument of fans not embracing a fresh take on the SW universe and hating change. First of all, that's false when we think of beloved works like KOTOR or the smashing success of TFA & Rogue One. But even if you disregard questionable writing like Luke's backstory with Kylo Ren, Leia's use of the force and other qualms about continuity, the story is still a mess. The pacing is off and scenes seem padded out, the humor is often weak and doesn't land and ultimately very little of what happens feels earned:<br/>*Snoke can do a skype call video chat between Kylo & Rey and perceive every bit of the former's inner struggles yet he fails to notice his murderous intent and a freaking lightsaber moving next to him. His death is also anticlimatic and nullifies any chance of ever seeing how The First Order came to be and what his connection to the Sith was, making the whole background of the conflict very sketchy.<br/>*The praetorian red guards that are supposed to protect Snoke and hilariously adopt fighting stances at the drop of a coin fail to realize what's going on and do their work the ONE time that very thing is required from them.<br/>*Finn's story ultimately does nothing for the overall plot and even what it does for HIM was already established in TFA. Rose's romance with him feels contrived and underdeveloped. This is the one point that even positive and negative reviews agree upon and it's a considerable chunk of the movie.<br/>*Poe's arc is all over the place and unnecessary. Vice Admiral Holdo is a character that is written and performed in a very ambiguous manner just for the sake of a later plot-twist. *Rey and  Kylo Ren's relationship over the course of the movie makes little sense considering what she already knows about him (having witnessed Han Solo's demise) and is only possible because of contrivances with the force and a flashback that does its best in writing Luke as an ****. Some of it even feels like it came right out of a Young Adult movie adaptation but with better actors.<br/>*Benicio del Toro's DJ is protagonist of some of the most implausible sequences and outcomes.<br/>*Anything I could say about Phasma would require more effort than what the writers actually did with her.<br/><br/>As stated in the beginning of this review, the movie not only barely works as a standalone but it also knowingly decides not to further develop many threads The Force Awakens started, making the previous chapter almost skippable (one example being the main plot of Luke going into exile but leaving a map to his location...but granted, that is a flaw that TLJ carries over from TFA). I could go on but at the end of the day anyone that loved the movie will fail to acknowledge most of its flaws as a big deal and those that thought it was horrible are already speaking their minds. Overall a HUGE disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If you view the original trilogy as a sacred text which must be revered, cherished, taken seriously, and adhered to faithfully I can't imagine you will like this movie and I highly recommend ending your Star Wars experience with Return of the Jedi.<br/><br/>For me however the force was both mystical and mysterious. The galaxy was wacky and fantastical. And this movie goes between both fun and intense. Ultimately I think that's the spirit of the original movies even if it decides to push forward beyond exactly the scope dictated by those movies. See this movie if you want a fun Star Wars adventure that decides to continue to develop both the protagonist and the galaxy of the originals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7918520"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I'll admit, I'm a Star Wars fan. Not an ultra-mega-fanboy fan--just a regular, mortal fan who maybe read some EU when I was a kid.<br/>So when I walked into The Force Awakens, I tried to be pragmatic about it. Of course I wanted to be floored a la Empire Strikes Back, but I was prepared to be simply entertained like I was by Rogue One or, to a lesser extent, The Force Awakens. Sadly, at the end of TLJ, I walked out really disappointed. While I absolutely agree that the movie delivered great special effects and exciting moments, I found much of the plot to be forced and hollow. Some of my complaints are problems with modern action movies in general. For instance, the original SW movies spent enough time in each setting to establish some sense of place. Example: when Luke trained with Yoda, it actually felt like he had been training for long enough to gain some knowledge. In these new movies, one or two lessons and boom: Jedi Knight. Then it’s off, breathlessly, to the next contrived problem.<br/>Other issues, however, are specific to this movie: character overload, corny jokes, unnecessary plotlines, a stupid premise, Laura Dern’s character (why?). Where critics gush over “Nonstop Action!!!!” I was thinking “This movie is just throwing stuff at us because it doesn’t know what else to do.” It like, when the writers outlined the story, they were just like “and then, this! And then, this! And then, this! And then, this!” and so on, ad nauseum. It felt more like Marvel or Fast and Furious than Star Wars.<br/>And that’s what really bothers me--the series feels lost from a story perspective. The Empire had this great, rich history as the benevolent Republic turned fascist. The First Order, in comparison is just thin. It seems like something writers came up with to deliver “Star Wars” action. "There has to be a bad guy, so let’s just write one in. Oh and we’ll need stormtroopers."<br/>Star Wars is supposed to go somewhere. Trust me, I’m no fan of the Prequils, but in comparison, at least they knew where they were going. The issues with the Prequils were mostly technical—bad acting, bad directing, bad scripts—whereas the issues with this new series are both technical and fundamental. Is it the worst Star Wars movie? In absolute terms, not even close. It’s still more watchable and enjoyable than any of the Prequils. To be fair, I loved Adam Driver’s character and I thought the Snoke plot twist was brilliant. But in exchange, Star Wars has sold its soul. Disney is churning out Star Wars-flavored cotton candy. It’s all sugar, no substance. And given that these movies are the last opportunity to use much of the original trio in a meaningful way, that’s really sad.<br/>Finally, I’ll focus on the real world for a moment: I don’t understand why this movie has gotten such good reviews from critics. Maybe Disney’s scare tactics really have moved the needle on intimidating publications out of writing bad reviews. In any event, with all the praise and the giant box office opening, there’s no reason that this same formula won’t be used again and again in the many future movies currently planned.<br/>The Evil Disney Empire won. Lucasfilm has turned to the Dark Side. There’s nothing for Star Wars fans to do but flee to exile while their galaxy is twisted and plundered—and hope that someday, the light will return.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's time to admit that Star Wars died when George Lucas gave up control.  Disney will just be content to repurpose, reimagine and remake every single Star Wars moment that came before.  Eventually Episode 15 will roll around and it will be a remake of this one, with an 80 year old Mark Hamill reprising his role.  That being said, I didn't hate this film.  It feels like it was made with a sense of craft that was sorely missing in Episode 7 and I liked the greater roles that Luke Skywaker and Leia were given.  As for some of the points that people re bringing up, I never cared to know who Snoke was, or who Rey's parents were.  It all stopped making since 2 movies ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

TLJ, just idk what it is, but it just didn't sit right with me. I'm hoping Ep. 9, can pull it all together, but really TLJ felt like an ending not a middle, so its over all tone, continuity, etc, just felt off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Irrespective of the lack of plot (only ne actual meaningful thing happened which is that Kylo killed the forever enigmatic Snoke), the movie does not respect the intrigue that was set up in the film that preceded it.  Force Awakens was by no means a perfect film but respected the source material and captured the essence of Star wars.  This clunker arrogantly dismisses all of the interesting questions raised by that movie including: who is Rey?  Who is Snoke?  How did Maz Kanata acquire the lightsaber?  Who are the Knights of Ren? etc.  Luke was made into a helpless joke in this one.  For God's sakes they spent an entire movie in Force Awakens trying to find Luke and he refuses to help the "good guys" in any meaningul way.. Decoy?  Gimme a break.  How many decoys were in this movie lol.  At least the "space horses" were set free.  Heads should roll over this, starting with Rian Johnson.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The film's treatment of legacy characters comes off as disrespectful to long time fans and yet also fails to deliver any compelling character development for the new cast outside of the main antagonist. Established plot points and mystery set up in J.J. Abram's The Force Awakens are squandered for the sake of shock value and the film compromises the integrity of its characters to hold together it's flimsy plot. In The Last Jedi's few moments of brilliance, it is on par with what audiences have seen in the Original Trilogy. In between those few moments of greatness, The Last Jedi struggles to gain a leg up over any of the films in the Prequel Trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7885331"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">First of all, everyone's grade is subjective. But what people who throw perfect scores at this movie need to understand, is that this amount of negative feedback is not just a matter of hate. The movie gets a lot of criticism, because it deserves a lot of criticism. If FOR YOU this is the best Star Wars movie and you love it, you have nothing to feel bad for, you are not wrong for loving it. You are wrong however, if you claim the criticism the movie receives is completely wrong. Now, to actually go into some details.<br/><br/>I do not hate this movie, but this is the first Star Wars movie I came out of from the cinema thinking: I did not like this movie. Even Episodes 1 and 2, when I came out of the cinema, I had a smile on my face. True, upon further reflection, they are not exactly the best movies, but this movie, first time view and I was not pumped, I was not smiling. I was just... I did not like this movie. I think they made some bad decisions. And I think Mark Hamill agrees too.<br/><br/>FROM THIS POINT ON SPOILERS APPLY<br/><br/>I think the movie starts off well, with an awesome space battle, and a pretty deep moment with Leia and Poe where she wants him to be a leader, but he's not there yet. For me the problems start when Leia enters a coma or whatever that is, and Admiral Holdo takes over. Admiral Holdo is a character that did not need to be in the film. I wholeheartedly believe that if they just kept Leia conscious for the entire film, and had that Holdo - Poe conflict actually be a big opinion difference between Leia and Poe, where Leia wants to grow him in the next big leader, her successor and actually treats him like a son (u know, the son she lost to the Dark Side), that would have been a much more rewarding evolution. I am sorry, the scene where Holdo sacrifices herself, looked amazing. But I felt nothing. If that would have been Leia, I would have been crying.<br/><br/>Next up is the big stinker for this movie. The "Run - get code breaker - come back to destroyer - stop tracking" plot, that is followed up by Finn and Rose. That thing is just stupid. But that is not even the biggest problem. Even with this convoluted mess of a plot, why did they need to make it such a boring, long, drag? That takes up 1/3 of the film, and it is absolutely dragged out and terrible. It touches on 3 very nice and smart themes: animal cruelty is bad, war makes good business and arms dealers sell to rebels as well, aaand the whole impressing the kids secures you tomorrow's Jedi. The themes are nice, but unfortunately most it is just those horses running through the track, through a field, through a building, through a street, through another building, through some corn. And then... oh here is a neat smart scene on how this arms dealer deals TIEs to the 1st Order and Xwings to the Resistance. 20 seconds of smart vs 6 minutes of BS CGI horse chase that does not add anything to the movie.<br/><br/>Last major point I did not like about this movie is what they did with Luke. First of all, I did not want to see Luke die this episode. Even if his death is actually becoming one with the Force willingly, I don't think this was the best thing to do. And if they really wanted to do it, I think the way they did it not doing the character justice. In A New Hope, Obi Wan goes out in a similar way... but not really. In Ep. 4, Obi Wan is not actually in a situation he can easily get himself out of. So he knows what he needs to do to go out like a boss. Luke does not do that. If they really wanted to kill Skywalker, they should have actually brought him there. They should have made him wreck some AT ATs, give Luke's fans a scene of him being a total bad-ass, have him fight Kylo and then have the scene where he sais... if you strike me down I will be with you forever. And then, the mind game with Kylo REALLY begins. Have Luke put a huge display of power only to LET Kylo "win", and "kill him" just so he can prove a point.<br/><br/>This movie, is a huge waste of potential. But the 3 points I mentioned above, are not a question of missed potential, there are plenty of those in the movie, but not these 3. They are a question of poor decisions, and ultimately why I did not like this Star Wars movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Also, Rey's dark cave scene.<br/><br/>Now the bad, which completely overwhelmed the good scenes, starting from least important:<br/><br/>First, terrible humor right out of the gate (felt like a mediocre snl skit) - set a bad tone from the start. Second, the major reveals of how Kylo turned dark, and Rey's parentage, were completely underwhelming and contrived.  Finally, the entire way of handling Luke was a travesty and I've only gotten more upset about it the more I've thought about it the past few days.  Starting from his throwing away the lightsaber, to the weird (and again terrible humor) of the milking scene.  And on to the rushed and contrived Kylo Ren turning bad story, and finally to the stupid hologram fight scene.  And if all of those things weren't bad enough, they decide to go for the grand finale by killing Luke off in the least satisfying way possible. The only emotion I felt was anger towards Rian Johnson.  The Luke in that movie was not the real Luke by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson wanted to be edgy by killing the past, but he killed off Star Wars completely.  What I watched wasn't Star Wars, it was a mediocre film in some other galaxy. It's almost as if 'The Last Jedi' is a prequel to Johnson's upcoming non-skywalker trilogy.<br/><br/>I tolerated the Force Awakens because at least it felt like a Star Wars movie, but now I think this entire trilogy was a huge mistake.  It's going to take a miraculous episode IX to save this mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As the second entry of the trilogy, having a fairly good starting point from TFA, I don't understand why the galaxy situation was not explained. It just seems like a lazy writing work, when Star Wars is all about the galaxy as a whole, about politics, different groups and aliens.<br/><br/>Which reminds me, the majority of the caracters were human. Why in a Star Wars movie?? I think it should never be a Star Wars episode. Maybe as a standalone, detailing one of the countless battle scenes between a Rebel/Resistance group against the Empire/First Order, with different characters(!), it could have been a good idea. But as one of the main episodes? Forcing the characters to change only to fit a plot written by a seemingly newcomer into the Star Wars world?? Come on...<br/><br/>I believe that in order to make Star Wars movies, some strong and maybe completely different approaches to filmmaking must be adopted.<br/><br/>For example: to have a (or a team of) writer(s) respecting the lore as much as possible. There should never be a person in charge of the franchise who doesn't respect the established rules;<br/>Assign the same producing/writing/directing people behind a complete trilogy. Only then can we have consistency. The work from JJ Abrams in TFA was completely destroyed in TLJ..<br/><br/>I give it 1 for the amazing sound and visual effects. The acting is also quite competent, even convincing. To bad it doesn't make up for the direction of the movie.<br/><br/>It seems to me we have a waisted trilogy.<br/><br/>Just hope this doesn't ruin the franchise..<br/><br/>Cheers!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Leia debió morir en el espacio y por la "fuerza" regresa del vacio del espacio a la nave y se convierte en la única sobreviviente de los altos mandos, ya que también muere el almirante Acbark, Luke muere de la forma mas extraña y sin sentido que eh visto, Phamas es un personaje extrañamente parecido a Boba Fett, es decir, es una inútil, que habla poco y tiene aspecto mas de Bounty hunter que de Stor trooper y también muere, Snoke es un CGI que también muere por Kylo Ren, el cual lo mata en 5 segundos y le ofrece a Rey se una a el para conquistar la galaxia (algo así como el ofrecimiento de Vader a Luke), Rey lo rechaza y Kylo toma el control del Firt order y orden matar a todos y a todo, sin dejar nada vivo. Por lo que me da la impresión de que Disney desea matar a todos los personajes clásicos para meter nuevos, seguramente por la edad de los actores. Considero que no es la forma de matar a los personajes, pudieron hacerlo mejor, toda la película tiene momentos de humor innecesarios, se deja en claro que los Skywalker ya no importan porque llega una nueva camada de héroes para venderte nuevas figuras de acción. Si crees que Episodio I era mala, esta le arrebata ese lugar.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7916102"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">TLJ: The most illogical plot i have seen in a while, void of any nuance and epic feel that characterizes STAR WARS. Ok, its hard for me to write this review. Its really hard for me to dislike a STAR WARS movie, i am somewhat positively biased against STAR WARS. The first time i saw the movie at the premiere i was stunned, and shocked on how poorly written and how ridiculous the plot is. In my second viewing i noticed much more writing and creative decisions that dont´t make any sense, story-wise, character-wise, logic-wise, STARWARS universe-wise. Lets start with the good things.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: The technical aspects of the movie are really great, the cinematography and the visual effects are incredible. This movie plays with the color palette and its balance, to a beautiful degree. Also the score its amazing, JOHN WILLIAMS is awesome, and it shows. The way sound mixing and editing blends with the score is ear-dropping. THE BAD: ALMOST everything else. The story is beyond LOGIC for me. Its like if MILLENNIALS teens were behind ALL the story decisions in this movie. Its incredible the amount of forcing a viewer has to do to make SOME sense out of the illogical storyline.<br/><br/>Right in the start they show you the tone of the movie that will be along the 2.5 hr feature. Its unfathomable , for me at least, that a FIRST ORDER "GENERAL" will not engage fire on a ENEMY fighter in attack mode, possessing the highest and most skilled pilot of the RESISTANCE. I mean in FA they did blow up planets with millions of innocent people just to decimate the resistance, and in here you hesitate to BLOW UP the highest and most skilled pilot of the resistance. no, no just no. Then, right after that, why in the world (or galaxy) would they not put any SHIELD to the MOST ADVANCED AND DEADLY attack ship in their arsenal, it just doesn't make any sense. Other aspect, is how they characterized LUKE SKYWALKER. I don´t mind him being and old and scared, and cowardly against everything he stood up for, JUST GIVE ME A LOGICAL EXPLANATION for this. Right off the start, he throws his DAD´s lightsaber to a cliff, WHAT?? Does this play in the same universe emotionally and logically??? It was his DAD´s lightsaber, the one he heroically saved from the EVIL SIDE and died in his arms. Wouldn't he at least show some interest on the memento of his father´s main piece of history. Why throw it for a laugh? its really cheap and bad writing, PRACTICALLY ANYTHING would have been better. WHY in the world would REY be capable of beating LUKE with the force and throw him to the floor. I mean she of course force grabs the lightsaber, and then LUKE force grabs an antenna?? WTF. It just doesn't make any sense. LUKE character is really miles off of what he should represent, and there is no logical explanation behind it. The poor explanation is that he failed his nephew student because he sensed "some" weird darkness in his sleep and hesitated to kill him. WHAT? Its just lazy and poor writing all around, it has no emotional resonance or anything. Before, he saved his EVIL DAD against the odds and faced the most evil person in the galaxy just to vindicate his FATHER, he was willing to sacrifice himself and face death just to see his dad becomes who he once was. Here, he tried to KILL his nephew because he sense some darkness in his dreams? ( i mean everyone from time to time, dreams about darkness). There is no in between, if you sense darkness in somebody, you open dialog with them, talk to his parents, but no, the only explanation in TLJ is to avoid talking any sense into the other person, and TRY to kill him. Its just very messy storytelling.<br/><br/>The space chase is also very thin and ridiculous, time will give people the opportunity to really question RIAN JOHNSON logic behind this. Its just shows the cartoonish incompetence in the first order, its almost like a parody on how to do everything wrong if you want to eliminate your enemy, the problem is that is not funny. They really do not want to kill their enemies, they just wanted to let them go. There are INFINITE ways the FIRST ORDER vessels could have managed this situation better. There were are at least 3-4 ships, added to that of SNOKE´S planet sized ship. and why in the heck, do not they simply allow a single STAR DESTROYER to warp speed ahead of the resistance convo, and attack from different sides. I dont have a problem with REY being from nowhere, in fact, i think is BRILLIANT, it would have been one of the greatest story parts of the new starwars saga, if it wasn't handled so POORLY here. Anyway this movie is an incoherent mess, where logic goes to die, and story telling is thin and without emotion. I am really torn on how this movie turned out to be. There are many other things i didn't like, there are some things i did like. But its appalling how ultimately bad it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is not Star Wars, it's Disney Star Wars, and Disney has been pretty arrogant from the beginning of their acquisition of Star Wars...rushing through The Force Awakens and Rogue One and promising not 3 films over 6 years (something we SW fans are used to) but ONE FILM A YEAR.  Starting - as soon as Disney's machine is capable of...who cares if the story makes much sense?  They chucked out all of the "EU" that fans had contributed to (and George Lucas tolerated) and said "We've got our own direction" - the direction being a complete repeat and rehash of every story element and character arc from the original trilogy.<br/><br/>A young desert orphan wanting to learn the force from a reclusive old master on a quirky lonely planet, the Rebel on the run from the Empire after destroying their super weapon, a personal connection between the man bad guy in a mask and our lead, a side trip to a wealthy planet where a new character betrays our heroes, a showdown on an ice (sorry, SALT) planet with AT-ATs and trench warfare...we've SEEN THIS ALL BEFORE.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the film is full of terrible blockbuster cliches and no earned emotional moments.  Within the first 5 minutes it jumps from a prank phone call that belongs more in Guardians of the Galaxy or Spaceballs, to suddenly a dramatic sacrificial death scene of a character we've never met...then picks up cliff hanger of the last film, where we are quickly disappointed to find out that Luke, the hero of the first trilogy, is a grumpy old man and not much else.  Why exactly?  Well, in Disney Star Wars, that's privileged information.  You'll only get it in tiny flashbacks or extended universe merchandizing the company creates to fill in the plot gaps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not just now, after TLJ's release, but since the release of TFA. If the only means of driving the story forward is to denigrate and humiliate the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of the original trio then your story is trash and not worth telling. The characters are not worthy of their predecessors. Disney, Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson have done irreparable damage to the saga. It's because of this that the above four will never receive any of my money ever again. You humiliated my childhood hero, Luke Skywalker, and I will never forgive you for it. The Star Wars saga ended at the completion of Return of the Jedi. Our three heroes lived happily ever after and the shadow of the Disney juggernaut is but a bad dream.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7915724"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This movie is not just the worst Star Wars movie ever created, if you can even call it that, it is also simply not a good movie. It has a completely pointless side plot that doesn't fit neither in style or tone to the rest and just drags the movie out way too long. The pacing is awful, the dialogue rivals Attack of the Clones levels and the humor is atrocious. Not that the humor isn't funny.. it is for the most part. But it is used in the completely places, almost every time taking all gravitas and emotion out of a scene. And on top of that it is the kind of Marvel humor that often even breaks the 4th wall that just does not belong in a Star Wars movie. But as mentioned, even in a normal fun movie it ruins a scene and emotion every time in this one.<br/>The characters have almost no progression or arc except maybe Kylo Ren. The others either don't progress at all, are suddenly completely different from what we saw in TFA or even regress and undo a lot of their development we saw in TFA.<br/>Someone at Disney obviously didn't like a single thing about TFA because Ryan Johnson got a green light to basically destroy everything TFA achieves, from character establishment to entire plot points. Half the support cast is completely discarded. The way Luke Skywalker is portrayed is absolutely appalling. For a casual movie goer at least the performance of Mark Hamill is very nice, even though even his at times great performance hits rocks on the road whenever he's forced to deliver an absolutely stupid one liner or milk alien **** apparently Disney's way to bring nipples into a Star Wars movie..  otherwise his performance is very good, maybe the best of the movie. But at no time does he actually come across as Luke Skywalker. Maybe at the very end in one scene.. but even that scene has the problem that he comes across as Empire's Luke.. not as a Master.. even Return of the Jedi's Luke was more progressed as a character, so he's yet another example of this movie's tendency to undo character arcs.<br/>The movie is basically resetting the galaxy to the state of Empire Strikes back without achieving any of the drama or emotion of that original era. The claim this movie did anything fresh is also completely without basis. This movie copies scenes from Empire and RotJ left and right. but unlike TFA which copied a lot from A new hope, this movie fails to get the tone and gravitas of any of these scenes right. TFA only failed with the new "death star" scenes. The rest worked. This movie can't get anything right. The Jedi training doesn't work, the "joing me, we'll rule the galaxy together" doesn't work. Rey running off to redeem Kylo is an entire movie too early and makes no sense for her at this time in her development. She literally called Kylo a monster after she watched him kill Han just two days or so ago. The hoth scene is the most insulting. The hoth-copycat maneuver is so obvious that they actually havea  soldier lick the ground and make sure the viewer knows the ground is white from salt and not snow... apparently thinking this made the obvious copy and better... and here again the movie fails to even remotely capture the drama of the battle of hoth. Nothing is achieved in this battle. We attack, we get blown up, we retreat without having achieved a thing except for an awkward kiss out of nowhere that just makes you go "ewww" because it is THAT unbelievable.<br/>And finally this movie also throws in useless and damaging SJW propaganda that is so painfully obvious it hurts. Diverse cast on the rebel side, white males on the first order side. female leaders on the rebel side, male leaders on the evil side. All men, both good and evil, are cowards, idiots or insubordinate machos, the women are all cool headed and holier than though, better at everything without any stablished reason how they got their skills. Add to that out of nowhere comments about the military industrial complex, capitalism, animal rights and veganism and you got the mix. But this movie is even too stupid to pull this off, by making the black lead the biggest idiot, a coward and repeatedly mentioning that he was a janitor that wiped the floors. But only a couple scenes later he suddenly pilots a speeder when in the last movie he needed a pilot because he couldn't fly a ship... and why is an engineer or whatever Jar Jar Rose was supposed to be fly one of those as well...<br/>which brings us to the next problem of this movie. way too many people are good at everything for no reason while the first order is shown as incompetent clowns.<br/><br/>I could say a ton more about the failings of this movie but let me finish with almost the biggest shocker that I only realized after a while... even John Williams lets you down in this. The score is copy and paste from TFA and OT and not a single new memorable theme gets added to the mix. And not just familiar short themes: An entire OT track is hijacked and played in an action scene.<br/><br/>In short: This movie is awful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

You see character development of the two leads all stuff critics love.<br/>However when Mark Hamil complained about the script - Disney executives rave about the brave new choices and direction of the script with unusual decisions for the Star Wars films. You can spot why fans of the universe are not happy. In the post-truth era, this means they must be Russian bots, I would have thought it should be trekkers if anyone but hey why ruins the Disney narrative especially as Cineplexes and Critics need to bow to the Disney/Pixar/Marvel machine or miss out. This says everything you need to know - this is not episode eight but the marketing department of Disney making the choices and decisions for the universe. As a standalone film - it is just okay, Star Wars has always had the love of fans and forgiveness of the fans for the absurdness of the scripts and ropey dialog - for every Jar Jar Blinks there is a Darth Maul. The universe is about hard work, self-sacrifice (Jedi) and good versus evil (Sith, who take the easy route). This film just throws that out and humanises the leads making them conflicted and unsure of themselves.<br/>Without this trade-off of good versus evil, hard work vs easy route, all the absurdities and many pointless subplots, undeveloped characters obviously just inserted for their merchandising potential, the film just jars. Lots of new characters, lots of artsy shots, lots of humour (but not Thor quality) but nothing cool. Ships which require large crews to man and pilot - are suddenly performing massive manoeuvres which they previously were unable to complete with just one person standing in the middle of the bridge. The entire might of the first order is brought to bear on a single base - with a blast door. So this might of six plus destroyers is reduced to less than a dozen walkers and a single blast cannon. Even for Star Wars this is the least believable with the most glaring plot holes and absurdity - people who were not Force users in the seven previous films suddenly have the ability to fly through space, blow blast proof doors aside and no longer need to be able to breathe. The force is no longer a fabric of the universe and just a virus that randomly selects people and makes them so powerful that they no longer need to train or develop or learn. You just destroy all previous knowledge and millennia of knowledge - hard work is not needed anymore. The force is now fit for the snowflake generation. Some ships are going so slow that they are almost going backwards and the first order can't shoot a cruiser because it is too fast but said cruiser can't even inch any further away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I liked the character development of some characters like Luke, Kylo, Rey, and Poe. The movie improved in some areas, such as a more original story line, a very engaging space battle, and some cool new landscapes (and seeing more of the island was pretty neat). I did however have my tropes with this movie. Some scenes were just straight up stupid, that being luke milking that weird walrus cow... thing. I get that he's a hunter and a survivor now but that was just a little bit gross. It doesn't even compare to Leia's **** force scene. What? I'm supposed to believe Leia was thrown into the vacuum of space from a missile attack that decimated her room and she was just floating there like "durr but the force"?? Using the force is one thing but I'm pretty sure the force can't stop your eyes and brain from exploding from being exposed to the vacuum of space. Another problems I had with the movie was the pacing. We constantly get thrown back and forth in between this casino, but getting thrown back into the space battle. Or the scenes on the island with luke... but then getting thrown back into the space battle, which doesn't advance at all! Constantly resetting the tension can really take you out of the moment. I was practically begging for the space battle to end because of how much of a drag it was. Another major problem I had was the forced marketing. The porgs were so forced and so obviously a toy to sell for the movie. We get it, they're cute and fluffy and chewie is eating them, but they don't interact with the characters other than to show up on the screen and be cute. Take BB-8 for an example, he was a marketing ploy done right. He interacts with the plot, he interacts with the characters and he has personality.<br/><br/>The final problem I will talk about is probably my biggest problem with the movie... CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! So we finally get to see Snoke, the high and mighty, wise but manipulative Snoke. And we get nothing out of him. Sure we get to see him in person, and in his badass red throne but we get no progression with him because he dies half way through the movie. Which inherently is not a bad thing but we may as well had seen him through the hologram the entire movie and we would have got the same result.<br/><br/>Princess Leia also might as well had been killed off during the space battle scene (No disrespect to Carrie Fisher by any means). Leia did literally nothing after the coma scene. Just thought I'd ramble for a while. I did actually like this movie overall but it could have been a million times better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It feels like it was written by someone who doesn't actually like Star Wars, for people who don't like Star Wars. It's the same criticism I have of Star Trek Discovery -- it's not Star Trek, it's a new show pretending to be Star Trek for people who don't actually like Star Trek. For one thing, TLJ is a complete tonal mess. It's afraid to take itself seriously, and so it throws in inane jokes at inappropriate times. It also undoes practically everything that the previous movie set up. After finding Luke Skywalker, [it becomes apparent that he didn't want to be found, so who created the map that was the driving plot point of the first movie?](#spoiler) Snoke was set up as a badass villain, capable of incredible feats of force manipulation, who seemingly comes from nowhere. Okay, I can get on board with there being another dark side user on the level of Sidious being out there in the galaxy, so long as it's explained. But [they kill him off unceremoniously, and we're just left hanging.](#spoiler) I mean, Sidious was strong enough to fight Yoda -- a legendary Jedi master -- to a draw, which I would have thought was a big deal. Having some other guy on his level should also be a big **** deal, but it's never actually explained. Rey's parents? Again, just glossed over as a big **** you to the audience. Keep in mind, I actually like the fact that [she's not a Skywalker](#spoiler), but it bothers me that she has more raw power than just about anybody we've seen, which I'll get to in a sec.<br/><br/>Luke Skywalker's character was completely butchered by the writers, to the point where I doubt that they've ever watched a Star Wars movie. Rey is a completely overpowered Mary Sue whose powers feel unearned, because even Luke Skywalker -- the son of Force Jesus himself -- had to struggle and lose before finally becoming strong enough to face his father. Rey is somehow strong enough to perform incredible feats with the force, despite zero training, because apparently she's just that good. Then there's the new general who goes out like a hero, but again it feels completely unearned because she's a nobody. And don't even get me started on the scene where Leia -- another force sensitive with zero training -- [manages to fly herself back into a spaceship like Magneto](#spoiler). **** that **** And of course, there's Benicio Del Toro's character, who made me want to post elephant dung to the director.<br/><br/>There's just so much wrong here, I can't see myself going to see the third one. It's not Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The entire second act of the movie only happens as a result of using the "idiot plot" trope.  The plot is not driven by characters motivations, instead bizarre scenarios are concocted solely to get characters to act in certain ways.<br/><br/>In the Context of the previous 7 movies this film makes even less sense.  No context is given to explain how the characters we are supposed to relate to got themselves or the republic into this situation  Episdoes I-VI are made irrelevant in the opening crawl  "The FIRST ORDER reigns. Having decimated the peaceful Republic, Supreme Leader Snoke now deploys his merciless legions to seize military control of the galaxy."  Episode VII turns out to be a giant Red Herring.  Who is Snoke?  Why did Lukes light saber reach out to Rey?  Why did we hear Obi-Wans voice in Rey's force Dream?  The entire plot of TFA revolved around a Map to Luke.  Why did this map exist?  Why did R2-D2 have half the map?  Why did R2-D2 wake from his coma when Rey showed up?  Apparently none of that mattered.<br/><br/>I understand making an attempt to subvert the audiences expectations but this movie just seemed to go out of its way to trash everything leading up to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Actors are unappealing and the movie lacks true relationships between characters, no romance, very little good quality humor. Kylo Ren is a JOKE. Everything CGI lacks effort. Destroys the essence of the Star Wars spirit.  Rogue One was a quality movie. Why can't Disney recognize the quality in Rogue One over the last two episodes of Star Wars? I guess its all about the money now. Its unfortunate that the younger generation will believe Star Wars is about low budget comedy and open to any characters regardless of whether they bring power to the series. BAD-BAD-BAD.  Shame on Disney and Greed.  They must have bought out Rotten Tomatoes and other major reviews. The real opinion is shown in the overwhelming negative comments.  Only the first 3 original Star Wars that George Lucas created will remain legendary. However, Rogue One has my respect.

TLJ is a film with so much promise but falls flat like Snokes corpse and the underused character development. There's a reason the audience score is the lowest of any Star Wars film. And like many, I hated almost every major plot decision in it.<br/><br/>TLJ is a beautifully shot, well directed, well acted, terribly written mess-of-a-film bristling with oddly placed Marvel-esque meta-quips, bizarre shifts in narrative tone, dull side-plots filled with Harry Potter-esque CGI creatures/fauna that are completely inconsequentia; that ultimately offers no logical character development and impacts the story in no way at all. You can say what you will about the prequels falling victim to cheesey dialogue and casting missteps but, and I HATE myself for even thinking this, they pale in comparison to the 2.5 hours of boring, disposable ‘busy-work’ the majority of these characters are given. Johnson clearly only has an interest in exploring Rey and Kylo’s characters as everyone else is basically going in circles and under-developed. On top of this the most insulting thing I felt as a viewer is that TLJ systematically deconstructs and undoes all that was set up before which has led some to exclaim how TLJ ‘bravely makes choices and gives you something you weren’t anticipating'… but actually it insults you for even caring about anything Abrams and Kasdan set up in TFA by not answering anything at all.  TLJ is a film that blasts away the mystery and awe left by its predecessor, and shows its loyal, theory-obsessed audience that nothing is going to be linked to what they thought in ways akin to how the writers of LOST treated their viewers. Instead of leaving you with wonder about how this trilogy will continue, you’ll be left wondering what you’re meant to be wondering about with the future of the films.<br/><br/>Let me explain, if you want to kill off Snoke then do it, but don't make it a cheap death. Snoke hasn’t been developed enough to understand why it is meaningful, or not meaningful, when he dies to Kylo Ren; let alone me. If Rey is a child of nobodies, then make it meaningful why her lack of knowledge of her parents is in itself meaningful and important. Show us, or at least tell us, but don’t cop out completely with nothing to fill the cop out. Iif you’re going to 'completely flip the genre on its head' then don’t fill the film with constant ‘is he dead’, ‘no he isn’t’… ‘oh but now he is’ misdirection and psyche-outs. Even Finn, on his redundant side-mission, looked like he was going to die 3 separate times. One by execution, but then he doesn’t, then Phasma may have killed him, but then he returns, and then he tries to sacrifice himself by taking out the final super-weapon, but then he doesn’t… this rollercoaster was both taxing and infuriating; especially when this ‘fake-out/psyche' happens repeatedly to Luke, Rey, Finn, Leia and even Rose! Add on the rip-off chase plot from Battlestar Galactica and repeat the same scenario of Rebels need to take on a super-weapon 3 separate times (a dreadnought, a ship with tracking abilities, and a Death Star mini super-weapon and failing each time) and you’re left feeling really drained. Most of all this is a film, that disrespects Luke Skywalker character, one of my all time film idols, someone we saw briefly in TFA but I/we ultimately haven’t seen on screen for 35 years, by insufficiently explaining why he is the way he is and completely mischaracterising what we do see of him. For example, Luke refused to fight Darth Vader because he felt the conflict and good within him… yet he senses a conflict in his own nephew and for ‘reasons the script needs to happen’ Luke decides to murder him IN HIS SLEEP? Sure this sets up Kylo’s path and explains Luke’s guilt, but what led him to this point?!? What happened to Luke? Now he is just a grumpy, cowardly old man? The hero is gone???? What? Why? He doesn’t want to be found, but he leaves the galaxy a mysterious map so people can find him? What? Why?<br/><br/>Never ONCE in a trilogy that was had the opportunity to resolve the story arcs of our favorite heros did we even get Han, Leia, Luke, and Chewy in the same room! Now the actors who are alive have dead characters, and the character left alive belongs to a dead actress! All I can say is, JJ, I would like to think this was not your intended storyline from the beginning. I would like to think that Rian Johnson attempted to blindside our expectations but in doing so he simply betrayed the potential growth the new characters. Seeing as each writer and director seems to have a blank slate as they start each film, with the freedom to take things in any direction they want, combined with the similar amount of outrage this film is getting from divided fans, I can see Episode IX spending most of its runtime undoing everything TLJ deconstructs!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There were lots of interesting moments and it was gorgeously shot. And until the last 10 minutes of the movie I was mostly on board. But having Luke die in such an uninspiring way really killed it for me. Essentially, what we are left with is the complete negation of the original three movies. The heroes save the day in RotJ. That buys them a few years of quasi peace. Luke messes up Ben Solo's training, and as a result goes into exile for the rest of his life (note that he never gave up on Vader even though Vader was objectively worse). Then, finally, when Luke reconnects with the world, he dies due to...what? Overexertion? We have no idea. So what Rian did to possibly my favorite character ever is why this movie gets a 2 from me. The plot was honestly not great even without the Luke-centric objections, but like I said I could've gotten by with that if Luke lived or died in a blaze of glory or something coherent. Oh well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I loved The Force Awakens, I relished in its retreading of A New Hope and fell in love with the new characters, the new score, and all the questions that JJ Abrams left unanswered.  But as the sequel grew ever closer, I slowly came to terms with how unsatisfying the answers would inevitably be.  I couldn't imagine a way that it wouldn't feel contrived; but alas, my fears were unfounded.  The Last Jedi navigates those waters with the utmost skill, finding the best possible course through those narrative mines, taking unexpected turns and delivering on the emotional promise of this new series.  To those who have yet to see this movie, understand that those turns might not be for you.  If you want the original series to be retold, then this is not the trilogy you are looking for.  But if you want something new, yet something wholeheartedly Star Wars - then strap in.  Go in cautious, it's always better to go in with lowered expectations, but don't let those decrying this film steal your hope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Just right off the bat, there's a ping pong match happening on screen. Seriously, if someone asked you to recount the scenes one by one you couldn't do it, no one could.<br/><br/>I don't know, there were some cool parts but everything I cared to find out about LITERALLY was not addressed. I just think these two sequels have been placed in the wrong hands. The visceral "feels" just don't seem to be there.<br/><br/>+ I still like Rey and Finn<br/>+ Solid cinematography<br/>+ Luke Skywalker was fine<br/>+ Blue apparition Yoda looked good<br/>+ Digital Snoke's parts made sense (almost mocking what happened in episode 7)<br/>+ It didn't plagiarize like episode 7 did to 4.<br/><br/><br/>- The ancient texts, the "tree", the dark hole, Snoke's background and rise to power, all thrown in the fire and never explained or touched upon. Some kind of lore please, anything!<br/>- Not on team Poe, I don't get why he's such a major part, and he was a huge in this film<br/>- Princess Leia, sorry but cocaine is a hell of a drug. And let's not even mention the "gravity" scene<br/>- Still too much digital ****<br/>- The entire casino world was like a straight to disney channel digital **** show. STAR WARS IS KNOWN FOR PRACTICAL EFFECTS what is that ****?<br/><br/><br/>The one scene I raised my eyebrows at was General Hux while standing behind Kylo after the "blood bath". Did he go to reach for a lightsaber? Is he the real sith lord?

It's amazing how many are saying (in Comic book nerd voice) "worst Star Wars movie ever"...really??? Expectations are always astronomical with a film like this and while I don't think it captured what TFA did, it does have a roller coaster of emotions and keeps you on the edge for most of the film. Star Wars has always been filled with one liners and humor in tense situations. People are acting like this is some new aspect that has tainted the series. Get a grip and come back to enjoying movies like you did when you were a child. It is seriously like no one is pleased with anything anymore and feel they could do it better and can't wait to feel validated with even more negativity on sites like these. Oh, and go see it because it's the most fun you will have at the theaters this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

However, it is pure entertaining joy - sweeping, grand stakes space adventurism. The movie runs a bit long, and not everything works very well, but most is strong enough to carry the day. The dynamics between Rey and Ren are worth the price of admission alone (especially when it includes space battles). This movie is polarizing; it throws away old conventions and plays fast and loose with treasured characters. I wonder what the real user score would be if you eliminated all the reviews that gave it a "0" because it plays to "SJWs" (i.e. it had a lot of strong female characters and leaders, gasp!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
