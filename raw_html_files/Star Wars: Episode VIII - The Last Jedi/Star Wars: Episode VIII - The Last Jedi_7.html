It’s so perplexing that I dare say it almost feels conspiratorial. I’ll sum it all up like this. Sitting here right now, I would rather watch any of the prequels again, any of them, before I sat through this film for a second viewing. The prequels, despite the painful slapstick humor and boring dialogue, at least felt like Star Wars. This film was barely recognizable as a Star Wars installment, took zero risks, and will be the first Star Wars film released in my lifetime that I will not see more than once in theaters. And no, making a jumbled, disjointed, unrecognizable mess that stupidly kills off important characters is not “taking risks”. It’s bad filmmaking. Almost nothing of consequence is addressed in this film. None of this makes me happy to say, I wish badly that it wasn’t true, but alas, it is. At least for me, and for other fans as well as I see the negative reviews pour in.<br/><br/><br/>I really wish Lucas was still in control. The man created Jar Jar Binks and forced us to sit through his painful dialogue and potty humor and I’m still saying that after watching Episode 8. There were moments in this film that were so patently absurd I would have laughed out loud if I hadn’t been too stunned to respond. Instead, I sat there in quiet disbelief. Some of the stuff that happened not only looked ridiculous but was completely unnecessary to move the story forward.You are left wondering "What in the ever living hell was that?" Certain decisions made for characters were so radically out of place it left the viewer with no chance of being invested in the remaining story. This was not brave or surprising. It rang as fundamentally untrue and felt like shock and awe simply for the sake of it. And the totally overboard self-deprecating humor was just too much. This is fine situationally, but when you poke too much fun at The Force and the Jedi, it’s hard to take them seriously when you need to rely on them to drive the story. Star Wars humor has always been about the tension between characters or whimsical bits for the kids. It never poked fun at its near-sacred foundations of the Force and the conflict between the Jedi and the Sith. These are serious topics for the characters, the fans and the saga as a whole. Lucas always treated them as such.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I’ve never felt so indifferent to Star Wars in my life after watching The Last Jedi. I think a big part of that is because I’m not confident at all in Disney's ability to do this thing right going forward. Additionally, even with JJ Abrams’ best effort, I currently see no way that he can salvage the mess that Rian Johnson created. It’s just too damaging. It’s almost as if Rian Johnson disagreed with Abrams’ direction for Episode 7 and sought to make a point by slashing away everything set in motion in The Force Awakens. I wish Episode 8 could be redone entirely. I now have no interest in Episode 9 whatsoever. I cannot believe I just wrote that! But I must admit it is true. This felt like a Disney cash grab, a rip off cloaked in Star Wars garb. Disney thought all they needed were space battles, lightsabers, and furry creatures and we would eat it all up. Anyone who appreciates decent filmmaking or has any love for the Star Wars saga is at risk of being terrifyingly disappointed.This is NOT Star Wars. Disney FIX THIS NOW.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8106093"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Grand, sprawling, chilling, complex and painfully misunderstood, The Last Jedi is perhaps the most unnecessarily despised family film ever made. I've never before seen such a shocking amount of intensely over-the-top and often extremely childish rage against a movie assembled by an array of very talented, passionate and caring people whose intentions were completely good-hearted. And yet despite this, The Last Jedi has recieved an astonishingly colossal amount of black-hearted hatred from people who clearly have absolutely no grip on reality when discussing this movie and no real argument beyond "It was different to what I expected, so it's bad!". The entitled fanboy tantrums are so incredibly embarrassing.<br/><br/>Now, allow me to defeat four of the biggest accusations made against this movie:<br/><br/>1. "Rey is a feminist Mary Sue!"<br/><br/>That couldn't be farther from the truth. Rey is - and I'm 100% serious in saying this - not only one of the best Star Wars characters, but one of the best film characters ever. Sure, she may strangely excel at a few specific things, but the sheer mystery of who she is and how she managed to acquire such a strong connection with the Force is so beautifully told. And inside, she's lost, broken and needs help, and when she fails, it breaks her even more. If she were a Mary Sue she would have succeeded at convincing Luke to help her from the beginning and would have defeated Snoke without Ben's help. She would do everything without any effort, but instead in this movie and The Force Awakens she DOES put in the effort even when things are tough, and that makes me root for and love her. And as for her parents being no-one special? That's a GOOD thing because it proves that not every heroic character needs to be connected to another character. It makes Rey and her future status as a legendary heroine unique. This movie does such an wonderful job of showing her struggle with the Force, with her identity and past, with trying to talk some sense into Luke and remove his inner darkness. Which brings me to...<br/><br/>2. "They ruined Luke! Luke wasn't a killer! He was a hero!"<br/><br/>I strongly disagree and argue that the filmmakers IMPROVED Luke. In the orignal trilogy he was a great character indeed but his arc ended in an admittedly pretty simplistic way: He becomes the hero. We all knew he would. But this movie shows that even heroes have some darkness inside them. Even heroes make terrible mistakes. And even heroes can feel as though there is no hope left, that their life has hit a dead end. And watching Luke gradually grow from a cynical and depressed old hermit back to the confident and kind man he once was is really emotionally satisfying. I love Luke in this film, and if he had been portrayed as a flawless, boring old wise man, it would have made the film so extremely predictable, and his return to the saga would have been just pointless fanservice instead of something brand new.<br/><br/>3. "SJW POLITICS!"<br/><br/>Seriously, people? The entire Star Wars saga is and always has been about politics. In fact, it was the prequels that featured way too much of this aspect. I'm NOT sorry by saying this - if you cannot enjoy this movie because the film touches upon a few real-world societal issues that some vile alt-right conspiracy theorist jock told you don't actually exist, you're pathetic. Yes, extreme capitalism, animal abuse and child slavery ARE BAD. This is common knowledge to anyone with a brain and a heart. And don't you dare complain about the inclusion of a few minorities or claim that this movie bashes white males. Star Wars is set in a vast galaxy home to a limitless array of races and creatures, and you're complaining that there's an Asian in it? Yeah, clearly this movie is a declaration of war on white men!<br/><br/>...In your warped mind, that is.<br/><br/>4. "They killed Snoke! What a waste!"<br/><br/>This is another thing I love about this movie. Just like with the unexpected potrayal of Luke as a sad man longing for death, I love that they opted to kill off Snoke in this film. In doing so, it showed Ben Solo/Kylo Ren's anger and desire to take full control of his life after being exploited and used as a puppet. It shows just how fragile even the most terrifying villains are and how they don't need to be these overpowered badasses who die right at the end of a trilogy in a cliché battle. Killing him off early and without a boring scene where you find out his entire backstory revealed to us that the true villain of the trilogy is the Dark Side and how it can severely corrupt people (Luke, Kylo, Poe, hell, even Rey at sometimes) and make them do selfish and/or destructive things. Simply put, Snoke was always a clever deceptive red herring, and we all fell for it in The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>In my opinion, The Last Jedi is a daring, challenging, emotionally powerful, beautifully constructed and suitably action-packed middle chapter of the sequel trilogy, and the final film is bound to be just as fantastic, if not more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8019427"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The Last Jedi is the rebellious little kid of Star Wars movies. It unashamedly broke all the rules of Star Wars. It shattered our expectations and derailed the ongoing story. It's a movie that's constantly one step ahead of the viewer and stubbornly refuses to stick to the Star Wars formula, frequently changing direction in ways that any fan of the previous movies would never expect. Oh, you thought Snoke would be the big final boss of the saga? Nope, he's dead and Kylo's taken his throne! Thought Luke was a saint with a heart of gold? Nope, he's a grump and tried to kill his nephew! Thought Rey would be revealed to be Luke's daughter or Obi-Wan's granddaughter? Nope, she's just some nobody who is uncommonly strong with the Force!<br/><br/>All of this and much more has disappointed thousands of fans, but all of these changes were necessary in order to redefine what Star Wars is and what it can be. The Last Jedi could have been a formulaic and predictable continuation of the previous film. It could have been two and a half hours of obvious fanservice. But that's not what a good movie needs to be. It needs to be daring. It needs to be shocking. It needs to be challenging. It needs to pull the rug from under your feet. And The Last Jedi does this again and again and again. And by doing this, The Last Jedi has exposed the danger of fan theories and what happens when you raise your expectations way too high. In other words, don't write the movie in your head before you see it. Just sit back and see what you get!<br/><br/>The Last Jedi is by no means perfect, but it doesn't need to be. Its impact on Star Wars history will not be forgotten. And now, the events of Episode IX are shrouded in mystery. We have no idea what will happen next, and this has made me really excited for the final chapter of the saga and the conclusion of the Skywalker family story. It's going to be a treat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

VII) but keeps letting you down over and over throught the entire movie. It has some good things, but it has even more bad things.<br/><br/>Good things about the movie: - Good visuals<br/>- New ways of using the force<br/>- Entertaining<br/><br/>Bad things about the movie:<br/>- The portrayal of Luke's character is inconsistent (lets be real, this is not the Luke we know, the hopefull guy who saw goodness in Darth Vader, now is a whiny old man who doesnt care about anyone).<br/>- Rey is still a Marie Sue (this is more a problem of ep. VII, but this movie does nothing to correct it. Rey is good at everything with no explanation, fighting bad guys? Always wins. Piloting the Millenium Falcon? Sure! Using the force for mind control and grabbing objects after learning about the force just 2 min. ago? Easy! Winning Kylo using the lighsaber for the 1st time? No problem. Lifting giant rocks with no training? I could go on and on...)<br/>- Why is Rey one of the main characteres? Besides talking to Kylo Ren and lifting some rocks what does she accomplish in this movie?<br/>- The whole casino scene is just pointless. (nothing is accomplished in this arc).<br/>- During the chase arc, why the New Order doesnt send small ships to attack the Resistance's main cruser? - Why general Holdo doesnt tell her plan to anyone? - Finn, Poe and Rey don't get any character development. (Finn had so much potential, but keeps getting blocked first by Rey and now by Rose)<br/>- Rose is pointless (there's absolutely no reason for her to be in the movie besides blocking Finn's character evolution).<br/>- There's not even a sentence about Snoke's motivations or backstory. (how did he fund the First Order? How did he find Kylo Ren and turn him to the dark side? - Phasma is wasted...again.<br/>- The humour is so... Marvel...<br/>- The knighs of Ren... no clue about them.<br/>- Leia Poppins (on paper sounds like a good thing Leia using the force, but the execution in the movie was so cringy).<br/>- There's any reason for Luke's death? (I don't mind him dying, but we get no explanation for his death... did he use all of is strength to project himself to another planet?).<br/>- American political agenda and SJW inflences (please don't bring those subjects to a Star Wars movie, this is not the right franchise to do that).<br/>- Besides Snokes death and Kylo being now the new leader, the story didn't evolve or go further from The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>Ep. IX has a lot of problems to correct. I hope it does, but I'm not hopefull.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I refused to believe it at first. Denial and rationalizations galore! "Mark Hamill is in it! Kylo Ren's character is slightly more developed from a plank of petrified wood! Princess Leia can fly through space with no helmet! Snoke dies with zero character development in the most pathetic ending to a villain in cinematic history! The graphics are nice! Who cares that the plot makes no sense and that Luke Skywalkers character was destroyed just before he dies?"<br/><br/>Nope...my denial has cracked. This movie is pure garbage. It is WORSE than the Star Wars prequels by a longshot. I never thought that was even possible, and Force Awakens and Rebel One was damn fine improvements. This movie takes a huge steaming **** on all of them. Laughable camerawork, terrible progression and the worst character development ever. Now Luke Skywalker, the hero of the galaxy is a whiny emo pessimist who **** and complains. Yoda doesn't give a **** about him burning down the Jedi Temple for no reason. Leia gets shot into space and somehow uses the Force to save her own life, but doesn't know to use to Force to prevent the Rebels from walking into a trap? ****ty pointless scenes everywhere, like the stupid casino scene which has pointless moralizing and substandard characters. All the characters are downright awful. The worst offense is Snoke, this character that was hyped to oblivion is completely useless and is betrayed by Kylo Ren in such anti-climatic fashion, untoasted white bread that is eaten on mayonnaise and stale rotting ketchup remain less mediocre in execution. The ending is god awful, what exactly does Luke Skywalker die for? So that his apprentice who gets force powers with no effort can fight the boring Kylo Ren? **** Kylo Ren, he is a terrible character who is a travesty compared to the might of Darth Vader. Did I mention how boring and disjointed everything is?! Transistions occur out of nowhere and you have no time to adjust to any scene before the director farts out another useless transistion in your face to another filler scene which goes nowhere!<br/><br/>Bottom line: The Last Jedi is the WORST Star Wars movie ever made. It is so awful it defies all logic and any sane comprehension. Avoid this monster of a film at all costs and boycott future Star Wars installments unless the entire directing team is rebuilt from the ground up. When Mark Hamill himself says he hated this movie, you know that you have officially RUINED Star Wars. Shameful display Disney...shameful abomination. Worst movie of 2018 BY FAR.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

While there are some low points about this movie, mainly storylines that didn't deserve to be so integral... The high points of this movie are some of the best in Star Wars history. The sound, visual effects and editing are the best and most meaningful they have ever been.

It's actually pretty crazy just how many fans are on each side of the argument. And while I understand why a large portion of Star Wars fans are not too pumped with it, I really enjoyed it. It takes risks that I never thought that a Star Wars movie would take, and it develops some of the characters in ways I didn't expect, and I'm fine with almost every choice Rian Johnson and LucasFilm made. I will say that my biggest problem with this film, and this is a problem I had with The Force Awakens as well, is some of the comedy. A lot of it worked, despite not necessarily being needed, but some of it took me out of the movie completely. This is a movie set in a different galaxy during a different time period, but yet we were given some 2017-based humor. I get it; a sure fire way to make sure a joke lands with a lot of casual fans is to use topical humor...but it really doesn't work in some parts of this film. They've gone all in on this type of comedy, though, so I guess I might as well get used to it.<br/><br/>The visuals of this film were incredible. Some of the best of the saga, if not the best. There's one scene in particular that caused my mouth to drop. It was extraordinary looking. And while I don't want to get into spoiler territory, many of you who have already seen the film will probably know the scene I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Character development, and some of the choices the characters make, is what I feel like has divided the fanbase the most. As I stated earlier, I was pretty satisfied with a lot of the choices made in regards to the characters in this movie. There's only one moment that has me teetering more towards siding with the fans who are upset, and it has to do with a flashback scene involving Luke. After letting it marinate for a while, I've come to accept it more or less, but I was a bit perplexed when I first witnessed the scene. I was satisfied with the story as a whole. The first half was a bit slow for my liking, but it makes up for it with the second half that moves at a blistering pace. I think that this film has set us up for a very interesting ninth installment, which could potentially be the best of the trilogy. In the end, The Last Jedi gave me exactly what I was hoping for, with some surprises sprinkled throughout. I'm looking forward to seeing it again soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The fact that the critics loved it is evidence of Disney's terrifying control over the media.  1. Too long, 2. Poor acting by most except Driver and Hamill (Ridley okay), 3. Canto Bight, 4. Out of gas space chase, 5. Luke is portrayed as a confused coward.  Better he would have just been the villain.  6. The Porgs/obvious merchandising, 7. the replay of Hoth at end, 8. Superman Leia, 9. Ackbar dies off screen, and 10. Admiral Purple Hair (great actress) awful character, and 11. Do not even let me discuss the atrocious Rose/Finn plot line and the Phasma atrocity.  At least Phantom Menace knew it was for kids.  Last Jedi has such cringe worthy kiddie moments combined with over the top Star Wars violence that it makes sense who this movie was targeted at other than reviewers paid off by Disney.  There is no honest review that says this is a good film.  If you are not a big Wars fan, you may not hate it.  There are a couple beautiful shots and some of the special effects are great.  (Canto Bight a MAJOR exception).  But no one would call this a classic or even remotely compare it to the originals.  My son summed it up best in two short sentences: "There was no big sword fight. That was boring dad."  Rian Johnson should never be allowed near a script again, but shame on Kathleen Kennedy and everyone at Disney who thought this neophyte should be trusted to draft the second installment of a major franchise.  Zero credentials as a script writer and dubious credentials as a director.  As much as Johnson is being slammed and deserves to be slammed, most of the blame must fall on the executives who green lit this buffoon and allowed this travesty to hit the theaters.  Yes, it made a fortune because we all loved Star Wars.

George needed to remain as the creative oversight for the sequel trilogy. It would've been okay to give directors and writers creative control with the anthology films since they're just small stories in the larger universe, without George this franchise cannot survive, there is no outline or map of where this is all going, just remastered films of the originals. TLJ is a true showcase of what's wrong with Disney's Star Wars, a franchise which rides on nostalgia and not world building and interesting characters. TLJ is written in a way that disregards everything built up in the last film, it doesn't move the story in a meaningful way. I just hope there's a real course correction before they turn Star Wars into this soulless thing of what it once was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Just, the plot. I have to talk about the plot.<br/><br/>My first issue with the plot is based around character development. This is in the fact characters get better as you go along the lines of the series. We understand their weaknesses and strengths and become familiar and that we can relate to them, however instead, Rey (she already seemed abnormally good at flying, could even be better than Poe without even having experience), has beaten KYLO REN for the SECOND time through the force. One, we don't know who Rey's parents are, and thanks to Kylo always telling her she's nothing we just eventually become uninterested, and two, Kylo Ren... THE GRANDSON OF ANAKIN SKYWALKER, WHAT? You don't expect embarrassment to catch up on a scale like this. Snoke is killed in the second movie, so not only a young Kylo Ren is just been stripped of his proper potential but a character we were so fascinated by has just been killed by Rian Johnson. Despite this surprise being well played, it was better for it to be saved for a later time. Vice Admiral Holdo was not only introduced in this movie, but died on this movie too, an absolute shame. I'll list replacements from the originals if you want:<br/><br/>Vice Admiral Holdo (Admiral Ackbar, war hero and loved by all fans) (Lando Calrissian, a real showman and also loved dearly as a friend of Han Solo and Leia Organa).<br/><br/>We didn't know who this woman was, and I do wonder how she was not in any of the originals if she was Leia's FRIEND. Admiral Ackbar died AS A BACKGROUND CHARACTER, and Lando wasn't even IN the movie. Rubbish, these two are so dear to my heart, personally.<br/><br/>Second point: Comic Relief. The command structure of the First Order seems drastically unprofessional and a four-year-old could see that the Resistance were so cramped together in that space battle that one ship flying down would've sent another tumbling. It's not a matter of who's smarter (Original AND prequel series) whoever wins is simply who's less stupid and incompetent. C3P0 is loved for his stress-releaser for Han, Chewie, Luke and R2-D2 on the Falcon, but really the humour now seems so forced. Luke drinking the green milk was disturbing, he's LUKE SKYWALKER. Not only that but he takes the mick out of the force. Leia and Holdo seem so harsh on Poe it's not even chuckle-able anymore, and the scene with Finn shooting water all over the place when he wakes up could've been executed better. General Hux (who in the Force Awakens I could say deserved to be the successor to Tarkin) is the centre of abuse even by the Resistance, who are not afraid to CALL this dude just for laughs. If anything, Hux has been ruined just for the sake of laughter, he doesn't deserve to be the sequel version of Tarkin anymore. Nothing quoteable in this new trilogy and he literally is even more of a joke than Rose and Finn's relationship...<br/><br/>I've got to say, Captain Phasma did some cool stuff in the movie, including the fight with Finn. It was not only well made, but we know for sure Finn is able to, as he was one of the best people in the FN corps. Phasma shows determination and ability, but we see weakness in her selfishness and desire to always live. EXCELLENT CHARACTER! She's presumed dead, but I do hope she'll come back on the finale, as she's pretty cool and very unique.<br/><br/>I would say Kylo had little improvement, and not only that but since he refused to become good again and killed off both Snoke and Skywalker, his potential is capped. He will NOT learn anything, or very little, and despite him being my favourite SW character EVER, I feel very sad that this is the height of his power, simply inferior in almost every way to a scavenger on Jakku. Adam Driver's performance was yet again stunning, MUCH MUCH applause to him for his talent.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's quite clear switching directors midway through a trilogy isn't a good idea. Not only were ideas, concepts and theories thrown away, but characters were wasted at basic developing stage, but Disney doesn't know there's only one more movie left. Where's the development?<br/><br/>I thought Rey would be a relatable and revolutionary hero. Nope. Basically putting out a message that some people can just be good at anything (her) and others have to improve (Kylo, Finn, Phasma) is pretty much a demotivation for young people looking up to any sort of hero. If you're looking for a hero to look up to, Luke Skywalker, Jyn Erso, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn are obvious examples from Star Wars. Even mention Biggs Darklighter, Yoda, Anakin. They represent Sacrifice, Knowledge and Learning, and Determination and Ambition to me, and their flaws made them great characters with huge development.<br/><br/>There's me out. I suppose I could talk more but, overall, the work put into this movie is good, yet the plot destroyed around 6 points in this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

You will accomplish more and have more fun doing utterly nothing.<br/><br/>No character depth, untold amounts of plot holes, and above all identity politics. If you support random insertions of people simply due to their skin color rather than a fit for the role, then this is your movie. I am still trying to figure out the asian girl's purpose. What was her role and why was she even in this movie other than the fact to bump the diversity ratings up a hair?<br/><br/>Another note, all of the women held the positions of power while they delegated their authoritarian-like power to all of the men; but when someone would challenge the decision, the woman in power would essentially say "I'm with her, do as I say because reasons."<br/><br/>P.S. the critics are extremely disconnected with the viewers. That fact is just as disappointing as this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is a sad day when it can be said that the Jar-jar trilogy was better than this vapid and pandering commercial “success”.<br/><br/>I am glad I missed this one in cinema, and I will be certain to stay away from this Pirates of the Caribbean rebrand in future.   If I had the time, I would check to see if the same writers contributed to this one, but I cant be bothered, and I will definitely not be surprised.<br/><br/>If the next installment is going to be the same, they should rather, seeing as we don’t have a Disney channel where I’m from, do a direct to Nickelodeon release instead.<br/><br/>They should also bar everyone who worked on the movies, and their families, from making “reviews”, so that I can actually see what the one person who actually liked it, liked about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Have given it 3 as there is some merit for the younger children. In my view, it is astonishing how Lucas / Disney have destroyed Star Wars. It is also astonishing how the critics are too scared to talk this film down. The facts are : Cinema would be no more if the studios did not have Star Wars films to hype people into theaters. I'm so glad I waited until dvd. When you compare to the episodes 4,5,6 obviously the film would never have any chance, but even 1 (yes 1),2 and 3 are better in my view.  The stupidity of this film is taken to new highs and yes Sci Fi can be done sensibly. Star Wars has now invented the long range / hyper space video conference call. Space Travel now all blue like if in Doctor Who Tardis.  The usual trend of introducing pointless characters and then killing them, expecting us to care. The big bad cheese looks like out of Tom and Jerry. General Hus looks and is played as if should be in a Harry Potter movie. I could go on, like the film.

It didn't feel like a Star Wars movie is the superficial description of the malignant issue at hand, despite what individuals defending the film may claim (trust me, most of us love women and didn't really notice or mind those themes. We wanted space battles, cool bad guys, interesting world building/characters, and lightsabers dammit! Stop redirecting the issue at hand in a way reminiscent of the current gun violence issue). It took two hours following the film for me to move past denial, and realize that the film was terrible and I hated it. There's more to it, but no one has time for all of that. It was the most emotionally disappointing movie I've seen in my entire life. Never thought I wouldn't care about seeing another new Star Wars movie again, but Rian Johnson proved me wrong. For what it's worth, the only good parts of the film were Mark Hamill's excellent (if uncharacteristic) performance, and that Praetorian Guard Fight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If you stop, put your assumptions about what a jedi is or is not aside, and witness what is happening you will quickly see that the torch has been passed.  Star Wars cannot continue to be about a dark overlord who rules everything and pulls on the puppet strings of another in order to maintain his control over a galaxy.  Anyone wanting that should simply stop with the original trilogy.  What you saw here was Luke admitting a failure and trying to redeem himself with his one final act.  Leia showing the wisdom of a seasoned general, but knowing that a great leader has to trust those around her.  Rey on her own discovery to find out who she really is, only to be met by more questions, and then Kylo Ren offering to give her answers, only to end up misleading her and trying to claim power for himself.  Before you judge harshly wait until the third movie in the trilogy releases, and see what the decisions in The Last Jedi actually set into motion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke has been destroyed, Rose is a totally pointness addition that adds absolutely nothing to the plot and is only there to make the movie as diverse as possible (nothing wrong with racial diversity, just a little much when e v e r y new non-evil charachter must not be a white male). Rey seems to have no character flaws and is a complete Mary Sue. Every character (accept Luke) undergoes no developmental changes and is the exact same as they were at the beginning of the movie. Sometimes I wonder if Rian Johnson even watched TFA, because every single valuable plot point from TFA was completely ignored or destroyed, especially Rey's Parents, which I thought had so much potential but was completely thrown away. Kylo Ren is no longer a intimidating bad guy like he was in TFA, he acts more like a enraged 6 year old with scizophrenia in the movie more than an actually Sith. Such a shame. TFA was okay and it gave great openings for a potentially amazing Episode 8. Unfortunately, any possibilities for a good sequel trilogy have been completely squashed by Rian Johnson and his band of money-hungry SJWs. Absolute abomination.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie is not good.  Not good at all.  I expected it to be a bit campy and maybe not "film" material given that it is star wars but I watched on an airplane and I really wish I could have my two hours back.  It's heavy-handed with its messages, its jokes do not land, and it really fails to make one care one bit about its cast of characters.  Oh, and it starts with a drawn-out "being on hold" joke... yes, in a universe with no telephones.  I know everyone hates on the prequels and, yes, the prequels are worse than the original three movies (well, maybe, if we're honest, worse than the empire strikes back and about as good as the other two) but these recent three abortions cannot hope to hold a candle to the prequels...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The negative reviews for this... well the fact that most of them are ‘1’ or ‘0’ just shows you how stupid and unobjective people are capable of being when they’re supposed to be reviewing a movie which at the very least is very well made. So what are they really doing. Venting their spleen because they live in their own little fantasy world of how their favorite movie series should pan out and it didn’t happen the way they would’ve wanted. Well, boo-bloody-hoo. Wake up! There’s a whole world of cinematic works of art out there and this is one of them. This is the most truly adult of the Star Wars movies. Nowhere near as much of the old good-cowboys-wear-white-hats and bad-cowboys-wear-black-hats as usual, and it’s miles better for it. Not only a refresh the franchise needed to stay relevant, but a great movie too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As a huge Star Wars fan, I tried so hard to like this movie, but it failed in almost all categories. The movie is driven on continuous plot conveniences and has countless plot holes. All of the characters were lazily written and uninspiring. There was no satisfying ending to any of the plot points and some plot points from episode 7 were completely ignored. The movie continuously contradicts the rules and lore in the originals and prequels. Even worse, it contradicts itself a few occasions. The writing of the script felt childish. Words like "tooling" and "unfindable" have no place in Star Wars. The numerous attempts at comedy failed miserably. They felt so out of place and ruined the immersion.

It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter how big or small of Star Wars fan you might be--if you've seen them, you have strong feelings about either way.<br/>That being said, I really do believe The Last Jedi is among my favorite overall. While it does feel very different in tone, theme, and structure (somewhat), the film itself feels like an allegory arguing over its own identity in the Star Wars Universe and is executed in such a way that is bold, very respectable, and very entertaining to watch.<br/>Whereas with the original trilogy, and even the prequels, the film was setup to abide by a Greek Tragedy structure, centering around the biggest and most central players in the galaxy only. It is a story about family dysfunction contextualized in the center of conflict on a galactic scale.<br/>The Last Jedi solidifies that this is not the direction the Disney Star Wars Universe is headed in, love it or hate it. I just see this as different; it is Disney realizing there is no way to expand the Universe of their newly acquired property without separating itself gradually, and through these new films, to do so. In a story telling schematic, I think it is a bold choice that offers the opportunity to allow stories that, before under George Lucas, could and would never have happened. The dark undertones, both thematically and visually, make the film start to really feel like a war movie.<br/>Allegorical Representation I read into:<br/>The Resistance ship using thrusters only to stay just out of reach from the First order. I perceive this as the Resistance represents Disney making every attempt it can to lead Star Wars to a new place where it will be able to thrive and become wonderful for everyone again, Po is the audience trying to follow faithfully but skeptical of the decision making abilities of the new admiral in charge (throwing critical question after question), and the First Order is the first interpretation of Star Wars/also the "negative Nancy" that will never let itself be happy with the new Star Wars ever. Luke Skywalker represents the faithful Star Wars fan that is terrified to lose control over the direction Star Wars is heading in. Kylo Ren represents all of the fans that are only negative about the new movies; he wants it all to end, the Jedi and the Sith--he wants everything to stop. So much so, that Kylo kills the "new Emperor," in a fairly anticlimactic way to avoid any chance of history repeating itself in these movies.<br/>Things I really appreciated in this movie:<br/>-Expanding the scope of the Galaxy, and how the wars effect other people (specifically, the "more normal" individuals)<br/>-Creating morally gray areas in the war, including the commentary that very briefly touches on the war profiteers. Especially when it is revealed that the ship DJ steals is from someone who sells ships to the First Order and the Resistance, it begs the question, "Why are the wars at all?" to be asked. -The way Luke is made to contextualize the original trilogy, it's almost as if Luke is saying the way that part of the Star Wars history line is perceived within the universe is that it is exaggerated, almost mythical, and somewhat misunderstood. This grounds the Greek Tragedy epicness in many ways; we are made to see Luke not as a super hero/master jedi that is without character flaws, but instead a single being who feels just as powerless in the universe as anybody else might. -There is a lot of emphasis on the fact that wars cannot be won by individuals, but by groups of individuals working together.<br/>The only things I really did not enjoy, or simply felt indifferent about:<br/>-Finn. While in the Force Awakens he's pretty great, his character in this one feels so out of place with the tone that was established. His dialogue were only quick whips, none of which were really at all creative. To boot, they gave him an arc that really didn't make any difference in the outcome of the movie. I just don't get it and I don't find him appealing. He feels like a really immature and goofy character for a film that is so dark and serious.<br/>-Porgs. Except for one gag in the end, they are the Minions of the Star Wars universe as far as I am concerned.<br/>Things I was confused about:<br/>-Maz Kanata's appearance in the movie. It was entirely unnecessary, and just didn't really connect to the story. It also didn't make any sense how she was (essentially) facetiming with the resistance. Who was holding the camera? How was this call being taken? Was the camera shot after she jet packs away from the camera?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Instead of finding a creative way to play with the viewers expectations and take the universe into a bold new direction, The Last Jedi treats us to 2.5 hours of dumb characters doing dumb things that are ultimately pointless by the end of the film. Returning characters are underwritten and never find their footing while new characters are uninteresting and annoying. Rose just might be the Jar Jar Binks of this generation.<br/><br/>1 star for bringing back muppet Yoda.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They act like they are entitled to see what they want in a Star Wars film. Wake up call, you don't own Star Wars.

You theorize every little detail in the movies and trailers and set your expectations over the sun and then you wonder why you hated it. YOU are the reason that you hate this movie, not Rian Johnson. Anyways, now onto the review. The Last Jedi improves on the Force Awakens in many ways except pacing. This movie is a fresh new take on Star Wars that is incredibly entertaining and incredibly smart. This movie finally does what the other films preach about and it tells us to leave the past behind. It's important but the future is just as important. Now, the only reason why I like the Force Awakens more is that it has better pacing. This film really drags in the second act with the Casino scene and then after that, it becomes amazing again.The Last Jedi has really high highs and is a fresh new take on Star Wars.

This movie made me feel sad and confused... Rian Johnson made such a focused effort to subvert your expectations that you become numb to the random "GOTCHA" moments throughout this film. Conflict is created for the sake of conflict, and characters are beat down contrary to their established arcs just to elevate other characters. I love Rey, I love Jyn (I love strong women in general, Sarah Conner for example) but Holdo and Rose were horrible characters that were forced in to make a political point. It was either telling the audience that Poe is a moron hot shot loser, or that saving space horses is more important than the mission. This movie has criticisms of capitalism... the same capitalism that allowed Disney to buy a monopoly of the entertainment system... the same system that makes them billions of dollars per year. I don't need to be preached at in my Star Wars, I need to escape to a Galaxy Far Far Away. Summary:<br/><br/>Negatives<br/><br/>- Horrible new characters<br/>- Previous characters are totally uncharacteristic and untrue to themselves<br/>- Rian Johnson Breaks the Force<br/>- #JusticeforAkbar<br/><br/>Positives<br/><br/>- Throne room<br/>- Hyperspace (even though it breaks canon)<br/>- Adam Driver's performance</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But it has very poor payoff.  Conflicts get resolved too easily.  We have no sense of peril.  The story is allowed to meander off to a completely unrelated planet by a cheap mechanism of buying time for the doomed rebellion for no valid reason, then conflicts just resolve.  What's most important: to be a member of the First Order the first criteria is to be incredibly dumb.  Dumb villains eliminate any sense of danger.

I have never seen so many plot holes in one movie. Let's start from the beginning - If Luke wanted no one to find him, WHY DID HE LEAVE A **** MAP INSIDE R2???!! Where did Luke's lightsaber come from? (Still a plot hole) Why is Leia superman and can now survive an explosion and air sucked out of her lungs? Why didn't the Leia replacement tell Poe that they were just trying to get to a planet? Poe almost killed everyone and the whole thing could've been stopped with 2 sentences. Why doesn't Kylo Ren realize that Luke was a Force projection if HE JUST BROKE THE LIGHTSABER LUKE WAS HOLDING??!! Why did the AT-AT's not shoot Finn and Rose if they were right in front of them speaking? Why can Yoda use the force if he is **** DEAD?! And if Force Ghosts can now use the Force, why didn't Obi-Wan and Yoda just blow up the Death Star in the original trilogy? It would've saved many lives and resources. How can one X-Wing pilot destroy an entire First Order carrier? There are many more, but the last one i noticed is a completely incompetent plot hole, that made me feel like an infant wrote this movie. If Snoke is so strong with the Force that he can literally connect two minds together just by the power of thought, HOW DID HE NOT NOTICE A MOTHER**** RUSTY-ASS LIGHTSABER MOVING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM????!!!! I hate this movie, **** you Rian Johnson, you **** **** for ruining one of my favorite franchises of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke denigrated to the worst garbage of human being and with powers ridiculous for a Jedi, he died stupidly, please remake this film, this film should never had existed.I don't say that it is a bad movie because Luke died, in Episode VII Han Solo died and killed the possibility to ever play together with Luke again, but anyway I liked the movie as it was a decent plot, if you are going to kill a super idol do it for a good reason, like it was done in Episode 7, not kill him because he got tired after use too much Jedi Power and leave episode 9 with nobody, even with a good plot you should be very careful if kill the Luke, now everybody is dead as Carrie Fisher died in the real world, whats the point of Episode 9? Who will be the stars, Chewbacca and androids? Unless they bring Lando to episode 9 for sure only teenagers will go to cinema to watch it. I left my family in Christmas to go to watch this abomination, for a Star Wars movie, anyone would understand, but leave Christmas for this garbage? Most of fans say "pretend that this movie never existed" but it is difficult, specially that there will be an episode 9.

That part with the animal was so disturbing in fact I wished I have never seen it. I'm Boycotting the Han Solo movie because I'm fed up with Disney ruining my favorite movie franchise.

There was WAY too much time spent on useless and/or annoying scenes. The humor took away from the more serious nature of the movie and that pretty much explains the feel of the entire film. That it just isn't taken seriously. Sadly, I dislike most of the characters, Snoke was not only ill conceived but also killed without truly ever having a moment in these last two movies where he felt like he was the Sith Lord. He gets very little scene time, and monomim background and is eliminated in such a way that felt unworthy of a story antagonist. Then it's followed by a scene that makes no sense in Star Wars which is the "Emperor's Royal Guard" wielding all sorts of weapons (a sword like whip, a  staff that turns into 2 axe like weapons, and so on) These baffoons took Rey and kylo too long to eliminate not to mention no force powers were used and from the looks of it if there were about six more of them they could have defeated both Rey and Kylo from how much they struggled with them. Considering he is taking over as Sith Lord (or Supreme Leader) and Rey as The Last Jedi this is simply another very small piece that adds to the whole film simply missing it's mark. I love how J.J. Abrams remade Star Trek and again, I grew up liking Star Wars not Trek and to be honest I feel that J.J. Abrams ruined Star Wars and there is nothing I liked about this movie from start to end thus I gave it a 0. I could explain so much more but I feel that the movie was so bad that I simply cannot spend any more of my time on thinking or speaking about it as it is actually wasting my life. I even turned it off twice because I just couldn't bare to sit thru it in its entirety. So 0 out of 10 Absolute disgrace and sadly the end of my childhood favorite film series since I could care less how the last film turns out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I disliked the character development or at times lack there of as well as missing backstories. There is also an awkward humor that ensues throughout the movie that at most times I didn't realize was supposed to be funny.<br/><br/>I thought the plot between Holdo and Poe was just silly.  Frankly, I thought Holdo was supposed to be a bad guy who was actually working for the first order. When she sacrificed herself, I was confused why the hyperspace jump like that wasn't done sooner.  A female in charge doesn't bother me, but the bad story line for this character does.  It could have been so much better if she had say there was a spy on board, or if she was a spy on board.  I really found her leadership lacking in the way the movie portrayed the character.<br/><br/>The Canto Bight portion could have been completely skipped.  In my mind it really didn't add value to the movie and ended up being virtually pointless other than to offer Fin and Phasma the chance to square off, but wasn't worth the time put into it.  I would have like Rey's character if there was more development that could happen.  One of the things I enjoyed about Luke in episodes 4-6 is the growth he undergoes.  Rey comes to her abilities too quickly and I don't feel really faces challenges that grow her into her powers.  Instead she seemingly is able to get herself out of every situation without failing.<br/><br/>As a whole, I wouldn't recommend this movie.  The overall Plot and Sub-Plots were lacking in detail and arc development.  As a whole, this is not a movie I would recommend watching or buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not the predictable story rehash we got with Episode 7. Some things are somewhat dumb slapstick and quite a few protagonists will definitely not be making Episode 9, but overall it's quite surprising and refreshing movie. Some scenes still give a fan the "Now where have we seen this before?" feeling but I guess it wouldn't be Star Wars if it didn't. There are some elements that really sort of break the "logic" of Star Wars universe. If you take SW seriously and not as entertainment you might be offended by what Disney did with this movie. Get over it, it's "Science Fantasy".</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie just lacked substance and story. It gave the audience more questions and answered largely anticipated questions horribly...It was also full of plot holes and just ruined long time loved characters from the original trilogy. Episode VII did a good job setting this movie up for success, but this movie just was a dump on the series. When Disney bought Star Wars, I feared they would kill it...and this movie is my fears come true.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8236601"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I can't possibly write a review the way I would like to in just the 5k characters allowed. There are way too many things that people complained about.  Some of them make sense while most of them do not.  This is a reboot in many ways and old school fans (of which I am one) were pissed.  You have a right to be, but not on all the nitpicking b.s. that you have done.  Even so, let's start with the bad.  I have two major issues with this movie which I will not forgive (and they are huge ones).  And yet I still love the movie despite of it...<br/><br/>General Leia floating back to the ship.  Rian Wilson took alot of what was sacred in the franchise and turned it on it's ass.  I agreed with many of his decisions but not this one.  The easiest way to say what's wrong with this idea is simple.  We have known that Leia has the force and has chosen not to use it much.  So be it; if she changes her mind, no big deal, she has the right to do so and we can't complain.  UNLESS, you take something that has been in seven movies before it, over a span of 40 years, and decide to add a new aspect of it.  One that has never been introduced- or even hinted at- before.  So basically, all of a sudden Jedi can crystalize (?) and float through outer space?  If that were the case, it should have been brought up way before now. You can't invent something just to move a scene forward or keep someone alive.  That simple.  Besides that, quite honestly, it just looked cheesy as hell.<br/><br/>My second major issue is basically the same thing (the use of the force) but in this case it comes at the end of the movie.  And since it is the climax of the movie it kinda sorta brings you to a crashing halt.  I'm referring to Luke's ability to transport himself to another location.  Again...it's never been done before now and hasn't even been eluded to prior.  And since you're dealing with a lot of other source material, you can't just make it up for the sake of what you want to do...just because.  What makes it worse is: every- thing leading up to it is pretty awesome.  I have no issue with Luke dying, but it would have been a much better ending had he done everything that he did and actually, you know, been there.<br/><br/>What's good about the movie is basically everything else.  You can argue that the Casino scene is unnecessary and you wouldn't be wrong.  And truth be told, I could have lived without seeing most of it.  So be it.  I still don't despise it like so many others.<br/><br/>The evacuation scene and the new ship the dreadnaught: awesome.  The bombing of said ship also awesome.  Seeing the inside of a tie fighter while BB 88 fixes it: great minor detail.  Luke's pessimism: I think that direction was very smart.  Especially the idea of showing both sides of what happened between him and Kylo Ren to make Ren turn to the dark side.  Very believable story line.  Speaking of Kylo Ren; I can't say how great of an evil villan he turned out to be.  That may be Rian Wilson's greatest idea.  Snoke dying: love it.  Many people were mad but really, he wasn't that interesting.  Great idea to surprise the audience and a great way that it was done.  The fight scene in Snoke's lair: the best fight scene we've seen in a Star Wars movie and a great plot in regards to the relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey.  Yoda's return: Yoda's return!!  Not a CGI look alike but the actual puppet!!  Genius idea.  And the whole scene with him was amazing as well as emotional.  This is a good way in which Rian Wilson shook up the whole franchise for the better.  The friction between Poe and General Leia: another great plot point that worked on many levels.  Vice Admiral Holdo: of course she's tied in to Poe and Leia and the back and forth of what's going on between the 3 of them kept me guessing.  Star Wars is normally black and white, but this plot kept the audience wondering who was right and who was wrong.  So, again, the Casino scene with Finn may have not been necessary but it did have to do with the Poe/Leia/Holdo power struggle so it served it's purpose.  Also, let me say right now that Holdo sacrificing herself and charging a Star Destroyer by going into light speed...cinematically, one of the best shot scenes I've ever seen.  Not just in a Star Wars film, but any film. Kylo Ren & Ray communicating telepathically: the opposite of my complaints of what you can or can't do with the force.  This has been shown to a lesser extent in other movies, so the leap is not jarring and it works very well.  Rey's dream: confusing but I think I understand it.  Either way, looks brilliant.<br/><br/>Battle of Crait: like I said, I loved every aspect of this ending except for the fact that Luke wasn't actually there.  There are so many smaller details that I just don't have the time or room to do that helps explain why I like this movie so much.  In the end, I don't care what anyone says...in no way was this film worse than Episode I, II or III.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It takes Star Wars and attempts to turn it into a cutesy Disney movie. Leia Gets blown into space without a suit and they have her come back into the ship using the Force, when Leia doesn't even have enough Force control to part clouds without straining to the point of nearly passing out. Then having Luke be the worst Jedi master of all time, refusing to train Rey for 90% of the movie, just so that she can somehow come to equal terms with a fully trained Sith Lord. Then there's Yoda going and destroying ancient Jedi texts, which would not only never happen, but they also would not be books. They would have been datapads since books have been replaced for over 1000 years. This movie was so horrible that I sent Disney an email asking them WTF they think they're doing with Star Wars. If you're considering this movie, run away, run as fast as you possibly can!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In current North American culture, we have three things going on here that boosts The Last Jedi to unreasonable heights.<br/><br/>1. Star Wars nostalgia: As long as a Star Wars film is not too terrible, it gets a plus +1 because of the nostalgia factor.<br/><br/>2. Disney domination: The critics are unwilling to disparage a Disney flagship franchise like the Star Wars, due to the company's complete dominance over the movie industry.<br/><br/>3. PC culture: Critics are ideological fellow-travelers of the 'enlightened' Hollywood talking heads who push PC culture down our throats, and they always give an extra mark for any movie that features 'strong, independent' women.

For me, it's a good space drama with a solid and mostly coherent story, until now. This latest movie assumes that all of a sudden, fans don't care about plot holes or lore. Some character motivations are outright stupid. Technology/physics in the universe all of a sudden changes and becomes stupid to serve the silly plot. Characters gain powers suddenly that they didn't have before. And other characters just don't act like they used to.<br/><br/>Even with not being a fan of the series, I was able to pick up on all of this, and it gave me a "wtf is this crap" vibe by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I'm amazed that such a production was possible. Did no one have issues with the script? Was everyone involved incompetent? If I was a fan, I'd be outraged. But I'm not, so I'll just remember this movie as another one of hollywood's forgettable failures (of which there are many).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A lot of people hate this movie because they thought they were gonna be right about every single moment in this movie. We all thought that Snoke would get a backstory, Rey and/or Kylo would switch sides, and that Reys father would be Luke. Instead, Snoke dies, no one turns (in-fact Kylo becomes Supreme leader of the first order), and Reys' parents would be Luke. Honestly, I came out of the theater thinking that this beat the Empire Strikes Back by a mile as the best Star Wars movie. Looking back tho, there is one big flaw with the movie: The Rose and Fin sub plot. In the movie, Fin and Rose go to a luxury planet called Cantonica to find a code breaker to get aboard a Star Destroyer. There it's revealed that underneath the planets first world core is a dark, sinister child slavery underbelly. They also free a bunch of horse animal... things from captivity, and it was VERY preachy about it. There was another scene where Fin was about to sacrifice himself for the resistance, and then all of a sudden, Rose crashes into him, and letting the empire use the Battering Ram Cannon. Ultimately, the subplot seems forced in most cases, was not handled well, and is the only thing keeping this from a 9 or a 10, sadly. But I'm going to say this to my fellow Star Wars fans, STOP OVER REACTING! YOU WERE WRONG, EVERYONE WAS UNPREDICTABLE, GET OVER IT!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Heck, I didn't consider myself a star wars aficionado at all and this movie still made me irrationally angry about the treatment of the characters (specifically Luke). *rant begin* If this was anything but Star Wars the critics would have taken it to school over the lack of consistent tone (weird and off-putting humor abounds in what are otherwise supposed to be significant and awesome moments. And yes, there is a "your mom" joke in the first 5 minutes), the lack of character growth, the lack of physics/ any real rules in this universe now, and the overall disjointedness of the plot (Watch Disney shoehorn in a completely useless subplot to take a shot at rich aristocrats. Look, I hate rich aristocrats as much as the next person, but it comes off as hypocritical when Disney is simultaneously beating small theater owners into submission with new screening demands.). Every critic's newspaper that published a glowing review of this mess is trying to divert attention and say that all the bad reviews are from the alt-right people who can't stand feminists. But hey, the alternative would be to admit that they are really just in Disney's pockets. I guess the alt-right boogeymen story will have to do. I voted for Hillary. I didn't vote for Star Wars to turn into a ham-fisted attempt at social commentary. These movies were supposed to be an escape. A chance to take your mind off of the bitter division in today's politics and believe in real heroes again. Sadly, the only escape you will get from this movie is when the lights come on and you can move on with your life and accept that these movies aren't for you anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The feminist undertones were there, and is Star Wars better for it - a resounding NO. The "humor" fell flat. It's also way too long. I was going for the Empire, ahhh I mean First order, by the end. The only good thing about The last jedi will be the Plinkett review.<br/><br/>FYI. Bombs are only applicable when there's gravity.<br/><br/>Update: After letting The last jedi sink in, a few things have become apparent. First, as a stand alone film, The last jedi isn't terrible, but as a follow up to The force awakens, it is garbage. I can see why Star wars fans hated it. Rian Johnson (the writer/director) basically flipped off every Star wars fan out there. He took a huge dump on everything that was set up in The force awakens. Who was Snoke, who are Rei's parents? Such potential for story development was wasted. The last jedi should be struck from the record and they should try again with Star wars 8.1. I seriously doubt any degree of course correction in Star wars 9 could make up for The last jedi. BTW. Disney, good luck selling toys for whiny emasculated male characters and irritating SJW/feminism-driven female characters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But this movie is the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen and the biggest movie disappointment of the decade. Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>This movie is just littered with plot holes, it feels like they scraped all their ideas from episode 7 and just came up with their own dumb ideas. The movie fails so early on when they pick up from where episode 7 ended. The introduction to Luke's character is insulting. How incredibly disrespectful to have Luke to throw his fathers lightsaber like that, just for extremely poor comedy. It is just terrible they made one of my favorite fictional heroes into an unlikable, cowardly idiot who apparently has not learned anything over the years. Sure he has learned some new powers, but apperantly he has forgotten everything from the Original Trilogy. He faced his own darkness and won, this internal struggle he goes through was so incredibly unnecessary because he has already faced his own darkness before. They pretty much just turned Luke into a worse version of Yoda. And the big set piece showcase at the end of the movie is so poorly handled that it comes across as a parody. And the worst part is that they also kill him off in the dumbest way possible... His motives also does not make any sense for his character. Such as he does not want anything to do with anyone, but then why did he leave the map for his location in episode 7? Why did he even travel specifically to the first Jedi temple for no real purpose? Why would a character that risked everything to save his friends and his father, somehow just abandon everyone? Even at one point he wanted to kill his own nephew and at the end he says Kylo is completely lost and can't be save anymore. Even Leia agrees with him, are you kidding me!? Luke who saved Vader, who was way more corrupted by the Dark Side than Kylo is, somehow just abandons Kylo Ren to the Dark Side... I never thought I would say this, but I really hate Luke in this movie, because I don't even recognize him as the same character. Mark Hamill is an amazing actor, but I did not feel like I was watching Luke at all... But enough about Luke, I got to move on.<br/><br/><br/>The whole story arc with Finn, Rose and Poe is completely pointless. It leads to nothing, or actually it leads to the deaths of a lot of resistance members. Had they not done anything in the movie, then it would probably have turned out much better. So why would I like these character now when they are just characters who make terrible choices that leads to lots of deaths. And why did not that Holdo woman just tell them the plan, then none of that would have happened.<br/><br/>They also ruined the character of Rey as now she is just someone with no special lineage, but somehow she is beyond powerful even though she has had no training. I did not like that people called her a Mary Sue in TFA, because I always thought there had to be a reason for why she is so powerful. But no, she truly is a Mary Sue and completely one dimensional. I don't care anymore about her character anymore as she has not earned her powers or her place as a real heroine. It also cheapens the force as now it is trivial, anyone can somehow become more powerful than those who have been conceived by the force itself. Small kids can force pull brooms with no guidance or training at all.  And who is Snoke? Why is he so powerful? Who knows, they kill him off and leaves another plot hole. And he is like this super powerful sith who can connect Kylo and Rey together from across the galaxy... But somehow can't notice Kylo Ren betraying him in the dumbest way possible. And why did not Kylo Ren use his force powers in the fight that followed?<br/><br/>The writing in this movie is just horrible. So many hamfisted plot points that makes no sense, pointless characters like Rose has way too much screen time for no real reason. One can say that the laws of nature and physics is important in fictionl works such as Star Wars. But when you break the rules in the same movie, then it is a problem. As we are shown that bombs fall inn space in the beginning, but we are shown that there is vacum in space when Leia gets blasted. So did the writers just forgo any form of logic here? There are some cool action sequences and visual scenes, the music and cinematography is amazing. But that is the only thing this movie has going for it and when the context that those aspects are supposed to enhance is complete garbage, it becomes irrelevant. This movie is far below average, I can't believe how bad this movie turned out. And it is baffling to me that such a stupid movie riddled with plot holes have critics praising it. These are supposed to be professional reviewers, how can they not see the glaring issues in this movie? Really shows that one should never trust them.<br/><br/>I do have to congratulate Disney, you ruined the saga for a life time fan. I really have no more interest in this story anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Things that I liked - the visuals are stunning, with only a few minor cgi issues.  Cinematography, lighting, set design, costumes, all of it was incredible.  The music is a step up from The Force Awakens, and I enjoyed it.  There is some good acting, mostly from the older cast.  Now for the negatives.  The story and plot, from start to finish and without a single exception, is horrid.  Logical inconsistencies are everywhere, from stupid reasoning and decision making by main characters to a complete inability to explain obvious questions, ie. why the First Order doesn't simply send a couple ships a light speed ahead of where the fleeing "resistance" is heading and cut them off.  Then there is the tone, which is all over the place.  Forced, horrible humor cut in the middle of life and death situations.  Levity from characters like a dejected, defeated Luke that goes completely against what we are told his character has become.  COMPLETELY useless subplots that render certain characters pointless.  Finn, Rose, and to a large extent Leia might as well not even be in this movie.  Also, Rose is worse than Jar Jar.  I would rather watch an entire Jar Jar solo film than endure even another minute of Rose's horribly overacted, useless character. Also, they destroyed Luke.  Completely, utterly destroyed him.  He is a shell of his former self, making stupid jokes, not caring about anything, SHOWING A WILLINGNESS TO KILL HIS OWN NEPHEW JUST BECAUSE A LITTLE BIT OF DARKNESS WAS GROWING IN HIM.  Oh I'm sorry, he had an entire trilogy about forgiveness and seeing the good in even the darkest figures in the galaxy, i.e. Darth Vader, yet the boy he grew up with, the son of his sister and best friend, shows he has darkness in him and Luke, in some pathetic showing of weakness, considers ending his life.  Pathetic writing.  Pathetic story telling.  I would give this movie less than a zero if I could.  All of this is without mentioning Leia's superman/mary poppins act out in space, where she should have been burned, hit with debris, has the liquid freeze in her body, and have been deprived of oxygen for what looked like several minutes, despite having shown zero inclination of how to use the force at all previously besides little feelings here and there.  Oh, and Rey is just as much of an all powerful Jedi god again despite no training.  She can do no wrong.  She is an angel.  There are zero stakes at play for her, because she is perfect.  Oh, and then there's the bomber run at the beginning, where gravity apparently exists in space, and someone can be exposed to the vacuum of space and still breath.  There's Luke milking an elephant cow thing and drinking it's blue milk...just what in the actual f....  There's the forced political crap, like the Admiral's purple hair, the animal cruelty messages, the obvious diversity just to check boxes.  I am a liberal, but don't you dare infect star wars with political statements.  There's the Admiral herself, who is set up like a villain for LITERALLY NO REASON OTHER THAN THEY WANTED TO MAKE POE LOOK LIKE A FOOL.  Seriously, I challenge literally any fan of this movie to explain why the film did everything it could to portray her as a villain when in actuality she is self sacrificing and heroic, a close friend of Leia's.  Why she wouldn't give her plan to the only commander she has left.  If you can't trust the military leader of your remaining...what, 250 people?...then who CAN you trust?  So dumb.  Then there's Luke projecting himself across the galaxy - fine, you want to introduce new aspects of the force, I'm ok with that - only to have him DIE ANYWAYS?!?! WHAT WAS THE POINT OF HAVING HIM PROJECT THEN?!?! Just have him go there if you're going to kill him.  Have him fight, go out like a hero, take out a bunch of the First Order with him!  Oh, I'm sorry, you wanted to have him die while echoing the twin sun shot from A New Hope.  So you twist the plot around to make that happen, when the logic makes zero sense and it's just a "gotcha" moment for the audience.  So dumb.  Then there's Rey lifting the entire mountain of rocks when Luke couldn't lift the X-Wing after a bunch of training.  Wait, what about Rey's backstory being entirely pointless?  Even though YOU THE FRANCHISE built it up as some great secret?  In the same vein, how about building up who Snoke could possibly be, building up his all powerful command of the dark side, only for him to monologue like every other villain and for some reason not sense Kylo betraying him then dying without a shred of backstory or importance?  This movie did so many things wrong, spat in so many faces, that I refuse to see it as cannon.  It is a fanfic, a piece of imaginating from a politically motivated teenager.  It is pathetic in every way, insulting, ridiculous, funny for all the wrong reasons, and a disgrace to fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Avoided seeing this in theaters due to hearing about the death of luke.  Finally broke down and watched this and it was even worse than I expected.  This movie single handedly throws away everything about the star wars universe.  It destroys characters that were created and loved by many, all in the name of what?  So many pointless idiotic scenes.  So many poor attempts at humor that fall flat and are out of place.  The plot holes are laughable.  Sure star wars movies aren't rock solid in the plot department, but this one just throws that rule book out the window.  If this movies critical reviews aren't a sure sign that reviews are bought and paid for by disney then I don't know what is.  This is NOT the star wars movie you are looking for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Rose/Finn side-story was kind of annoying and didn't really fit into the movie.  Too much time was spent on their little trip.  Every character just seemed to be off in their own-subplot for most of the film, and a great lack of character development didn't help.  I never got emotionally invested in any of the characters.  Luke Skywalker was poorly written, and very contradictory to his strength in the original trilogy.  Kylo Ren continued to be a poor character, which is a shame as Adam Driver is a very good actor.  He is very conflicted between light and dark, and comes across as very weak, and changing his allegiance numerous times during the movie.  The scene with killing Snoke was also ridiculous, and Snoke didn't realize his anger was directed at him?  Too many themes were just rehashed from the original trilogy, and I was hoping that after The Force Awakens was a nostalgia trip they would have written this movie to be more of it's own, but still too much just copies the themes of the original trilogy.  It also went a little overboard with the kid-friendly nature, which begun with the prequels when Disney bought the rights.  The balance with humor and seriousness was much better in the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Overall, it was enjoyable, but die-hard Star Wars fans will be disappointed seeing their favorite characters so poorly written.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Ok, first things first: As a big, life long fan of all that is Star Wars, this movie makes me very conflicted. It is gorgeous. It has some of the finest sound editing, effects, and looks. The acting is good, and some of the action pieces are exciting and fun. Some of the jokes work. With that said, I'm really conflicted about the story; In an objective view, it is well done and written, but as a fan of the original expanded universe I really hate some of the choices and decisions they made. So how to rate it? As a lifelong fan, I would give it a mediocre or bad score, but I recognize that if I didn't know anything about the other story, I would probably love it. So trying to be as objective as I can, as a movie only it is well made, and is a fun time. That being said, I can see why is so polarizing to the fandom. Final verdict: 7.6</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Its visually spectacular and covers all the looks and sounds you expect from a Star Wars movie. However the story is a mix of uninspired and boring. Neither of which are even remotely good.<br/>Narrative-<br/>The narrative of this movie is the same as episode 5. Just as how episode 7 was like episode 4. A new Jedi goes to another planet to learn from a master to become stronger with the force, then they leave to go help their friends. That is the narrative of episode 5 and 8. If you spend a while looking into it you will only find more parallels. In fact the only significant change to narrative is the casino storyline, (which I won't spoil) which sucks. It tries to make you care about characters you just really don't and it amounts to nothing. This could be a normal length, not original but enjoyable still movie, however the casino just seems like they had to do something with John Boyega to remind you his character still existed. It is bad on that front. Visuals-<br/>This movie has my favourite visual aesthetics of a Star Wars movie to date. The planet, Crait, at the end is just awesome. Its like a huge salt flat with red dust under the surface, making a stunning visual filled with contrast of colours. Also the casino is very interesting looking, despite being useless.<br/>Audio-<br/>Its Star Wars audio. Its pretty cool.<br/><br/>To finish this review, I have to disclose that I'm not the biggest fan of the series. I have no investment into this series particularly like so many others do so thats why I can excuse some of the things like how they use Luke Skywalker as a character. However the story is just not good for a movie that should be this epic. In fact the only way I could tell that this movie was epic was from its visuals which were spectacular. However I still wouldn't go to see it again, or recommend it to non-fans of the series. It has positives but it is still a below average film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
