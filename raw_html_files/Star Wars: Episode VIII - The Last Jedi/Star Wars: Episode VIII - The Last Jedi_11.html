Yes many bombers were destroyed in the mission, more to chance than anything else, (one piece of enemy's ship debris hit one bomber that then causes a chain reaction of explosions that could not have been predicted), but when the mission was started the ideas was to send them non the less, they could have not known they were going to be destroyed, and if they knew, then why the hell would you send Poe to take down the surface canons from the Destroyer in the first place? There's also no reason to not tell Poe about the plans to leave the main Rebel ship as decoy, he's a high ranking officer, and he would not leak the plans to nobody, the only reason he ended up trying another plan was because he was not told what the plan was, that was a completely stupid way to handle your subordinates, telling them to shut up and do as she says? there's a time for a soldier to follow orders, and there is a time when following orders is just stupid, if the soldier knows the value of holding a position its more likely he would hold it because his morale will be high, Poe's morale was at an all time low, he was not only told he was an idiot for making the first plan successful, but also he was not told what the backup plan was, that made not god dam sense.<br/><br/>Finn should have died a hero's dead, and that's that, or if he was not to die, then that whole scene of him trying to kamikaze to stop the laser ramming ray should have been scrapped, It would have added gravitas and weight to the story if he actually was allowed to follow trough, but we can't have that, we need him to be our comic relief...in the next movie...<br/><br/>Luke could have been used much better, and his murdering tendencies toward Kylo made no sense in terms of Luke's psychology, Rey gets no training, which means the whole rest of Star War's ideas are effectively erased, and I would be fine with that, this review is not from a person that thinks Star Wars is the best of the best in terms of scifi, I rather watch Arrival or Interstellar for that matter, but if you are going to make the move to erase the older movies themes, then you could have done it in a way that made sense, for starters find a good reason for Kylo to be as deranged as he is, or was, the movie does not give us enough plot to believe Luke would decide to kill Kylo just like that, the motivations of the characters are paper thin. There's not enough plot, and what there is, is poorly thought out, so then the characters end up doing things because they are angry, or sad, or afraid, but the reasons are poorly explained, and thus the suspension of disbelieve is broken.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I went in with high expectations due to my love of Star Wars and because of my high confidence in Rian Johnson. I was left disappointed due to a weak plot and dragged out unnecessary storylines for Finn, Rose and Poe. Rose and Holdo were bad characters with weak dialogue and did not feel as if they fitted in with the rest of the film. I enjoyed Luke's storyline up until the end as I thought he would be given a chance to redeem himself. His death (or becoming one with the force) at the end left me very frustrated, as this was not a worthy ending for one of the most iconic characters in pop culture.<br/>However film wasn't all bad as the storylines and characterisations for both Rey and Kylo Ren were great. Kylo is quickly becoming what Anakin should have been in the prequels. Adam Driver's performance is incredible and he makes Kylo's struggle between the light and dark very genuine. Daisy Ridley also gives a good performance and helps develop Rey into a much more fleshed out character. Overall this film left me disappointed at Lucasfilm/Disney and Rian Johnson for their lack of respect for Luke Skywalker and to the classic Star Wars fans. However the film was not all terrible as it did expand on the two most important characters in the new trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I write that as a huge Star Wars fan, but also a someone who understands that the quality of Star Wars films tends the be iffy. The visuals, sound, and production design are all top notch. The pacing and story fit perfectly with the mechanics of the universe, but still subvert expectations. I truly believe this movie will be appreciated as time passes. So many people are upset that their beloved theories were wrong, and are ignoring all of the amazing things Rian Johnson does in this film.

However I am shocked at how disappointing this movie was! Snoke was nothing more than a plot device with zero payoff to who he is, Rey's parents end up being nothing, Luke's death at the end is totally "wat," and it basically made every male in the movie into either a blundering idiot or a villain while every female was righteous, smart and valorous... I'm all for equal male/female treatment but this was not equal at all. The story was filled with holes and totally broken. It had a few cool action sequences which were neat and some humor here and there but otherwise, a major disappointment. I would rate this one as being just as bad as Phantom Menace.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Grew up with the original SW trilogy throughout the 90s, rushed to watch Prequels in the 2000s. Played the video games, read the books and comics, watch the cartoons and animated series, and yes bought toys and merch.<br/><br/>So... about 2hr 30 min after, watching TLJ, I left the theater confused, (I understand why people had to watch TLJ 2 or 3 more times. And not in a good way). I slept it over. Woke up the next day. Thought about TLJ. Became more and more angry as I thought about TLJ. Slept again. Today, 2 days after watching TLJ = MORE ANGRY as I think about TLJ.<br/><br/>Critique of TLJ = Really weak story, plot holes after plot holes after plot holes, weak characters with little development (Sadness here - Rey, Fin, Poe deserved to shine in this episode...WASTED!), characters introduced who are inconsequential, storylines that go nowhere, forced SJW-3rd wave feminist messaging almost every other scene. (There has ALWAYS been strong men AND women in the sw universe but now only women are strong, smart, courageous, wise....okay....), forced out of place/oddly timed humour (Oh my god the phone joke!), brisk pacing for a 2hrs++ movie which remarkably lacks substance or depth ending up with heroes I am uninterested cheering for, villains that are not threatening. Then, how TLJ handled an iconic character which has been celebrated for pass a good 40 years....disrespectful.  Excellent visuals and music though, which seems to be what matters these days.<br/><br/>Ultimately you start to have the feeling that the director/writer of TLJ is giving you, star wars fans and the star wars mythos the middle finger all throughout the movie. Self indulgent, self satisfied, talentless hack. Who the f**k gave the greenlight for Rian Johnson to touch the star wars ip? People need to get fired for this. Thank god Rian Johnson was nowhere near Blade Runner 2049. As a fan of star wars for almost 30 years, literally almost all of my life (as of this writing), I'm done with star wars. I'm NOT EVEN INTERESTED IN EPISODE 9. WHO CARES? As an asian observer, if americans dont even care about their own cultural treasures then why should I? Star Wars is dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I wouldn't really care, except the way Rian Johnson made Luke Skywalker into the Larry David of Jedi Masters was ridiculous.  No way Luke ended up a grumpy old man just waiting around by himself doing nothing.  No way he disrespects the Skywalker light saber by throwing it over his shoulder.  No way he gets his ass kicked by Mary Sue Rey who is perfect in every way, but has no training whatsoever.  Think about how lame The Empire Strikes Back would have been if Luke already was the greatest warrior in the galaxy from the beginning and could kick Obi Wan's and Darth Vader's ass without having to go through the trials and events that eventually made him stronger, made him a Jedi.  I will never watch another Star Wars movie after this CF.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If you are a fan of Star Wars lore & charismatic main characters traversing a powerful story arc, Disney provides epic disappointment.  Rebellious heroics, compelling battle scenes, Luke, Yoda, Chewy, R2 & C3PO -all scrapped in this debasing of SW. The foundations of Jedi lore: master/apprentice traditions, humility, purpose, self development, virtue, loyalty -all cast aside. In the new SW one girl possesses all of these traits without having earned even one of them. And if you've had enough of compelling real locations, riveting light saber fights, & memorable side characters, then this is your ticket.  In this new SW universe a few strong women reprimand heroes & lead faceless 'rebels' into obliteration. Devoiding the audience of any care of outcome to characters, no established struggle is connected to us, so who really cares if they all die? The few intriguing characters are gone just as soon as we were drawn to them. Snoke, powerful Supreme leader, easily taken out by an errant saber. Benecio del ‘DJ' exhibiting Han Solo like charisma –all the better to banish him in a few quick scenes.  Luke went to all the trouble of projecting himself holographically (note: holographs can’t be killed) only to die from the labor of it. Poe, the one character exhibiting clear heroic struggle, was reduced to submissiveness for all his 'wrong moves', which turned out to be right after all. i.e. Had he gone in with fighters (which can also carry bombs) to blow up the Dreadnaught, instead of being sidelined for an undeveloped new (female) hero to do so much later, far fewer rebels would have been pointlessly killed. Instead of X-wing dogfights, we are dragged through the sleepy drama of large ships inching through space. The far superior New Order force is unable to overtake nor flank the Rebels –an excruciating plot device. This epic chase slogged us over an hour of nothingness. Suddenly we are transported to the 18th century suspense of a seagoing ship taking 3 days to driftingly overtake another. So let’s spare the further detail which will be suffered by those who still choose to see this film (code: bring a pillow & eye covers for act two). Yet we still have to get to the burning heart of the 4 mysteries we shared going into TLJ.<br/>1. What about Luke Skywalker? 2. Who are Rey’s parents? 3. Who is Snoke? 4. Will The Last Jedi use TFA as a springboard to broaden the SW universe?....1. Luke Skywalker, the heart of  the SW universe & all that we know him to be, is suddenly debased & expendable. The new Luke no longer believes in the Force. He is easily bested by a novice. To make matters worse, he betrays family-his nephew, Ben Solo, causing the storm to follow. This means that all his personal arc & the prophecy fulfillment (SW I-VI) of Luke bringing balance to the force, which he did with his father, is negated. Luke's most powerful trait, his belief in Good is also lost. SW VIII invalidates all of the greatest Star Wars' values & achievements by debasing the fundamentals of who Luke Skywalker is. Simply put, we should not have bothered to spend the previous 4 decades watching Star Wars & sharing the values in the Jedi allegories, lore & collections we all so treasure. It all means diddly now. Luke ends worse than he began.-And Yoda, evidently unimpressed that his teachings led Luke to save the galaxy years before, pops up for a few seconds to second the notion that it all has to burn.<br/>Luke’s three final accomplishments were to argue with a teenage girl as if he was still the same teenager we all met on long long ago on Tatooine, to lose belief in all that he earned through the Star Wars epics, & to die without just cause.<br/>2. Who are Rey’s parents? ‘These are not the parents we are looking for, move along.’ In a quick quip Kylo Ren invalidates all deeper interest, revealing that Rey’s parents were no-name deserters. So, no mystery to hold onto there. Unless… this is a clumsily written misdirection from a truth that would be deeper & the only logical possibility...In that this epic has no other Force lending fertile couples other than Leia & Han Solo, Rey IS Kylo Ren’s sister. For now, she is not. Her parents were nobodies.<br/>3. We finally get to see Snoke in the flesh. He is very impressive with powers not shown before in SW-the ability to mind bridge other force users to his own ends. His origin, why he is so powerful, his aims & other abilities- never to be known. Before we could develop a better understanding or compelling fear of him,  he allowed a carelessly placed lightsaber to be easily used to kill him.<br/>4. I went in to the first showing, open to the joys of suspended disbelief, & with the Force of will to like this Star Wars movie irregardless of any incongruities & the occasional Jar Jar. The only problem was, by any measure of that far far away galaxy, this was not a Star Wars movie. It's just Mickey's Revenge on the Jedi.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I had low expectations to begin with. The only reason I saw it in theaters was because I didn't want anything to be spoiled for me: Rey's origins/past/parents, Snoke's identity/past, and the Knights of Ren. It turns out that there was nothing to spoil. All of the questions from TFA were completely ignored. I immediately told my friends how disappointing this movie was in order to save them $15 and 2 1/2 hours of their lives. I felt it was my duty & responsibility to do so. I wish someone had done the same for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson packed it with a new story, drama, twists, jokes, exciting scenes, excitnig actors, and this is very good for this franchise.

Mark Hamill has said that he fundamentally disagreed with almost every decision Rian Johnson made for Luke's character and I've got to say that he's been very restrained in saying that because what's been done to the character of Luke Skywalker in this movie, is nothing short of cultural vandalism. Rian Johnson has made JJ Abrams look like Spielberg, it absolutely boggles the mind that Disney have given him a whole trilogy. You've got to wonder just what planet these Hollywood types are on. This most millennial of movies - preachy, shallow, self satisfied, lazy, boring and nowhere near as smart as it thinks it is - with a whole act that's completely pointless, is chock full of terribly out of place, cartoonish humour and laughably bad dialogue. Luke chose the island because it was "the most unfindable", I kid you not, he actually says that. He needn't have worried, I highly doubt this insulting hack job will be much sought after in the years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I had to do it, this movie was just so horrible.  Huge plot holes.  The director seems as if he has NEVER seen a Star Wars movie in his life.  He completely disregarded where Force Awakens left off.  The characters have ZERO character development.  Finn was pointless.  Leia turned into superman in space.  Luke Skywalker became a total wimp, getting a beat down by a girl with zero training whatsoever.  So much for Yoda's training.  This movie makes no sense.  They killed off a sith lord that you knew NOTHING about.  I found myself so detached from the characters.  The movie was painful.  Even the humor was not funny.  I want my money back.  The worst Star Wars movie of them all.  i was pretty shocked.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Instead of expanding the universe and focusing on the excellent characters JJ Abrams gave us in the previous film, Rian Johnson's movie becomes totally preoccupied with subverting expectation. It's cute at first when the film surprises you, but as the film went on I found myself asking, "but where is the movie?" I wanted more. I wanted an interesting universe and for the events of the previous film to have some kind of weight. I wanted the ridiculously charismatic John Boyega to have more to do than some throwaway B-plot that had no consequence on the story with a character nobody cares about (not Kelly Marie Tran's fault — she was as good as possible given the role). I wanted to know who Snoke was. I wanted to see Luke as more than a broken old man. I wanted to know who or what the Knights of Ren were.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie was the dynamic between Rey and Kylo. Everything else left me cold.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Snoke, for example, is just another pathetic, weak villain that serves as a mere plot point. Kylo Ren is pretty much the same that he was in the previous movie, except that he doesn't wear his mask anymore. Not to mention what they did to Luke. The lightsaber duels were also very basic and had no finesse to them. They looked like kids trying to hit each other with sticks. Apart from those flaws, I still enjoyed the movie. It's a good one if you go into it expecting lots of space action and enjoyed Force Awakens</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But for people, who lived with SW universe through original trilogy, books, video games etc... for them this movie could be a huge disappointment. Plot is a total mess with no logical connection even to this movie itself, not to mention all previous SW lore. Dull characters and side plots introduced in this movie just because "why not to add something that can be added". So far this is the worst movie of all 9 (episode 1-8 and including Rogue One) buy its plot and new characters. Comparing this movie to original trilogy is like comparing "Alien: Covenant" to original "Alien" and "Alients", or like comparing "Terminator: Salvation" to "Terminator 2"</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Absolutely poorly written and conceived. The characters are flat, weak, one-dimensional, and out-of-character. The structure is massively flawed and the plot is riddled with holes.<br/>I’ve seen every Star Wars movie in theater at least four times on top of countless viewings at home. I will never watch The Last Jedi again. It is hands down the worst in the franchise. I’m going to watch Attack of the Clones to cleanse my pallet…<br/>The filmmakers main goal across the board was to destroy and manipulate our expectations by breaking rules set in the Star Wars universe and by debunking every possible fan theory based on questions set up in The Force Awakens. If you want to play with audiences expectations do it in a standalone genre movie by playing with its genre conventions, not in an established canon. They pulled this “Tricked you / surprise card” so many times it was repulsive. Maybe try using two or three of your brilliant mind blowing disrespectful spins on fan expectations.<br/>I’ve never had such polarizing different opinions with critics as I do with this movie. I spent countless hours reading fan reviews and watching youtube reviews (positive and negative) and the problems that everyone has are consistent across the board. I’m having a hard time understanding why this would be the best critically reviewed Star Wars movie when I feel this is the worst produced… The filmmakers were more concerned with burning the past to build the future that they want. They don't care what the characters or story deserve and are trying to kill the Star Wars mythology.<br/>The original trilogy’s themes were hope, faith, loyalty, family and redemption. The Last Jedi dismantles that and it’s theme is “Let the past die, kill it if you have to.” and to disrespect everything that made Star Wars a universally beloved saga. Star Wars was about the eternal fight of light versus dark and finding the balance between the two. The Last Jedi is grey, bleak, and full of politically correct social propaganda being shoved down your throat in every other scene. Honestly this movie is subversive, divisive, and extremely hypocritical. Entertainment should be entertainment, don’t politicize our escape that actually bonds everyone no matter their age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, or religion.<br/>This movie intentionally tries to retroactively destroy everything we loved about the Star Wars movies that came before it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A Star Wars Movie that is fun to watch, that dares to take new directions in this old, old Galaxy! I understand all the hate this movie is getting as it basicly tells all the fanatics that they were wrong, that there is no God, that Luke is not a hero, he is a person, a broken one and that the Force is not exclusive to a specific bloodline or immaculate conception (Anakin). For me, I think of it as a new beginning for the franchise, the one where Skywalker dynasty is not in the center of entire Galaxy and the Galaxy, the real people, start to fight for their own. Plotholes? When You disagree with the direction You will find them everywhere this is not an issue here, as they were not an issue in Empire Strikes Back. I recommend everyone to watch this movie, You will not be dissapointed! I only hope that creators will not chicken out and will continue to - boldly go where no one has gone before ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Other than this 4 characters, every other character in the movie failed to demonstrate any sign of intelligence, regardless they are on the side of First Order or the Resistance.  General HUX and several other First Order officers had multiple easy opportunities to crush the rebellion, they would not take advantage on any of them.  While several attempts of escape by the Resistance were thwarted by, not the First Order, but other Resistance members.  Disney/Lucasfilms and director Rian Johnson want to move the franchise to a new direction, but failed to deliver a logical story on one of the two main lines of the plot.  Furthermore, they paid very little regard to the fact that this is second movie of a trilogy, and 8th of 9 movies chronicle.  "Let past dies,kill them if you have to" echos both inside the plot-line and out in the franchise's business direction.   What they did is surprising, but none truly is a "Shocker".  If they are bald enough to turn Rey to the dark side when Kylo offered alliance to her, I would respect that and be genuinely intrigued on the next movie.  But as it stands, I have not developed any emotional connection with Poe, Finn or Rose; nor any fear or hatred toward Hux.  Rey and Kylo is just the light-side girl tired to turn the dark-side boy and failed, so she will either try again or kill him in the final movie, that would not motivate me for Ep 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8037897"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">‘Star Wars The Last Jedi’ is quite possibly the most disappointing movie I have ever seen, not the worst, but the most disappointing. The previous movie, ‘The Force Awakens’, had plenty of problems and was essentially a rehashed and modernised version of ‘A New Hope’, but despite this I still left the cinema with that feeling of childlike excitement that usually goes along with seeing a Star Wars movie. With this movie, I left the cinema with a very different feeling.<br/><br/>There are so many issues with this movie that I doubt any review could cover them all without writing a lengthy tome on the subject, but the problem that stood out most obviously to me was the very poor script, not only in terms of dialogue but also with regard to story telling and basic continuity with previous entries in the series.<br/><br/>A Jedi Master contemplating murdering a child, fuel suddenly being a consideration in the SW universe, hyperspace ram-raiding, 2 fleets of ships that have EXACTLY the same maximum speed, WW2 style bombing runs in space with ships that are so hopelessly slow that even when they reach their target, they are too slow to escape from the blast of the bombs they just dropped, and a totally inconsistent timeline are just some of the many problems with this movie.<br/><br/>Besides the above issues, which many may consider’nitpicking’, there were other serious problems with this movie, such as character development......as in there wasn’t any. Rey is essentially the same character at the end of this movie as she was at the beginning, unless you count her seemingly magical ability to develop new skills instantly as character development. Kylo Ren was a whiney, bad tempered child in ‘The Force Awakens’, and he still is in this movie and Finn had basically the same character arc in this film as he did in the last one.<br/><br/>Poe Dameron is the only one of the new main characters to have any real development....and it was all bad, with him now having regressed from a seasoned and skilled pilot and leader in Episode VII to a short tempered and tactically inept moron in this movie.<br/><br/>The character I’m really looking forward to seeing them develop more in the future is Snoke because he was by far the best of the new.......oh, wait......he’s dead already.......never mind....<br/><br/>Of the other new characters, Vice Admiral Holdo is completely ineffectual as a leader and her actions actually cause more harm than good. Rose was as pointless a character as I have ever seen in a movie (and in fact the whole Canto Blight sub-plot was like something from a different movie and seems to have only been inserted to help push a political agenda) and DJ was......errrm......yeah.<br/><br/>Captain Phasma was also back in this instalment, but try not to blink after she appears on screen, because if you do she will be gone again.<br/><br/>The film criminally wasted the last (living at least) on screen appearance of Luke Skywalker, turned Leia into Mary Poppins and took 40 years of story and development and threw it all in the garbage in favour of a ‘bold new direction’, which was just Rian Johnson’s way of saying “If you are a long time Star Wars fan, tough cookies pal, Star Wars aint for you any more”<br/><br/>The only positive thing I can find to say about this movie is that at times it was visually stunning. Too long, too boring, disrespectful to the material and lore that preceded it and full of plot holes so large you could fit another movie in them, ‘The Last Jedi’ is absolutely NOT worth your time and it should have stayed in a galaxy far far away......</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Se ha hablado demasiado en la pelicula, no ha sido nada epico, ha habido cosas que no tienen sentido o se contradicen. Por ejemplo, un cañon de la estrella de la muerte en vez de cargarse al planeta entero hace un agujero super chico en la puerta; una nave super pequeña se carga a una super grande; luke skywalker ha estado entrenando con yoda durante dos pelis para ser jedi y aun no lo es, y rey entrenando en menos de 10 minutos ha levantado uma pedazo piedra y es jedi. Ademas, sobra 1 hora de peli. Gran parte de la peli es relleno.

However, from a storytelling and character perspective; SW was always lacking for me.<br/><br/>These same issues carried over to the J.J. Abrams-directed soft reboot The Force Awakens where despite grade-A action and visuals effects; suffered from an overly-formulaic plot that felt more like a glorified teaser for future movies than a real story. That and the Mary Sue protagonist, a disappointing villain in the form of Kylo Ren, and ANOTHER rehash of the Death Star plot.<br/><br/>I felt very divided as I was watching LJ. Rarely have I watched a movie where moments of sheer awesomeness are intermixed with moments that made me want to smack the upside of my head!<br/><br/>LJ carries over the tradition of the last two SW entries by being some of the most gorgeously executed special effects extravaganzas of the modern age.  I also really liked the sequences in which Rey is exploring the Force as well as her own emotional insecurities stemming from her uncertainty to her place in the universe.<br/><br/>I also liked how Johnson gives these sequences a slightly surreal and psychological portrayal, much like how it was in the original trilogy.<br/><br/>There were also admittedly plenty of laugh-out-loud moments throughout too, in fact, it maybe the funniest SW movie to date.<br/><br/>From a filmmaking and cinematography standpoint, SW has really never looked better!<br/><br/>It’s when we get into discussions about the actual plot and story that LJ causes major disturbances. Johnson is credited as the sole writer and I give him plenty of credit with being bold enough try new things with the Star Wars formula. Johnson is hardly a “safe” filmmaker like J.J. Abrams.<br/><br/>The storyline involving Rey, Luke, and Ren is by far the most interesting stuff.<br/><br/>Luke’s character is taken in a very unexpected direction and Mark Hamill is more than capable of pulling off a more weary, vulnerable, and morally-greyed version of the iconic space hero. Rey still remains over-powered but she did feel less like a Mary Sue this time around due to the focus on her emotional insecurities. That and the fascinating new layer given to the dynamic between Rey and Ren.<br/><br/>Speaking of Ren, I’ve always liked Adam Driver and it was nice to see him being given better material to work with this time around. If Johnson succeeded at anything, it was turning Ren from a overgrown pathetic whiny brat to the complicated lost soul that FA attempted to portray him as but failed. If anything Ren is by far the best character now because he is the only one that goes through any real arc in LJ outside of Luke.<br/><br/>Because outside of the Rey, Luke and Ren storyline; everything else about the plot is an under explained and baffling mess with so-many questionable creative choices.<br/><br/>Like with Alien Covenant, if you are hoping for any answers to the questions posed by FA, then you are going to be severely disappointed.<br/><br/>Instead of being given more backstory that would help contextualize the drama and make us more invested in the plot; signifiant time is wasted following Finn (Boyega) and Rose Tico (Tran) on a planet straight from The Fifth Element in search of a codebreaker that I swear was ENTIRELY POINTLESS!!!<br/><br/>Who is Rose Tico?<br/><br/>Probably the most blatant example of adding an unnecessary character to a movie in a predictable attempt to appeal to Asian markets since Angelababy from Independence Day: Resurgence. It also doesn’t help that Tran is given some of the worst dialogue in the movie.<br/><br/>The First Order also continues it’s tradition of being the most incompetent evil oppressive empire since…well…the Empire. The Resistance also showcases baffling levels of incompetence. While I really enjoy Poe as a character due to Isaac’s effortlessly charismatic portrayal, his continuous unruly attitude and disregard for chain of command severely makes you question the quality of Leia’s judgement.<br/><br/>Laura Dern also randomly shows up in the movie as a supposed “legendary” Resistance leader although with that stupid purple wig she looks more like a hipster college professor if anything. I love Dern but she was simply wasted in this despite having one admittedly awesome scene, a literal non-character.<br/><br/>It’s not like I didn’t have some fun watching LJ, heck I think it is a slight step above FA, but I simply can’t ignore the questionable script on display. I personally can’t understand how anybody, critics or otherwise, can watch this and FA and tell me with a straight face they are examples of quality writing.<br/><br/>It’s far from the worst Star Wars movie, that honor goes to Attack of the Clones and it’s “worse than Twilight” chemistry-free love story between Anakin Skywalker and Padme, but it’s certainly not one of the best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Its overloaded with action scenes, that while admittedly very pretty, leave little time for character development among the new cast. I expected and accepted that as never ending action seems to be a hallmark of all things high budget and Hollywood these days but certainly the most egregious trait this film has in common with the marvel franchise is the low brow, for lack of a better word stupid, humor that does not fit with the film and really breaks the 4th wall in its absurdity. that, the overall plot direction, and some out of place cutesy little alien critters that I'm sure Disney is producing in plush doll form by the millions as we speak, sums up my complaints. Apart from all that it has some truly surprising twists and we get to see Mark Hamil again, so although I have my complaints and completely dislike the direction this new series has gone I would say its worth a watch, and I do mean a "watch" singular. A second viewing or buying of the movie? certainly not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8035668"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi, took a bold new direction with many story elements. This was sometimes to it's detriment. Most (if not all) of the story beats that it's predecessor, The Force Awakens, set-up were quickly discarded (Rey's parents being important, Snoke's backstory being integral to the plot, etc). It seems that the intention of these subverted expectations was to tell the audience to forget what they think should happen: don't idolize Luke Skywalker, the force isn't only strong in the Skywalker line. To this effect, I enjoyed how The Last Jedi took old characters whom we love (Han, Luke, and Leia) and told us to let go of what we believe to be true and to make way for the new. I very much enjoyed Luke's wisdom of the force belonging to everyone, not just the Jedi (or the Skywalkers). The trope just seemed overplayed. It was pounded into the viewer's head over and over. "Oh you think this is going to go a certain way? Think again! It's the complete opposite. The Jedi texts don't matter. Luke's father's lightsaber doesn't matter. The subplot on Canto Bight doesn't matter." It all feels like a big troll on the audience. The use of subverted expectations is fine until it gets old. You mean Luke would have no emotional attachment whatsoever to his father's old lightsaber that he lost back in Episode V? It's a hard pill to swallow and the movie doesn't try to help the audience digest it. The worst case of this is the subplot of Finn and Rose and their mission to find a master code-breaker. Not only does the whole Canto Bight scene grind the film to a slog, but the audience is forced to muddle through it just to have the mission end in failure. Moments like these could be handled with more grace instead of leaving the viewer feeling as if the last 45 minutes of the film was wasted time. I did enjoy Poe's story. He was more fleshed out as a character and he was the driving force behind why I cared about what happened to the rebels. (And Leia of course.) I also enjoyed a lot of the things that went contrary to what I expected. I enjoyed seeing the dialogue between Rey and Kylo and how they both were seduced to the "other" side. I liked the fact that Kylo wanted to chart his own path free from past structure, but incidentally falling right into it. I enjoyed the darker themes of the movie over all and the glimmer of hope the audience is left with at the end. This movie is a mixed bag for me. A lot of things didn't work (Finn and Rose aren't being shipped any time soon). It was a fun movie and the over-all point was hit, but the execution was sloppy. This is a fine Star Wars movie, but ranks somewhere in the middle.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8036393"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">So what do I think of the newest Star Wars adventure?<br/><br/>Fun to watch, but not great overall. And definitely the worst the Star Wars product Disney has put out so far.<br/><br/>The biggest problems with the movie can be divided into 2 categories: movie filler and character mismanagement.<br/><br/>The first major problems with the Last Jedi are pretty much universally agreed upon and there are few defenders.Trying to sit and watch this film makes the problem very clear. Seriously, there is at least 1 hour of useless plodding that contributes almost nothing to the movie.There is a good movie somewhere in all this footage. However you will have to sit 2 and 1/2 hours to see it.<br/><br/>And if you think that is bad you should see how it treats the original trilogy characters. The sin of legacy character mismanagement and just poor character writing is much more bothersome to me and other long time fans.<br/><br/>Luke, Leia, and even Chewbacca are poorly written and untrue to their portrayals in the original trilogy of Star Wars movies. This not only hurts the interest of fans in this movie but how people will now look at the Star Wars franchise as a whole. And Despite what the Holly-Wood writers say, the character portrayals aren't just fan complaints that need to be blown off. I imagine the long term financial prospects of The Last Jedi are hurt by this corporate decision making.<br/><br/>Luke is a weakly sarcastic humdrum Ebeneezer type character that is almost 180 degrees of difference in philosophy and morality. His backstory plot and his decision making for most of the film is very un-Luke Skywalker like. Yes there is a cool moment at the end of the film, but even here The Last Jedi disappoints. The one time that we actually get to see Luke get off his couch, take a shower, and actually help turns out to be a nothing but a mirage.<br/><br/>Spoilers,he literally turns out to be a mirage.<br/><br/>There are powerful moments for Mark Hamill to strut his acing ability, and there this film doesn't disappoint.Hamill has for decades proven himself one of them most capable actors in venues like dubbing animation, and audio plays. It is nice to see he gets a chance to shine.<br/><br/>However, we don't get the same opportunity to watch the usually funny and powerful late actress Carrie Fisher. Here Leia is indecisive, quiet and plays little into the decision making of the resistance when she does manage to speak. It is obvious that the footage they did get of the late awesome actress was much less than the PR Disney wanted us to believe. And this movie is all the poorer for it.<br/><br/>To make up for this, a new actress is cast to play the lines Fisher couldn't and it doesn't help much. The Purple Haired general is probably the most forgettable character for the amount of screen time given in this movie. A weak sub-plot involving her and the character Poe is not only boring, but nonsensical and riddled with plot holes. Even the great sacrifice this character makes is hard to watch and does little to redeem her.<br/><br/>I hope dear reader you noticed that I haven't yet nodded to the extremely strange and disbelief killing parts of this movie. In particular,the scene where we actually get to see Leia use the force turns out to be this weirdly whimsical resurrection in the style of Marry Poppins. Plus the time Luke milks an alien walrus, or Yoda helps Luke in a book burning. The last of which bothers me more than probably anything else.<br/><br/>No way in ewok hell would Yoda ever try to destroy the legacy of the Jedi nor authorize book burning of any kind. But this is exactly the thematic message that Star Wars know wants us to understand.<br/><br/>To quote Kylo Ren: "Let the past die. Kill it if you have to". Isn't that the same message that fascistic nations and dictators want their citizens to believe. If Hitler was in the theater I could imagine him giving a thumbs up.<br/><br/>I doubt I'll be able to sit-down and happily watch this film again in the same way I do for all of the other films. This movie really has damaged my love for the Star Wars franchise. The prequels which I overall enjoyed and often made fun of; never spat upon the legacy and beloved characters of the original trilogy. Jar Jar never took away from the dynamic story and character that is Luke Skywalker. This movie does, and does it with pride.<br/><br/>Yet I still recommend most people to go see Star Wars: The Last Jedi. It is a visually stunning film, and the Rey/Kylo Ren storyline is entertaining and thought provoking; even if it concludes with the wrong sentiment. Just be prepared to wait 2 1/2 hours to see it, and know coming in that you will hate what they do to the old Star Wars crew.<br/><br/>If you can stomach all that the let the Force be with you. (as if I could of ended with anything else ;0)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But as a Star Wars film, it leaves you with very little to look forward to in Episode 9, offering some extremely disappointing answers to questions raised in last movie, while seemingly also throwing much of what is considered sacred among Star Wars fans out the window.<br/><br/>It should be noted that my only real criticism of TFA was that it didn't offer anything new. TLJ is the exact opposite of that, taking many (perhaps too many) new risks with the story. Unfortunately, few of said risks panned out well in the end. Most notably, the way Rian Johnson treated the character of Luke Skywalker has left an extremely sour taste in my mouth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Never before I felt this way while watching an entry of my favorite movie saga ever. Up to that point I was mildly entertained - lots of eye-candy - but the over-the-top humor and a growing length that for some reason wasn't paying off were already red flags. When the credits rolled I was confused out of my mind.<br/><br/>Since then I don't go a day without thinking how bad the whole experience was, and I just had to come over and join the almost three-thousand voters' consensus.<br/><br/>One could point three main reasons why The Last Jedi is atrocious: 1) It's technically an awful movie: bad writing, bad pacing, bad acting, bad dialogue, bad decisions, gaping plot holes, no character development, no real journey, no accomplishments, disjointed plot; 2) It actually strives to spend the maximum screentime as possible delivering political undertones that have nothing to do with it's universe at all; and 3) shamelessly disrespects and disregards the saga's lore, world-building and legendary characters.<br/><br/>I never thought it would come to this, since The Force Awakens was a serviceable nostalgia ride and Disney usually manages to keep the quality standards in their projects. But it's not just about nostalgia, as most of the critics are bashing the disheartened fans. The changes they defend about The Last Jedi are not thoughtful steps forwards that build on the saga's foundation. They're market-calculated decisions designed to appeal a smartphone-dumbed and twitter-minded younger audience, coupled with really shallow and trendy moviemaking. And to that merit, Episode VIII accomplishes it infamously.<br/><br/>Also, that is where The Last Jedi does feel like closure, at least to me. I'm disgusted enough to have paid a cinema ticket to watch it, and I'll not indulge this Coca-Cola-ish brand anymore. I'm not part of the target audience that enjoyed this catastrophe and is willing to pay for more. I've lost interest in many other beloved franchises before, but never felt so conned and so betrayed like this. As time passes though, comes indifference, and I just can't be bothered. Like many others have expressed, I've no more room for Star Wars in my entertainment, be it past or upcoming features. An X-Wing replica still sits on my desk, but it feels strangely distant now. The Last Jedi is a bitter full circle, and I'm done with Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Every Star Wars film, including the prequels, has had moments that gave me goosebumps, the feeling I would always use to measure how a film made me feel.  I had no such goosebump moment in The Last Jedi.  The best word I can use to describe my experience is contempt.  From very near the start of the movie, I felt an ever deepening pit forming in the bottom of my stomach.  So much life is wasted in this film, heroic moments are ruined by modern sounding one liners or gestures.  Luke might as well have dabbed in that scene near the end when the director wanted him to look like a badass.  Why has the technology of Star Wars degraded so much and become so inconsistent?  Sure, the sound and visuals were great, and the music was awesome as always thanks to John Williams, but most movies look and sound great today so that is no longer the mark of a good film.  This film has no heart, no soul, or care for what came before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Virtually nothing in the film felt like it could be taken seriously.  If you wanted a Star Wars film where every character plays an alter ego of Jar Jar Binks, this is the film for you.<br/><br/>The plot and plot holes are terrible also, the First Order continues to get its ass kicked in every encounter, yet we are told to believe that hope is near lost because of 'reasons'.  With no sense of plot, the entire story lacks any weight, and in the end, events that were supposed to be critical to the film ultimately felt very cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I can see someone say it was ok but the bad moments in this movie were BAD. I'm not at all against going in a new direction i just wish they would have kept Luke out of it lol. I think this new Luke takes away from OG Luke. That super powerful moment when when we last see Luke in ROTJ where he throws down his saber and essentially his life when he tells the emperor that he's lost "I'm a jedi like my father before me". I guess it would be ok to take Lukes story where they did but that deserves a 3 Movie arc of its own not a 3 act arc. Thats one of my biggest issues with this movie. Luke has been ROTJ Luke in everyones mines for the last 30 some years to just take his character in a new direction in 3 acts is shameful to me. Also please don't put it on fans when the Force Awakens leaves off with this super emotional moment where Rey hands the saber to Luke, the look on looks face the emotion and tension in both of their eyes, a shot that seemed to linger on for 30 secs or so when we circled the characters to just end that scene an that tone that was set with a joke is just terrible.﻿ Luke not being true to his character, Luke milking a sea cow, Leia flying though space and the entire Finn storyline was enough to kill anything they might have done well for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Ok the Force Awakens might have just rehashed the Episode 4 story but it put the fun and adventure back into series and gloriously built up to the moment where The Last Jedi begins... Oh ok the start of the movie was crap. The middle of the movie was crap and yep the end of the movie was crap too, for all the reasons the other audience reviews have mentioned over and over. I so wanted to like this movie but it's crap - total crap with exception of the mighty fine visual effects.

The action is great, in the ships or with the lightsabers, it all get you pumped.<br/>The problem here is the way they got Luke going, some decisions made doesn't seem the same character as we know.<br/>The story line is very good, with a few unnecessary scenes, but it does get you curious for what's coming next in the franchise, it's completely impossible to be sure of anything, which is great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They have all the top military technology and giant ships and loads and loads of soldiers (which is never explained how they got all that stuff in the first place), yet they **** up the most basic logistical tasks and keep getting beaten by 20 people in outdated junk tech<br/>-Leia get's blown up into space in an actually epic scene that would have been a great opportunity to kill off her character since the actress died. But nope, she suddenly has op force powers that help her survive in space and she just floats to the starship door like Marry Poppins<br/>-Admiral Ackbar is killed offscreen to make room for a forced feminist violet-haired character to be in charge (which might be why they had to come up with something to knock out Leia in the first place) who just plays games with Poe to show how she's a strong independent woman even if that ends up killing half the Resistance because she was too proud to tell her plan to anyone<br/>-Forced Casino side-plot with yet another forced feminist character where they search for a "master hacker" while criticizing capitalism and animal abuse just to find some random drunk in a cell who just happens to also be a master hacker after being told the other master hacker is the only one who can do it. Then they get betrayed by the drunk master hacker so the whole side plot ends up being useless anyway.<br/>-The rest of the resistance uses junk-gliders to take on like 20 top tier AT-ATs because they need to destroy a giant laser-cannon but most of them get blown up on the way. Finn tries to sacrifice himself which would actually have been a great moment and would have made it feel like there's actual consequence in the movie, but in one of the most stupid moments in movie history the random girl crashes into Finn and basically (almost) sacrifices herself for saving Finn from saving the resistance and then proceeds to kiss him after knowing him for like 8 hours.<br/>-Finn is just able to drag the random girl for miles and miles to the base without any protection without being shot<br/>-Luke appears and gives the movie an epic final showdown with Kylo Ren, which would have made a somewhat worthy death for him, sacrificing himself, but then reveals he just trolled everyone with a hologram. But then he just dies anyway from a heart attack or whatever so what was the point of not personally showing up...<br/>-Once again incompetent First Order can't notice the Millenium Falcon escaping<br/><br/>I definitely won't pay any money for the 9th movie and deeply regret paying money for this garbage. Don't understand why so many people are giving such high ratings (especially all the critics)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are some scenes that had me thinking 'Really?' But I was prepared to forgive them because had they made The Same Film Again (Eps 4 / 6 / 7), that would have been it for me. The franchise desperately needed some defibrillation, even at the expense of a broken rib or two, and it got it. Admire it for its bravery, if nothing else. Visually brilliant, not just in the usual sense but in the choice of colour palettes. The IMAX version I saw sounded amazing, too (and the 3D was a pleasant enhancement, not an annoying gimmick). This is not the best film ever made. It's not even the best Star Wars film. But it does give the series a much-needed kick up the a**e, which of course will annoy the crap out of those who get cross that it wasn't the film they wanted to see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There is no bad guy in this movie, Kylo Ren loses again all of his fights and Rey win them all anyone knows why (because they wanted to create a strong and independent female character). They changed Ren's scar because he was ugly with it and removes his helmet at the beginning losing all the strenght the character had with it. He kills his father and doesn't even have dark side eyes? WTF?? Honestly I'd love a female character like Ripley, Sanchez, Imperator Furiosa etc... but no... she doesn't need training or anything else, thats just for male jedi. What about Snoke (lol), Finn, Phasma (lol), Ren Knights, Leia(LOL), R2D2, Chewie etc? Forget them, they wasted. At the end of TESB you cared for absolutely every character, bad one or not, you knew them and watched them evolve and grow. It doesnt happen here, everything is at the same point but filled with many marvel and out of place jokes and new creatures just for merchandising.<br/><br/>Why there is a role for that asian woman? It is ABSOLUTELY unnecessary, but hey, you make a black guy kiss an asian woman and everything is beautiful even if their actions were unnecessary. You can call me racist or another **** like that, and you will be wrong, I dont have any problem with the ethnic of anyone in ANY situation, I only care for his/her act and role, and honestly, her character was forced in order to represent a beautiful and multicultural society (just with the resistance, the bad guys are all of them white males, of course)<br/><br/>My english is bad and I cant explain as I would want, just watch it and judge yourself, but please, dont give your hard owned money to the empire and his minions, even if you find 20 bucks on the floor, they dont deserve it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I left the theater asking what it was I just watched. It was a pretty movie with nice effects and to some degree it keeps you on your toes about what will happen in the plot... but this is not Star Wars! Take the casino planet which most everyone hates, it looks like Las Vegas. Star Wars has, for the most part, been able to create a rich and exciting galaxy that feels foreign and new. This movie hit way to close to home for more reasons more than one. I don't care for what happened to Luke and all the side stories. This movie was made by a cinematographer, not a story teller.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Last Jedi is an introduction to it's future. The Luke an Rey dynamic serves as smart-alecky way of outright bashing the perceptions and expectations fans have for what a Star Wars fan can be. Sometimes to the point of even spitting in our faces and quite frankly it's just what we needed. The movie defies expectations in several areas. You can still predict certain outcomes, but The Last Jedi has plenty of surprises in store.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are spectacular, the emotion is high, and the way it makes us question our heroes and our villains is exemplary. It's Star Wars film with some balls. The cinematography is nothing short of stunning. Adding a sense of beauty to those tense standoffs and set-pieces. The humor... is a bit much at first. Honestly, the way the film starts off with ridiculous humor taking center stage and a ridiculous scenario, it feels like a parody of a Star Wars film at first. It manages to find it's way before too long and the self-awareness and jokes get more comfortably integrated. Not before throwing some shade at The Force Awakens though.<br/><br/>It's a Star Wars film with some balls. It doesn't always deviate from the expected, leaves us with some unanswered questions, and gets off to a rough start. The humor can also clash with everything else happening onscreen rather garishly at times. Yet, there are still plenty of shocking moments, spectacular action scenes, a lot of heart, and some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen in a movie. It pays tribute to the past while carving it's own path to the future. It's handling of the original Star Wars heroes is touching. One of the best films in the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Nothing makes sense. What the heck with Leia flying? That is so stupid. Mary Moppins! So stupid. That's not how the force works!!!!! She should have been jumping around doing spin moves and back-flips with twin lightsabers and telling the first order that she has the high ground, after all she was flying!! That would show us just how powerful she is in the force. I mean it has been 30 years!! She can do better than just flying through space... Oh and don't get me started on how wasted Snoke was. He is supposed to be the most powerful bad guy in the galaxy remember? If you read the Snoke comic book you should know. After all if you didn't you are not a true Star Wars fan. And Phasma! what a chrome dome! wasted again. She was so cool and stupid Ruin Johnson ruined her!!!!!! It was completely normal for her to appear out of nowhere in episode 8 after her apparent death in 7 because if you read the Phasma comic book volume 938, which was a real page turner, if you are a true fan then you would have read the 87 page explanation starting on page 851 of how she survived by boarding Snoke's ship on a tie interceptor with the aid of DJ. To make matters worse, Rose and Haldo were basically shoehorned in just so there are more women with one being Asian and one with purple hair. Literally, they serve no purpose to the story. If anyone with half a brain who gave this movie a good review like the paid critics and Disney bottom feeders were even paying attention during this 2 and a half hour movie which was basically a literal recording of a slow ass space chase devoid of anything else, not even at least a scene where they explain why the chase was even happening in the first place, they would have seen that Haldo basically did zero things. Why didn't she just tell Poe her plan?!!!! This SJW purple haired lady didn't trust Poe because he made a little mistake in the beginning of the movie? Give me a break!!! Doesn't she know that Poe blew up Starkiller Base single-handedly with literally no assistance from anyone else?!!!! Seriously, because he did in case you didn't know. Since she didn't tell Poe of her plan for some SJW reason, it forced Poe to make another mistake by making him think it was a good idea to send Finn and Rose via Maz Kanatas skype message to Canto Bight which was first of all insanely risky, vaguely even plausible, and entirely boring and pointless!! Poe's leadership arc was completely ruined by Haldo. It wasn't his fault for sending Finn and Rose on a pointless and risky mission because he had no choice, therefore it was Holdo's fault. The plan could have been better thought out but he had no time to think, because SJW lady should have just told Poe and let him lead the Resistance because he clearly has better judgment!!!!!!!! Rose seriously should have just killed herself. Why the crap was she in this movie? She did nothing. She went to save the horses? Really??? She made Finn soft by making him think about animal abuse. Those animals were too CGI and lame, should have just let them die. Why would Rose even think about saving them? She's isn't even related to them. Bad character writing.. Finn, saved by Rose? Why would she save him? She clearly hates him if you weren't paying attention!!!!! What the crap am I watching? This movie makes no sense. It has no heart. Characters making choices left and right that are literally the opposites of what they should be doing!!!! There's no sense!!! Why in the hell didn't Rey join Kylo? Up until everything I have been watching, it was made so clear that Rey was turning evil and forgetting about the Resistance.. And then when Kylo asks her to abandon the Resistance and her friends and join him she says no? WTF????????!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lastly how dare they ruin my husband Luke Skywalker's legacy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In respect to true Star Wars Luke, he would never have even thought about hurting Ben. He would have tried to teach him to become good. No, actually he wouldn't even have believed that his vision of Ben being evil was real, because based on the original trilogy, Luke wasn't capable of thinking evil thoughts or having evil thoughts, let alone evil visions about other people. He was always thoughtful, charismatic, optimistic, and believed everyone was good. Logically, or should I say, if Luke was written according to his true character, Ben should have killed Luke right then and there in the hut because Luke wouldn't have had any idea Ben was bad in the first place. So out of character!!!! Oh yeah Rey is the ultimate Mary Sue!!!!!! She didn't even train with Luke! It's almost as if she has some raw strength that can't be explained and they didn't even at least tell us that!! Lazy writing............. 0/10 #BringGeorgeBack</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Kill it if you have to". These words, spoken by Kylo, undoubtfuly relate to the Star Wars saga after 2015 and the premiere of TFA. The saga is in agony. It kills the heroes of old you once related to. It will kill anything you held dear about the old movies. And you, dear viewer, should kill any hope you may still have for the SW tale to continue in a right direction taking into account that the last episode of the newest trilogy will be in the hands of Jar Jar Abrams (who started this mess), and the entire consecutive trilogy spawned in the sick mind of RJ - creator of the latest film - TLJ.<br/>TFA, longly awaited, twisted the galaxy far far away that we knew. It was a calque of ANH gone wrong. I have posted my review of it 2 years ago, so will not go into detail about that movie. The only thing left when I went out of the cinema (did not buy the BR/DVD to see - not worth the money and my time) was hope. Hope for the next episode to set things right. To create new characters who you may relate to. To create the new EU (the old one Disney crossed out when buying the franchise). RO launched in the meantime and it fueled that ray of hope that things are heading in the right direction for the saga as well. But that hope unfortunately was hacked to pieces by a machete with the premiere of TLJ.<br/>The movie continues to dismantle the universe once so beloved by me. It also raises questions. Why Disney, having basically unlimited resources, hires a guy whose only achievement is a mediocre movie to continue with the greatest saga of all time? Who is overlooking this entire project, as there is clearly no proper management over the creative aspects. In the previous trilogies each episode had some consistency in the storyline. Now the viewer (at least me) is left confused. New characters are created just to kill them off/abandon in the next movie? A cliffhanger at the end of TFA (as weak as the film was) leaves us with great expectations- meanwhile it's blown off after 10 minutes of the next film with Luke throwing his sword away and milking the sea-cow (example of hideous "humor")? Why have more sensible ideas been crossed out from the EU, substituted by ridiculous ones which now are "cannon"? Examples: 1) bombers in space, slow as hell, dropping bombs with the force of gravity? Even in the previous movies there were B-wings shooting torpedoes- which makes more sense than having to get so close to the enemy warship; 2) hyperspacing (although hyperspace "logic" was already tampered with in TFA) into enemy ships- why did they not think of it in all the previous movies?! It would have saved millions of lives (Death Star 1 destroying Alderaan; Starkiller destroying even more worlds)! Oh- probably because a woman wasn't in charge of the Rebel fleet then- that would explain it. Retarted men could not have thought of such a simple solution. But why does Haldo sacrifice herself and the command ship instead of just hyping all of the transports (flown by droids) into First Order ships..? There's tons of similar stupidities in the plot mentioned by other reviewers, but the last one I mentioned takes us to the feminist "touch" to the New Star Wars, which is unbearable. I understand the SW universe was dominated by men (because they're sci-fi's "target"?), and there must now be a "par" that we let women in 50/50. But why must their characters be so flat? There were plenty of strong females in the EU: Leia, Mara Jade, the commander of the test Death Star etc. They had "balls" and were memorable. Why did the screenplay writer now lower the standard so much? Didn't he notice this creates a caricature? Even hearing Leia now makes me wanna puke because of the things they make her say (did not happen in the OT). The worst though is the Asian chick - every time she said something it literaliry made me make a facepalm in the cinema. Especially her last words ("make love not war"). I really hope this character does not survive (she was wounded)... She's just meaningless (as 1/3rd of the move with the subplot she's in). Contrary to the women, men are plain stupid ("salt!"), hot-heads (Poe; although admiral Holdo seems to be into that type of men from time to time- as she states) or cowards (Fin wanting to escape; Luke- who is a travesty of himself from the old days and the old EU). Also Kathleen Kennedy making her campaign "the Force is female". WTF?! At least we know who's forcing this crap and who should go to make things better.<br/>There's far more idiocies to describe, but I must end here, as the review's limited to 5k characters.<br/>The thing I have to add at the end: I was a life-long fan of SW (since like 3). I have a 1yo son now and I am ashamed I have bought him SW clothes/gadgets and wanted him to follow my footsteps in embracing the SW universe. I will have to burn all that now, just just like Yoda did to the sacred Jedi scrolls. Let the past die. Let SW die. Shame. Not into SW saga anymore- don't honestly care.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A 2 and a half hour movie filled with little action sequences and no exciting light saber battles. They took a 30 year story and destroyed it with 1 movie. The visuals were very good however and it was a gorgeous movie to look at. The characters and their story lines were very underwhelming, even characters that I really enjoyed in the Force Awakens (Finn) disappointing me in this one. Movie could have been 30 minutes shorter with many, many unneeded scenes that had no business being in the movie. A lot of forced jokes that sometimes worked but usually didn't. The last 30 minutes of the movie was the best part in my opinion, had some memorable moments and finally a cool fight sequence. Overall a very disappointing movie after Force Awakens and Rogue One were both so good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Fundamentally it is just a mess of a story and takes easy ways out and destroys iconic characters from the originals. I really wanted to love this film.. but I feel nothing but betrayal and disgust. As a man, I felt personally insulted by all the feminist messages. If I want to be told how stupid, incompetent, reckless, weak, cowardly, farcical men are, I'd stayed at home or at work.

The critics really goofed on this one. I hope they got paid well by Disney to give such undeserved praise to mediocrity. The second the Chinese actress in the beginning began to make her hero moves, I knew the user reviews were accurate. I'll be brief. The editing and screenwriting at times was so ridiculous, it was entertaining. And why did they have to force a romance at the end? Even those two characters didn't fancy each other.  Sound design, CGI, and cinematography was above average. The plot was just enough to carry a major film, but the execution made the story feel like a run-of-the-mill sci-fi show from 2006. Everything kept getting worse and worse, you wonder what is taking so long. Leia's ex-machina moment was gracefully executed, but feel contrived. A friend told me that the editing for Luke at the end of the film could have lingered for effect, and I think he's right. They had wonderful opportunities to reflect, and they failed to take advantage.<br/><br/>Verdict: If you're a film geek (who is not a stubborn Star Wars fan) looking for a laugh, see this movie. If you want a new space opera worth your time, see Rogue One on Netflix.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I don't understand those who hate this movie so much, yet loved the Force Awakens.  The Force Awakens was basically A New Hope, reimagined, as The Last Jedi is basically The Empire Strikes Back, reimagined.  I found Luke's personality change interesting.  His conflicted darker self was talked about in SW 4, 5 & 6, but he pretty much remained a consistent Mary Sunshine throughout that trilogy, his biggest offense being cursed with self-doubt.  As much as I love endless optimism, it's nice to have some added character dimension on display, and see that our heroes can be flawed.  Overall, I see this and The Force Awakens as a balancing act of trying to respectfully close out the story lines of the original Star Wars players and passing the story on to the next generation, and I think they did a good job.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

For the most part, the acting was very good, and even great at times. Unfortunately, the script was a complete train wreck. It had so many plot holes and felt so contrived. Huge sections of the story didn't make any sense, couldn't the First Order just hyperspace in a ship in front of the Resistance? nobody in the First Order thought of that? And what's up with those resistance bombers? It's like they were designed to be the least effective military vehicle (even ignoring the whole gravity issue with the bombs). Basically they're weak, slow have to be so close to their target that when they deploy their bombs they're guaranteed to get blown up in the blast... Sign me up! Torpedoes did exist, much more practical. Oh and if we get into the whole hyperspace Kamakazi trick then all of these are essentially pointless anyways. Just make fleets piloted by droids to hyperspace into stuff. Problem solved. It's not that my expectations were cleverly overturned, it's that I expected the characters to behave like rational people (or irrationally in an internally-consistent manner), and the script subverts those expectations, not by being clever or throwing in some brilliant twists, but by having the characters do stuff that makes no sense at all. That's not "fresh or subversive," that's just inconsistent, sloppy and disrespectful to the characters and the universe in general.<br/><br/>Admiral purple hair was an especially worthless character. She added nothing to the story and didn't grow in any meaningful way. Rose was also awful. Maybe her character could have been salvaged if they had replaced the stupid casino garbage with a better subplot, but if we're being perfectly honest, we didn't need more new characters, we needed to see the existing characters get developed in interesting and meaningful ways. Phasma was a waste of a very talented actress.<br/><br/>I didn't care for Snoke in The Force Awakens, but the way he dies in the one is just dumb. The thing is, I don't really care about most of the new characters. I don't know enough about any of them really have an emotional investment in their triumphs and losses. When Purple hair crashes the ship, I didn't really feel sad / happy for her (although I was a little happy that an obnoxious character wasn't going to return in the next one). Were her children taken by the First Order? Was her family murdered by the Death Star 3.0? It wouldn't take much in the script for the Audience to feel a connection with her but nothing. As such there are no emotions. What a vapid and soulless piece of cinema... In one of the most visually stunning scenes in all of Star Wars we can't find a reason to care. I'm not even going to get into what they did to Luke's character, how >90% of the humor was bad, tonally deaf, and not delayed or the problems that making Rey a Mary Sue leads to for the franchise's future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I find it incomprehensible that they can think that this movie is a modern masterpiece. Even if the logic centres of your brain don't reject the deluge of plot holes, plot armoured characters, and jarringly injected political correctness, the story itself is total pants. This movie is so badly conceived and executed that it actually REDUCES the amount of joy you'll get if you rewatch the older SW movies... well, if your any sort of fan of Luke anyway.<br/><br/>The message of this movie is 'Get with these nihilistic times sister, because being THE hero is lame, and we're all heroes you see, so we all get a prize just for participating'. It doesn't appear that any sort of decent script writer did because the pacing, humour, and shape of the movie are all way off. I imagine director Rian Johnson was given a checklist of crappy ideas and scenarios by Disney that he had to somehow shoehorn into it. That would help to explain the out-of-character and moronic behaviour, and the endless unneeded side stories that often had little, or nothing, to do with the plot. They just burned valuable time that would have better spent world building and developing some of the secondary characters properly. For instance: - What is the rest of the galaxy up to after the events of the previous movie. You'd think some of them would be angry enough to do something. Say what you want about the prequels, but they always made you believe they took place in a vibrant and culturally diverse universe. The stakes just feel so small and inconsequential in this movie when compared to even 'Rogue One'.<br/><br/>Please don't be fooled by the thousands of Disney mandated positive reviews that have been appearing online - this movie is a dog, and it leaves me with absolutely no interest in where these movies are going nor desire to see what happens next.<br/><br/>R.I.P. my childhood hero and role model Luke Skywalker, and commiserations to Mark Hamill. You didn't deserve this treatment at all dude.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
