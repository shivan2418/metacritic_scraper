The movie gave no answers for some, and the ones we did get are so bad they ALMOST retroactively ruined the legacy of some of the characters. This script should have never seen the light of day, let alone gotten made. Mark Hamill probably wishes he had vanished irl instead of being forced to make this movie out of a contract he signed years ago before the Disney take over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It just knows it wants to be 'different', which actually wouldn't be too bad if this was a spinoff Star Wars movie ala Rogue One or the upcoming Han Solo solo film. I'm all for seeing experimental Star Wars films, but I also firmly believe that the Saga films are meant primarily to enrich and build upon the legends and mythology surrounding the Skywalker lineage.<br/><br/>But even when I try to embrace the changes that are being made to the aesthetics, narrative approach and character behavior,  TLJ still has a lot of issues unfortunately. There's a lot of cheap and forced humor that kills the mood and pulls people out of the experience. The plot wields flimsy character arcs and the cast has no chemistry with one another. There's lots of clunky and awkward exposition. New characters are introduced that either distract or complicate the overall narrative and are mostly forgettable or unlikable. Many of the effects could've used a few more passes. And it has so many 'gotcha' twists that it jumps at light speed beyond the boundaries of excessive. It makes subverting expectations a priority at the cost of good storytelling and it values unpredictability and excessive, cheap trickery over good setup and execution. They tried so hard make TLJ so different from traditional Star Wars that they forgot to simply...make a good movie.<br/><br/>But the real atrocity happens when the mythology and lore from the previous films are taken into consideration. The Last Jedi feels like it hates everything about Luke Skywalker and The Force Awakens. That last scene from TFA was built up to be a magical moment in the eyes of so many fans and in TLJ it's treated like a Pee Wee Herman joke. It's sidesteps so hard that it almost literally discards itself and makes a mockery of a beautifully executed ball pass. Finn and Poe's individual personalities and side stories are so bland and uninteresting that it grinds the momentum of the movie to a halt. Rey ends up feeling more like a supporting character. And veteran characters are treated as gimmicky rather than respected and beloved.<br/><br/>That's not to say there are no redeemable qualities. SOME of the humor works, Porgs are surprisingly delightful, there are several stunning money shots, Adam Driver brings his A-game as Kylo, everyone else does a good job acting with the material they were given, and there's a pivotal moment given to an unnamed character that felt genuinely inspired. Unfortunately, what little there is to commend gets pulled into the dark side by all of the issues caused by sloppy and adolescent storytelling. The Last Jedi is proving to be a very divisive film and with good reason. It's not a very good film on it's own merits, but once you factor in the mythology and lore of Star Wars it becomes a strong contender for the worst of the Saga films. It's a  flavor of the month movie that will age horribly among a line of films that are virtually timeless. It will be the black sheep of the Saga as it lowers the standards of what passes for a Saga film. It taints the legacy and the mythos in favor of fleeting meta narrative and Tweets. And it's a real shame considering this is both Mark Hammill and Carrie Fisher's last hurrah. If Episode 7 awakened the force, then The Last Jedi put it in a coma.<br/><br/>***SLIGHT SPOILERS***<br/>Other random issues with TLJ include: the entire 2nd act is basically the bad guys with their superior vessels chasing the good guys through space at matched speeds until the good guys run out of fuel (basically a non-chase) and it feels slooowww...in EVERY sense of the word. The Leia scene (you know what I'm talking about). The only lightsaber battle is forgettable after a few hours. The entire sequence on the casino planet felt like a deleted scene from the prequels. Supporting characters would rather free captive animals than free slave children. Snoke and Captain Phasma were very underwhelming. Cheap nostalgiac references that pose as intelligent metanarrative. Not enough crazy alien space monsters, not enough planetary exploration, not enough droid and alien sidekick action...and DEUS EX MACHINACEPTION!!!<br/>***END***</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

That's all I can ask.<br/>Too many questions to list, but here are a few: Why so many pointless creatures in every scene?  Why the half-baked "code cracking" storyline?  Why the needless characters?  Why is luke drinking milk like that(LOL)?.. God, I wanted this to be good.  I prayed this would be good.  But it's just not.  This movie is SLOW, despite the appearance.  Tedious.  Plodding.  Lacking characters we give a damn about.  The SW makers need to go back to what worked for this franchise: use real models (things that look real on screen).  Give us characters necessary to the plot, not just to the current "social construct."</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The last jedi is everything a fan would like. It continues to explore the new characters: Finn, Rey and specially Kylo Ren and Paul; it goes to places you didn't expect, and the space battles are the best in the entire franchise ( this movie really is a "star wars"). Visually speaking, this is also amazing: the last battle, Rey's training with the psychodelical scenes and fast montages. The franchise is not made only for hardcore fans, but for all kinds of people, it's a blockbuster just like the original movie, so it has action and also comedy, and TLJ knows that. The problems for me are the runtime (too long), and Finn and Rose arc (this last character I didn't like specially).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rather then follow those plot points Rian Johnson jettisons most of the major plot lines from the Force Awakens, so he can weave together a plot hole filled mess of a movie. A movie about a in space chase that defies logic. The complete character assasination of Luke, who tried everything to save his father who had already fallen to the darkside even risking his life. That Luke who would do all he did for a Father already fallen as he was, would almost kill his nephew before he had even fallen? The pointless social justice plot that added an extra useless hour to the movie that amounted to nothing, from a lack of communication from the Admiral to Poe. The egregious killing of of Snoke so we can be stuck with an angsty whiny villain rather then an intimidating one.<br/><br/>This movie was nothing but a massive mess that dropped ok ideas for bad ones and wrecked already well established characters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Overall, it just didn't quite come together to make the same quality movie as The Force Awakens and Rogue One.<br/><br/>POSITIVES<br/><br/>- Mark Hamill and Adam Driver absolutely killed it with their acting. They pretty much singlehandedly saved the movie from being a 4-5 for me.<br/><br/>- The plot is original. Those who complained that TFA was basically A New Hope should not be disappointed like that again.<br/><br/>- Cinematography and special effects were top notch. In particular, a certain space scene and a lightsaber fight were some highlights.<br/><br/>NEGATIVES<br/><br/>- There were certain things added that were clearly just meant to sell toys. They did nothing to advance the plot or develop characters (if you've seen the trailer, you'll know what I mean).<br/><br/>- Certain "main" characters were either: bland, served no purpose, and/or were shoehorned in.<br/><br/>- Despite an original plot, there were some crazy plot-holes and things that just didn't make sense.<br/><br/>- It was very jarring, tone-wise. Massive scenes of death and destruction were broken up by BB-8 doing goofy things and other characters giving Tony Stark-esque one-liners.<br/><br/>- Rian Johnson took JJ's foundation and just tossed it aside, for the most part. OVERALL<br/><br/>- This is a decent movie. Certainly worth going to see. Some of the acting and special effects were fantastic. The plot was fine for the most part. However, I'm more concerned going forward on how this film will affect the quality of the next film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Star Wars heroes prioritize love and friendship above all else, and this prioritizing drives the story.  Anakin went to the dark side to save his wife.  Luke left home to be a Jedi “like his father.”  Jyn’s father joined the Empire “to protect [her],” and ensured that she would find the plans to the Death Star by naming the file “Stardust,” his nickname for her.  Instead of leaving with suitcases of money, Han risked his life to save Luke twice (at the end of A New Hope and on Hoth in Empire Strikes Back).  Darth Vader spent all of Empire Strikes back trying to find his son.  And Darth Vader ultimately found Luke by setting a trap—Vader knew that his son would prioritize his friends, so Vader captured and tortured Luke’s friends to cause Luke to come to him.  Leia and Chewbacca turned around to save Luke at Cloud City.  Lando refused to call off the attack on the second Death Star because he knew that his buddy Han would get the shield down.  Anakin came back to the light side to save Luke from the Emperor.  Rey turned down handfuls of rations instead of giving away BB-8.  A Star Wars hero never leaves without first making sure his friends are safe.  One of my favorite moments is when, during the escape from Hoth in Empire Strikes Back, the action stops for a few seconds to show Luke watching the Millennium Falcon fly by—Lucas and Kirshner made sure that we knew that Luke knew his friends were ok. Sometimes this prioritizing leads the characters to good outcomes, like finding the death star plans, Anakin’s redemption, etc.  Just as often, it leads to bad outcomes, like Anakin turning to the dark side, Luke jeopardizing his training, characters putting themselves in harm’s way, etc.  But it’s that this prioritizing is driving events that has made all generations connect so deeply with “Star Wars” for over four decades. In “The Last Jedi,” this prioritizing was buried deep beneath the surface, if it was even present at all.  Rey’s priorities were finding her place in the universe and protecting the Jedi order.  The other characters’ priorities were winning the war against the First Order.  And there is nothing wrong with this.  But it’s not “Star Wars.”</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Many are saying it’s a new beginning and some others are saying it’s fresh air for the saga. I wish that were the case. I did not want Rian Johnson to repeat the easy JJ formula or just give fan service but he destroyed a beloved character and made a movie which script is lazy and not worthy of the saga.<br/><br/>Spoilers<br/><br/>I’ll only focus on how he destroyed Luke Skywalker who was for many of us a hero à la Superman.<br/><br/>That image of him about to strike Ben Solo in his sleep because he felt the dark side in him. That’s not Luke! That cannot be Luke because Luke already proved in the original trilogy he’s a much better Jedi than his ancestors.<br/><br/>It’s true that when the Jedi sensed the dark side, they thought about getting rid of its carrier. When Mace Windu confronted Palpatine, he thought it was best to strike him down and get rid of the menace. The same thing happened when Yoda and Obi Wan discovered they had no other choice but to confront (kill) Anakin and the Emperor. Needless to say, those killing instincts did not achieve anything.<br/><br/>But then, in the original trilogy we’re introduced to this farm boy named Luke. And we fell in love with his character and his growth and development over the trilogy. After the great revelation where he discovers Darth Vader is his father, he confronts Yoda and Obi Wan for not telling him and when the latter tells him he MUST face him again (obviously to kill him) and says he’s more machine than human, Luke says “I CANNOT KILL MY OWN FATHER” and when he does face Vader, after being tempted by the dark side and trying to protect his beloved twin sister, Luke is about to kill him but stops himself from doing it. He turns off his lightsaber and says he’ll never join the dark side.<br/><br/>And now this director (who claims being a fan) comes and envisions a Luke who was thinking about killing the son of his beloved sister and his best friend?<br/><br/>Shame on him and what a way to destroy the Skywalker saga!<br/><br/>You’re allowed to like it but hopefully you’ll be able to see why many of us DON’T.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Last Jedi is built around its characters and gives each of them satisfying arcs helping them grow as people. That forms the core of the movie and everything on screen ties into one of those arcs. MINOR- SPOILERS AHEAD Finn goes from a selfish deserter to someone willing to give his life for the cause. He learns the wider context of what he's fighting for by seeing the inequality on Canto Bight. Poe goes from a hotheaded 'hero' to someone who is truly starting to understand what it means to be a real leader. Rey and Kylo go from lost children unsure of their futures to committed adults ready to give everything to what they believe. They lose their respective mentors and now have to come into their own. Luke has a great arc from the reclusive cynic to the hero the galaxy needs after a pitch-perfect lesson from a fan favourite character- 'failure is the greatest teacher of all'. It's these arcs that hold The Last Jedi together and make it a rewarding film first and a fun Star Wars movie second. Throw in some standout performances and spectacular action and this is definitely a solid entry in the Star Wars series. By no means is it perfect but to say 'it's worse than the prequels' or 'Disney have ruined Star Wars' is completely unfair.<br/><br/>It's not going to be for everyone but as a huge Star Wars fan since the age of 6 (when I first saw ANH on its re-release), I was in no way disappointed and neither were the group of 7 fans of various ages and viewpoints that I saw it with.<br/><br/>You'll have to see The Last Jedi for yourself to make up your mind but it would be a shame if this is the film that causes a real split in the Star Wars fandom, I guess time will tell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are a lot of very strong moments.  The plot is very weak, and it's poorly edited.  Johnson was written into a lot of corners by JJ Abrams.  Instead of playing along and being creative, I feel he mostly threw out Abrams plot and decided to go his own way.  The logic tends to fall apart quickly and frequently.  While everyone seems to be interested in Rey's parentage, an area most professional reviewers seem to leave out is the problem of Rey's abilities, and how she got so strong with the Force in the first place.  Most professional reviewers don't talk about how interesting the idea of a stormtrooper becoming a good guy is, and how this movie wastes that storyline, if not making the character less sympathetic.  And the dashing 'flyboy' is castrated, his leadership arc making very little sense given the ridiculous plotting.  All of the fan boys, and I guess I'm now included, will get vilified as misogynists for disliking the decisions of the female leaders in this movie.  But just HAVING a lot of female characters shouldn't make this a good movie.  I like Rey, and I love Leia, but their development is tragic, and the new characters add absolutely nothing in terms of plot development.  There are great set pieces in this movie, and were it not for 30 or so terrible prequel-esque minutes, it's well made.  But it's gotta be far down the list in terms of rankings for Star Wars movies.  I'd say just above the prequels, but far below Rogue One and Force Awakens.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The new school of thought here seems to be: Who needs world building when we have big space battles and can make characters tell lame jokes like Poe's telephone support joke to Hux? Who needs character development when we can just throw in a female lead and make her all powerful with minimal explanation? Who needs to weave a story or tie up loose ends? Just make big explosions and a few by-the-numbers Big Battle Scenes™ and watch the money flow in. Just like Marvel Studios.<br/><br/>Lucas had his issues but at least we all knew the story of Star Wars was the story of the Skywalker family. The OT and PT weaved a mostly coherent story, despite Lucas' 20-year-later retcons and ridiculous plot devices. This new trilogy is a story of what, exactly? Rey the Wonder Girl? I have zero attachment to her because instead of weaving a story around her, she's a Mary Sue who can do everything better than every other established character with no personal growth, loss, or development. She can do more in two episodes than Luke could by the end of three, or Anakin by the middle of the third. Compare her character development at this time to the same development of either Luke or Anakin and you'll see how farcical her character is.<br/><br/>Finn and Poe should be the Han and Leia style secondary protagonists to Rey but instead both Abrams and Johnson try to spin them off as their own main protagonists. Due to this, we end up with half the movie being filler because had Leia or Holdo simply told Poe the Resistance's plan there would have been no need for the entire stealthy casino plot. Speaking of which, Benicio del Toro's talents were completely wasted in this haphazard story line. In a galaxy that we're told is full of scoundrels and ne'er-do-wells, "DJ" (literally his character's full name) isn't even top 20. Gwendoline Christie's talents were also wasted, as her Captain Phasma character is, again, left to be treated like a punch line (and a punching bag).<br/><br/>Johnson squats and takes a Porg sized dump on the entire story line of Luke Skywalker and the original trilogy, and he does so gleefully. He turns Luke into a grumpy hermit who literally tells Rey to get off his lawn. Not that Rey needs him, it turns out, because why should she? She's already better than him, as Johnson makes apparent in a contrived battle scene. Luke's "redemption" comes in the form of two nostalgia pieces from old characters... neither of which change the fact that Luke is written entirely out of character. Something even Mark Hamill complained about months ago.<br/><br/>Kylo Ren repeatedly stands center frame and repeats the lines of burning down the past. It's almost as if Johnson is using Ren to tell the audience that the old Star Wars is dead and the new Star Wars - HIS meandering mess of Star Wars - is all that's left. No thanks. I've been fooled twice now and as the old adage goes, shame on me. I won't be fooled a third time. It's crystal clear Star Wars has fully embraced the Disney dark side, a property to be exploited every year until it reaches a saturation point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

You also have a subplot with 2 characters ( Finn / Rose ) that gets another sublot with slaves that gets another subplot with Benicio Del Toro.

Rian, Kathleen and crew set out and destroyed the legacy characters. I normally watch Star Wars movies multiple times but this movie killed that.

Visuals are as good as FA or R1, but the story, tone, mood, and pacing are a disaster. Last Jedi goes in a radical & disappointing new direction that discards what Force Awakens had set up. Entire main characters from FA are reduced to cameos or quickly discarded. Plot threads from FA are not explored but are quickly/brutally dead-ended. Characters/Lore from the OT are mocked & handled very disrespectfully. Plot holes are huge and everywhere. This film should rightfully be named "The Last Star Wars Movie".</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

My favorite action movie of the year and certainly on my top 10 for the year. Each of the central characters had an arc. I was definitely surprised at several places the film went but it made for a more personal story that actually had something to say which is pretty rare. The whole film looked absolutely gorgeous and I can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>I think it's really interesting that people seemed to see two different movies. The movie I saw had substance and was dripping with creativity and talent. I have a hard time understanding the negative reviews for the film, but I do not offhandedly reject the notion that some people might not like it.<br/><br/>Kylo Ren and Rey are both fantastic in this movie and it even manages to make a character arc for Luke Skywalker, which while risky I think ultimately pays off in a big way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If "Force Awakens" (which I liked) fell too much on the "same" side of the equation, this film falls a bit too much for me on the side of being "different," to the point where it often doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie. But I doubt most of us (myself included) could have done any better if we had somehow been put in charge.<br/><br/>The best Star Wars movies, even in their darkest moments, had an element of hope of them. There was fun and joy in them. This film, from director-writer Rian Johnson, often feels too bleak and cynical to be enjoyed. (It's very much in line with "Looper," another film by Johnson.) So, respectfully, I have to say this movie isn't for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7908047"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">There are many reasons this movie deserves a low score, but I will only focus on two: it failed to evoke a sense of wonder and it was offensive.<br/><br/>Star Wars movies have found success despite their many flaws. They have never been Oscar quality films, yet they are wildly successful. I, as a fan, am willing to gloss over and reason away many of the flaws because the movies evoke a sense of wonder that is hard to find in other films. I have always felt like I was in a galaxy far, far away. Luke's journey through that galaxy has always made me feel like there is a greater purpose than this mundane life. Those feelings were expunged with poor comedy that serves as a public announcement, "Hey folks, don't forget, this is a silly fantasy movie and none of this is real." If the characters don't believe they are in a galaxy far, far away, how am I supposed to? Also, when you create a universe, you have to create a set of rules that the characters are bound by. Rian broke existing rules of the universe and introduced farfetched ones like little kids do during games they play with each other.<br/><br/>I found this movie offensive on many levels. I only want to point out one scene though. When Rey hands Luke his old lightsaber, Luke looks at it for a few seconds before chucking it behind him without a thought about where it was going to land. Let me remind you, that this scene was preceded with Rey ascending up a long flight of stairs to find Luke atop this island, implying that Luke is still this hero that others have to ascend to in order to meet eye-to-eye. When she finally handed him his old lightsaber, he behaved as though the lightsaber had no significance to him. I get it, Rian wanted to take the movie in a direction nobody expected. Fine. He didn’t have to do it with both middle fingers extended though. If you don’t understand why this moment is offensive, let me explain. That lightsaber has a lot of history. It was Anakin’s lightsaber that was used as he turned to the dark side. He eventually lost it in a fight with Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan held onto that lightsaber for years while he watched over Luke. Luke, like Rey, has always yearned to know who his father is. Obi-Wan shatters Luke’s understanding of who is father was by telling him Anakin was a Jedi Knight, someone of profound significance. He offers the lightsaber to Luke as proof. This is the first tangible object that we know of that belonged to Luke’s father and is now in Luke’s possession. Luke goes on to fight Darth Vader at Cloud City. He loses his hand and that lightsaber moments before learning that his father is actually the evil man looking right at him. He probably thought he would never see that lightsaber again. After thinking about this history, to say that Luke is not flooded with memories and emotions when he sees that lightsaber is offensive. Him seeing that lightsaber, in contrast to his robotic hand that only exists because his father cut off the real one, should have been a serious and thought-provoking moment for Luke. Making that moment thoughtless trashes all the history that comes with that lightsaber and it trashes everything Luke struggled to become in the previous films. This is why it is offensive. Rian could have easily pivoted the storyline in this scene without being offensive though. For example, he could have had Luke look at the lightsaber for a moment and then look at Rey and something along the lines of, “I cannot take this. I am not this person anymore.” He could give it back to Rey and then walk away. This would at least acknowledge that the lightsaber has significance to Luke and I would be left wondering, “What happened to him? Why has he changed?” which seems to be what Rian was trying to convey anyway.<br/><br/>I gave a score of 1 because there are a few, isolated scenes that I enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Like many, I created an account just to review this movie. I'm not here to scream about my butt-hurt, and I will not jump on the bandwagon of people claiming the movie sucked because of out of control SJWs and Political Correctness. I have no idea what those have to do with this movie. This movie suffers from far more fundamental issues: bad script, bad pacing, bad dialog, jarringly bad and out of place jokes, and plot holes big enough to, literally, drive a star-destroyer through. Worst of all though, it was really, really, boring. This is not the Star Wars movie we were looking for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is a different Star Wars film and isn't that what we've wanted for some time now? This is a gorgeous looking, entertainingly written, very well acted film that takes established characters in new directions I did not expect. The humor is a bit much, and some setups don't get the deserved payoff. I understand how divisive this film is. Honestly though, I think the harsh fan reaction is a gut reaction to unexpected outcomes. I was torn after seeing it the first time. I then thought about the film and while I have issues with it, the fan backlash is absurd. This is a good movie and for once, I'm with the critics on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

He is now a coward for not trying to help Kylo stay in the light (instead contemplating killing him), then he cowards out of killing him, cowards out of chasing him down and getting some of his students back, then cowards out to a planet to hide, tries his best NOT to teach Rey the force to deal with a problem he helped create, then when he does face Kylo, it is in the form of a hologram, in which, he dies anyways?<br/><br/>Why are Jedi so prone to "suicide by sith"??<br/><br/>Johnson absolutely RUINED his character. Now everytime I watch the classics, I will always be reminded of how pathetic he turned out. I was aggravated with how TFA raised so many questions, but then this movie completely ignores all of the mystery the previous movie created and gives trash answers to some of these questions (Rey's parents were drunk scrappers?? come on, that could have been revealed in TFA).<br/><br/>If the Rear Admiral was going to stay with the ship until it was destroyed, why not hyper-drive it into snoke's ship right away? why not use all of the other ships running out of fuel, like this instead? This movie was just busywork for the audience,and Johnson managed to ruin the legacy of the original characters in the process. A slow motion chase scene is really the plot???? The rebellion will be reborn with a handful of people left on the Millinium F at the end?<br/><br/>BTW, as much as we now know about space and how liquids in the body become vapor when exposed to space, Leia somehow wakes up and floats herself to recovery? GTFOH<br/><br/>HEY DISNEY, KEEP THE SAME DIRECTOR THRU ALL 3 episodes! This is comparable to building a house using 3 different builders, and nobody is accountable for how disjoined the outcome is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I will acknowledge that this movie burned down every major plot point set up to be explored by the first movie, but I for one was greatly relieved by that fact. I'm so sick of tropes revolving around missing parents and an emperor figure pulling the strings that I was personally glad when they jettisoned those plot points in favor of something new. td;dr, IMO if you disliked VII like I did, you'll probably like this one, and vice versa.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is a nuanced, intelligent film that has gone over the heads of, at this time of writing, 1,333 metacritic users.  The complaints that the film is geared toward getting a broader audience demographic is sheer sexist nonsense from those who don't want to see women in power.  The issues people have with Luke not coming out of retirement to laser-sword Snoke, Ben Solo, and the rest of the first order is a bunch of kids being butthurt that their fantasies haven't been fulfilled.  They would set aside all of Luke's history - has lack of training, his stubbornness, his defeatism - and turn him into a powerhouse Jedi saviour.  Well folks, it doesn't work that way.  This movie captured his flaws perfectly and developed a reasonable outcome from those issues.  Best movie of the new series so far and sets the universe up for an incredible finale in Star Wars 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian didn't want to use ANYTHING from JJ's script. The Force Awakens is pointless. All our burning questions are pointless; all resolved in an off-hand manner, if resolved at all. Light speed kamikaze ships should be used in every future space battle against big capital ships. No point to have trench runs, dog fights, asteroid field chases... just get a droid to pilot a ship at light speed into another and boom, we don't need to watch any Star Wars space battle again. Or better yet, why use droids... just use newly introduced characters we care not a jot for to do it.

It was like that episode of South Park with Spielberg and Lucas doing unspeakable things to Indiana Jones, but worse. This went on for two and a half snooze-inducing hours. Boring and inconsequential subplots that have no relation to the main conflict. Extensive cross-cutting. Cheap humor at the expense of the lore. Rey's journey is bland as a shaved potato. Waste. Hubris. Idiocy. No answers or respect for the past films. No understanding of mythology. Tone-deaf dialogue and boring direction. Lazy cinematography and choreography. This is the worst Star Wars film and I am done with Disney Star Wars. It's no longer canon to me and this is the last time I'm paying to them in theaters. Give me 200 million dollars and I would have made a far better movie than this piece of trash. The Porgs were cute, though. Oh and check out my essay on Medium called "The Last Jedi: On the Character Assassination of Luke Skywalker" (I can't link it here, they'll delete my review again).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Anytime this film gets into serious star wars territory it seems to stop itself with the equivelant of a momma joke.  The jokes would be more at home on a late night talk show than a Star Wars movie.  The is some solid acting, but a lot of films do some things right. So what?  This is Star Wars we expect more.  This is a prime of example of Hollywood pandoring to the audience.  It was trying to please people rather than create an artistic and entertaining movie.  There are parts that are clearly scrapes for the true fans, but amount to no more than nostalgic nonsense.  This makes for a tonally imbalanced film.  Jumping from serious to goofy.  It tries to attract demographics rather than just people.  Aside from tone, half the plot is worthless and wouldnt be out of place in the prequels.  There is little character development that is riddled with plot holes.  Some of these problems are simply a hangover from TFA such as Rey's abilities, but majority are new.  Stars Wars fans wanted was a continuation of the OT, but what we got was terrible characters with disjointed development if any.  The problems began in TFA and continue throughout this movie. Disney thought they could buy us off with a few scenes of nostalgic imagery, but even those were usually ruined by an out of place goof.   I could go on and on with why this is an aweful movie, but this will suffice.  This is not Star Wars.  This is corporate Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It was surprising, thoughtful and deep. It has one of the best lightsaber fights in the entire franchise, a starship moment that made the entire audience gasp, creatures around long enough to be cute but not get annoying, characters who made big decisions instead of having the plot happen to them, and stakes that haven't felt as high since the Empire Strikes Back.  I agree with the professional critics, and I don't get the dislike of this movie.  Just because you don't like what happens is not a reason to hate the movie. People didn't like that Han was frozen in carbonite, either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As a long time SW fan, I was hoping to be shocked by the unexpected, and I truly was. The plot is relatively simply: The remnants of the Resistance are seeking to escape The New Order and Rey is searching to be trained as a Jedi. Both have conflict, with TNO being able to track the resistance, who are running low on fuel, and Luke Skywalker being a broken shell of the hero we once loved. All characters, both friend and foe go through transformations. It was especially fun to not be able to guess what was going to happen from one scene to the next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I love preachy, condescending social justice themes in my sci fi (whether I agree with them or not). You really don’t have enough girl power in this movie - More cowbell! Laura Dern’s character is such a pivotal historical figure in the series and deserved such a large climatic role unlike Admiral Akbar who you rightfully unceremoniously killed off and literally gave his seat to someone no one cared about. I love how you developed a new character - Rose but completely ignored any development of prior main characters. I love how righteous and powerful every female character is in the movie and all male characters are impulsive and/or bumbling broken idiots. More cowbell!<br/>/sarcasm<br/><br/>Seriously you could have saved this movie if you put any of the franchise actor in the Laura Dern role.  What is her name again? Admiral Mary Sue?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Let's start with Yoda, I love Yoda but why is he "old" and barely moving around when Anakin was made young again at the end of Ep6. Also he's solid not a ghost. Why was Admiral Akbar killed off with no fanfare and who the hell is the second in command with Leia? Why should I care about here???<br/>Speaking of caring, what's up with Finn & Rose and their pointless adventure that was painstakingly slow. Not a fan of Rose's acting ability just not good...<br/>I'll end with Luke's ending (but I could go on). For a powerful Jedi, they never let him go full Jedi. I mean when he faced off against Emo, sorry I mean Kylo, I was so ready for him to raise arms and knock down AT-AT's like dominos, I have played games with Jedi's who brought down Star Destroyers.

An example of Lukes awesome control of the force, but once completed.....<br/><br/>SPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERS<br/>SPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERS<br/>SPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERS<br/>SPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERS<br/>SPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERS<br/>SPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERS<br/>SPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERS<br/>SPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERS<br/>SPOILERS   SPOILERS    SPOILERS<br/><br/>He simply " lets go " of his mortal existence and fades into the force. What a complete waste. It struck me at first that Luke had willingly allowed this to happen and that he had committed suicide. A few hours later, a line Kylo came out with earlier in the film came to mind, when he first communicated with Rey within the force, he says something like " How are you doing this? This should be tearing you apart".  This comment implies that force projection is very hard and very dangerous to do, and I see now, why that line was included .  But it still doesn't make me feel better that Luke has been written out of the Star Wars saga. First we lose Han and now Luke in the films, and of course Carrie in real life. A real shame. I would have rather seen each character say their goodbyes and ride off into the sunset myself, but no, the new star wars movies have killed them. A real shame...<br/><br/>But....I'll still go see this again, there's enough good stuff in the film to almost counter balance the films other events, but the Canto Bight scenes were a tad pointless and drawn out, the whole lot could have been done in a  five minute heist scene in my opinion.<br/><br/>So, there you go. I'm going again, and I'll buy it on Bluray, but the loss of Luke will sting forever. As it does with Han.<br/><br/>7/10 ( Better than Phantom Menace )</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Some parts of it like the star battle scenes you could say we've seen it all before. Having a little humor is okay as we did from the start of this series, but the way it was done in this movie was so campy and inappropriate, almost like they hired Seth Rogen to write the comedic parts. Those parts might have been funny if you are eight years old. I hear there is one more episode coming.... when it does I doubt i'll go to the theater, might wait until it comes out on Redbox for $1.50 if i have nothing else to watch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I know Lucas made mistakes but this poorly told story goes out of its way to undermine everything special George created.  Shame on Johnson, the story group and whoever did not stop this slop from getting on the screen.  The lack of SW feel, sincerity, and genuine characters is disturbing.   Then there is the inability to give quality answers to the questions posed in its predecessor.  It seems that there was never a story plan at all and this is just action set pieces to wow the audience.  That garbage might work with Transformers fans but this is SW.  For most of us, George Lucas taught us to appreciate story and the heroes journey, that Joseph Campbell preached into relevancy.  SW fans are not stupid and should not be treated that way. This is how i felt leaving the theater.<br/><br/>I am not entertained or amused by milking alien creatures, characters acting out of character, and subplot characters who have no relevancy on the universe.  When you see the movie you will know my meaning  I am also not interested in shirtless bad guys or thin plot points with flat back door answers.  The worst crime this movie commits is a blatant slap in Lucas's face by denouncing the very essence of the Force.  Treating our prior characters like morons and completely missing the points that the prequels established.  Ep's 1-3 may have faults but they did explain the universe.  George is a smart storyteller and this movie obviously wants nothing to do with his theories.  It's shameful and disturbing. I feel there is no way to save the third installment of this trash, so it must play out.  But a house cleaning should be done immediately and a person who loves and knows SW should be put in charge of story development.  There have been many aside from Lucas who get it over the years: Zahn, Filoni, and whoever should be complimented on Rogue One.  This atrocity should not go unnoticed and if you are a fan who bashed the prequels you should be even more enraged than Anakin cutting pears with the force.  This Last Jedi should be the LAST bad SW movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But as a sequel to The Force Awakens, not great at all - it's like RJ decided to make a sequel to an imaginary version of TFA that only existed in his head. I saw it on opening night, as I left the cinema I wasn't sure how I felt about it. Thinking about it since, the basic plot, muddled character development and the multitude of missed/squandered opportunities are harder and harder to ignore due to their impact on the trilogy or the brand as a whole.

I was very hyped and exited to see this....but the whole "Disney owned" came along....It's by far the worst star wars movie ever, and the most boring as well..<br/>The potential of old and new characters, all to waste.. No epic Jedi training, No epic High Master Jedi Luke action (oh right we saw him milking a space cow,also we see a terrible astral projection "fight" with Kylo that brings him to death...JESUS) , terrible villain character progress(Kylo ren,no one feels scared,threatened or feared at all).. Failed attempts of humor and the usuall recycled motives and space scenes. A lot of scenes like Fin's where boring and others where totally out of star wars tone. So the result is: 1)The epic old characters are gone without grace and also without even been "used" propperly 2) The new ones are boring and hollow, some of them are gone as well allready, like Supreme leader Snoke (what a joke) 3)Forget the Jedi/Sith theme 4)There are new creatures like Porgs, so Disney can become even richer from toys to keep paying the critics and butchering every epic/historic franchise along the way.. The script was clear: Destroy star wars, any way possible..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I docked it a point for a few plot holes but overall I enjoyed the story, each characters progression throughout the film and the separate journeys that they were set on, as well as the interactions between the two leads.  I thought Luke was amazing (wipes shoulder off) and MH performance was his best. I enjoyed the jokes and didn't think they felt out of place because EVERY Star Wars movie has jokes in it (Walking Carpet, I love you...I know, Nerf Herder, JarJar (hehe), etc.). Overall, I'm excited for the next Star Wars film (Solo) and the next film in the main Saga.

There are a few things that keep it from a ten. But there are somethings in this movie that just blow me away. If you don't understand what Disney is trying to do with Star Wars then you will not get this movie. Carrie fisher dyeing is exactly why Disney is doing what they are doing. Killing off Han and kind of Killing off Luke is the point. These guys are old they cant and probably dont want to do these movies. Star wars is not easy. Even Daisy Ridley sounds like she does not want to do them. Star Wars Fans are crazy and probably annoying. We make it rough on these actors. I didn't like flying Leia and maybe a little too much comedy maybe. I say maybe because I did laugh at some things. I dont like the fact the they did two David and Goliath parts in this movie. I mean the Rebals have now destroyed Starkiller base, A Dreadnought and now Snokes big ass ship. Enough with this crap. To be honest If I could just watch the Jedi Sith stuff This movie would be a perfect score. The interactions between Luke and Rey, Then Rey and Kylo then Kylo, rey and Snoke. Then Kylo and Luke were just perfect. And "Yoda knocking some sense into Luke was awesome. There are some holes in this story that are just plain lazy writing and that is what knocks this to an 8 out of ten. But this is a great movie and I loved it and want to watch it again and again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

You do NOT screw over Luke like that. There was all-around bad writing in this flick, and most characters became more boring, somehow being undeveloped as the film went on. The acting was phenomenal, but the writing and directing was terrible. I get that Luke needs to pass on the baton, but have him do it in a better way, with valor and bravery, not wasting away on an island. This was just subpar in almost every way. I can't fathom what would make anyone enjoy this film. Rian Johnson's attempts to "getcha" and pull the rug out from under you by being subversive in his plot points only succeeded in making an awful movie with no real development or satisfying world building. This winter, if you're looking for a great Star Wars flick, stick with the Holiday Special.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I really wanted to like this movie. I loved both The Force Awakens and Rogue One, but The Last Jedi (more like the Last Jest) left me more disappointed and upset leaving the theater than any other movie. This film is a MESS that is full of plot holes, a poor script and colossal failures. It does have some good moments but they are too few and far between the bad. How this film is being universally praised by critics is beyond my comprehension.<br/><br/>Within the first 5 minutes of watching this film I had a bad feeling about it. Starting with the prank phone call between Poe and General Hux. This moment was what really set the tone of the movie for me, not in a good way. This is a scene with tension and stakes, but it's ruined with tedious humor and one liners. This is one of the major issues the film is plagued with. There is simply too much cheesy humor peppered into many scenes throughout the movie. Every time something emotional happens its cut off with a throwaway joke. It's overkill. I understand Star Wars is supposed to have moments of levity and humor, the original films had many moments of humor. The only difference is that it was subtler and allowed the film to breath in between these moments. The film doesn't need “DID YOU GET THE JOKE, DID YOU GET IT?” type of humor. Emotional scenes had impact, they weren’t the butt end of a joke. Another issue I had was next to nothing is answered from the Force Awakens. What’s Luke been doing for the last 30+ years? Who are the Knights of Ren? Who is Snoke? Who are Reys parents? How did the First Order Rise to power? Why ask these questions at all in Ep. 7 only to throw everything out? What is the payoff for the final scene in the Force Awakens? Not a thing. Just Luke casually throwing his old blue light saber over his shoulder like it meant nothing at all.<br/><br/>The plot is a disaster. The major premise of this film is a chase between the First Order and the Resistance, which lasts almost 2 hrs. Apparently, spacecraft can manage light speed travel, but are still dependent on a consumable fuel source? This was never an issue an any previous installment. You’re telling me that the First Order in no way could catch up to the rebel fleet? Their ships were much larger, powerful and they had more small craft at their disposal. Abysmal writing if you ask me. Disney has all of the money and resources at their disposal and this is the best they could come up with? This reads like Spaceballs more than Star Wars.<br/><br/>So, we are left with a heavily flawed film that literally goes nowhere. The pacing was off as the film zig-zagged from scene to scene so often I felt it was made for the ADHD generation. It introduces useless new characters (Rose, DJ, Holdo), gives little screen time to fan favorites (R2, Chewbacca) or just outright butchers them (Luke, Leia). Rian Johnson wastes any potential from previous installments and leaves J.J. Abrams to clean up the mess.<br/><br/>The only redeeming qualities this film has are the visuals, the score and some of the performances. I did enjoy the scenes between Luke, Rey and Kylo. I felt the film should have focused more on these relationships.<br/><br/>Other dislikes:<br/>- Luke milks a Cow-Giraffe Alien and drinks the milk like a caveman in front of Rey.<br/><br/>- Luke doesn’t really train Rey at all. She seems to grasp every aspect of being a Jedi on her own. Her scene investigating the cavern within the dark side hole with the mirror was pointless and went nowhere.<br/><br/>- Leia becomes master of the force in space and becomes… Superleia?<br/><br/>- The entire section with Finn and Rose on Cano Bight was a pointless subplot that never goes anywhere. The filmmaker’s care more about having scenes riding giant donkey rabbits than developing previously established characters and plot lines.<br/><br/>- Phasma is wasted in 5 minutes.<br/><br/>- Snoke, apparently the main villain, is pathetic. We learn nothing about who he is or what his motivations are. Somehow, he is the all powerful dark side master but can’t foresee what’s happening. Even with Kylo manipulating a light saber inches away from him.We learn nothing, he just dies halfway through.<br/><br/>- The character of Luke Skywalker is butchered. That’s all I’ll say on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I’ll fix it. Instead of 18 hr space chase, (dumb), Leia surviving the explosion into space (more dumb considering they know Carrie Fisher died) the Resistance gets to Crete where they fight against the FO, think WWI Battle of Argonne forest, or the Spartans in 300. They are decimated. Finn dies in that scene saving the Resistance by flying his cruiser into the battering ram making the ultimate sacrifice. Luke arrives on Crete, leaving after feeling Leia succumb to her injuries in search of Rey who left Ahch-To prematurely to confront Kylo. There Luke connects with DJ who sneaks him and Rose onto the Supremacy to confront Snoke who’s holding Rey hostage and Luke dies fighting Snoke and Kylo in the throne room not before taking out all the guards and saving Rey who escaped with Rose and DJ. Snoke barely survives, Kylo is visited by force ghost Anakin during the climactic scene of Luke’s death. The End. How **** hard would it be to give fans a glorious death. Something to look forward to in Episode 9. “Nah”, says Johnson, “I think I’ll just f@ck the whole Star Wars universe up because my corporate overlords at Disney can’t market anymore toys and **** off the old cast. That’s what we’ll do.” They want you to think that so we build all the hype like we did for Episode VIII all over again. They (Disney) don’t even have to spend a penny marketing. Bloody Brilliant! Hopeful in-denial fans will create fantastic theories all over again just to get **** slapped in the face like we did in this c@nt of a film!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are zero rules to anything happening in the movie, the new order always fails to accomplish anything and the resistance seems succeed out of sheer luck. Also the Plot between Rey and Luke is uninteresting while poorly trying to imitate the excitment of Lukes first Introduction to the force.<br/><br/>I could go on ranting about nearly every aspect of this bad movie in detail, but I want to spare myself from reliving to much of this awful experience. I guess after a mediocore Episode VII I will have to accept that Disney isnt capable of capturing the essence of what made Star Wars fun.<br/>Generally it doesnt at all feel like a Star Wars movie, and you shouldnt waste your money on going to the cinema seeing this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
