After having read hours of user reviews and comments I've swayed back and forth between masterpiece and mediocre. There are just so jaw dropping moments in the movie and I love how they've figuratively thrown away baggage and tropes of the previous movies to create something new. I feel that in 10 years time this will be more fully appreciated by the fans once it's seen in the complete context of the full trilogy (and the future trilogy.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Very inconsistent with its own plot from the first movie much less the entire star wars lore. I am sure the director never heard of the star wars movies much less watched them. Next time you have a new director create a sequel, have them watch the previous movie and read up just a page or so on the lore. OR, get a few of the millions of fans to come in and give feedback on your plot line. Synopsys: Luke an old emo Grinch that has no real power and can’t see the good in people any longer; Leia is an immortal flying wizard super woman terminator; Rey is a force god (with two weeks of inexperience under her belt); Kylo is a barely force sensitive snot nosed millennial with daddy issues and a bad temper; the emperor really has no power and only serves to display a return of the jedi moment; the entire galaxy forgot about force field shields; there is now gravity in space; single fighters can take out entire giant battle ships (see shield reference); death star laser cannons can only make tiny holes in giant doors, ginormous ships can be taken out by ramming others ships into them (see shield reference again), the first order now controls the entire galaxy, the rebel alliance is only made up of a few hundred people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

While I didn't think it was as consistently strong as The Force Awakens, with a few strange scenes, like Luke Skywalker's daily routine on Ahch-To, I found it absolutely refreshing to see a Star Wars movie where I genuinely had no idea what would happen next. Compared to Rogue One from last year, it had the distinct advantage of not being any form of prequel, and compared to Force Awakens, it felt like it was completely unique, not rehashing anything. What this "second installment" gets right, compared to Empire Strikes Back and contrasted with Attack of the Clones is the theme of failure. What was missing (among a long list of things) from Attack of the Clones is the characters failing with consequences. In Last Jedi, Poe ignores General Leia's orders, and absolutely decimates the Resistance in the process. In Empire Strikes Back, Luke leaves his master behind on Dagobah and loses his arm, and almost gets his friends, whom he rushed to save, killed. Another aspect that made this movie so enjoyable to me is the "everyday hero" aspect of it. It's so rare in the Star Wars universe (so far, at least) to see a hero who isn't anybody special. This new generation of heroes are unique in that aspect, that Poe, Rey, Finn and Rose are, really, nobody special. But the direction this movie takes them in, especially with the ending scene of a child on Canto Bight, using the force, and looking up at the stars, is that anyone can be a hero. It is not one's bloodline or one's family name that determines their worth. Anyone can succeed, and more importantly, anyone, regardless of family name or status (such as Kylo Ren, in this film and the last) can fail. Overall, while it isn't my favourite of the whole saga (Return of the Jedi takes the crown for me), and it isn't the best in terms of the complete package (Empire Strikes Back, of course, takes that cake), it is certainly a worthy addition to the ever growing Star Wars family.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Finn and rose go to a casino planet and do nothing for 30 minutes or more. Like straight up nothing.<br/>The whole rebel alliance are mentally handicapped that pretty much kills themselves for no reason, and everything could have been solved if COMMANDER PURPLE HAIR TOLD THEM THE PLAN.<br/>Purple hair is the sole reason why the rebel army almost got destroyed. Leya had a fake out death, everyone in the cinema got quiet and saw Leya float in death cold. It was sad. AND THEN SUDDENLY LEYA TURNED INTO SUPERMAN AND FLEW BACK TO THE SHIP.<br/>It was so god damn stupid it hurt me on a level i did not think was possible.<br/>Snoke died pretty anti-climatic and we have no idea what he was who he was or what he wanted.<br/><br/>The only good part in the movie that really saved it from a lower score was Kylo Ren, everytime he was on the screen i was hooked and i really wished that the movie had focused more on Kylo, Rey, luke and snoke. Learning why the Jedi failed and what the future needs.<br/>Instead we got a rushed ending and suddenly Rey can use the force whenever she want. with no training. Only see this movie if you can do it for free because half the movie is just no worth the money and the other half is decent. But not good enough to carry the whole movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Out of everyone I know IRL the BEST review was that it has cool space battles but terrible writing.  UNFAIR UNFAIR UNFAIR that no one can say this movie has bad writing without being called a Trump MAGA troll.  If this movie has an agenda it utterly failed at that agenda because the writing is TERRIBLE.  The plot goes no where the 2nd act is utterly disposable (but then the others are too really).  The character motivations don't add up.  Any suspense that is built up is discarded and then followed with a "haha" trolling joke.  Whether you compare this movie to SW prequels, originals or other movies out this year, this movie is BAD.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It holds up pretty well in terms of effects, directing, and editing. However, fans are destroying this movie simply because the nostalgia for older movies, wanting everything to remain the same, which makes sense, as in this movie everything that was built before was completely teared appart. Nonetheless, this is a storyline, and it cannot stay the same. Yes, some of the humor is out of place, but the rest of the script is well written and characters are well developed (except snoke, a simple plot device whose death did not trigger me, as I expected it to come since Kylo was always highlighted as the true antagonist). Anybody saying that the prequels or rogue one are better than this one for sure have no knowledge at all on what constitutes a good movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7947448"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This was a movie that I had been anticipating for a long time and what they did to the whole Star Wars franchise was just shocking.<br/><br/>Racism and sexism were apparent throughout the film - against white males. You have all these women in roles protecting men from danger, while the men sit around and let the women fight - not a biblical picture of Godly men stepping up at all. Dave Shilling from Birth Movies Death has a great quote, "The series’ millennial good guys are a young white woman, a black man, a woman of Asian descent, and a Latino man, while its millennial bad guys are two white dudes."<br/>The jokes were so bad. There was so much unnecessary humor that was so uncalled for. Throwing the lightsaber off the cliff. That wasn't funny at all - I knew the movie was ruined right from that moment.<br/>They have ruined the Star Wars that was so happily ended in Episode 6 Return of the Jedi. They killed Han Solo and made his and Lea's marriage disappear (more progressivism) in the last movie, and if that wasn't bad enough in this movie they make Luke, one of the most humble characters in Star Wars, into a jerk who hates Jedi. Mark Hamil even when on a rant after filming about how disappointed he was with his character Luke and said he was manipulated into someone he never wanted to be. And WHY ARE FORCE GHOSTS SO POWERFUL??? I am a true Star Wars fan and let me tell you that fans of the FIRST Star Wars episodes that were so good (4-6) did not enjoy this new movie.<br/>So much for fan theories. They killed off Snoke without telling us anything. They made Rey's parents into nothing and ruined all the hopes of fans. They do not care in the least what we think.<br/>The part when they went to the gambling planet was so unnecessary and I was completely lost.<br/>They made Poe, one of the best characters, into a really mean person who is outdone in character and wisdom by...you guessed it, a female commander who he is a jerk to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

That was the feeling watching The Last Jedi. Even George Lucas's failed prequels were more movies than this latest effort. Rogue One, while beating you over the head with nostalgia, was still a passable movie. The Force Awakens, while plagiarizing the original trilogy, still had craft behind it; true skill, and an adherence to the structure that not only made these movies great, but also recalled the films that originally inspired Lucas. While The Force Awakens wasn't perfect, The Last Jedi honors that movie, and the task undertaken by it's characters, by crapping all over that it. It effectively throws everything from that TFA out and replaces it with vapid nonsense. The FAR TOO MANY jokes don't land, characters are not who we know them to be, and the many plot holes you could fit a Star Destroyer through.<br/><br/>There are some great visual effects and some nice explosions and fights. But frankly that's it. Oh and by the way they COMPLETELY destroy the character of Luke Skywalker, one of the greatest characters that movies and literature have ever had. I've never seen something as completely disgusting as this movie. Rian Johnson should be ashamed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

He was defeated by the new Goddess of the saga, Rey. 2) Snoke sucks too, he got killed off by the cry boy Kylo Ren... So there are no respectable bad guys...<br/>3) Leia can now fly?!?! Since when? She has ZERO training... 4) ALL male characters suck. I'm fine with Luke dying, but the way in which they did it and the way in which his character was represented is nothing short of DISGRACEFUL. He didn't even get his own Yoda moment when we were like WOW! This guy is actually a great warrior or anything.. Instead, we just saw him create an illusion and then dying off.. 5) Luke got beat up by Rey?!?! Seriously?! If Star Wars would've been respected at all Rey would've stood a snowball's chance in hell to even hit Luke at all. 6) Disney **** on the history and lore of star wars and disrespected us fans by portraying Luke like an idiot and killing him off like an idiot. F*** Disney, I'm done with them. Not a SINGLE dollar more I will give them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Last Jedi feels like when the MTV Movie Awards used to parody scenes from popular movies. General Hux getting a crank call on the bridge, Luke throwing away the light saber like trash, then going to milk a sea creature's nipple, Leia flying through space and making fun of her hair style. This isn't supposed to be a throwaway Marvel movie with lots of cheap laughs. Doing so undermines the evil of the villains and makes light of the seriousness of the themes of the movie. The characterizations of Luke and Leia feel false. After watching 5 of her planets blown up, finding out the First Order corrupted her son to kill his father and watching her friends including Ackbar blown into space, the Leia of the original trilogy would be lightspeed ramming Snoke's ship herself not sending a  subordinate to do it. Luke would never attempt to kill his sister's son while he was sleeping, run away to an island to die alone, ignore his sister's call to join the fight, and then refuse to show up in person to protect her like a damn coward. Whomever wrote this movie didn't understand the characters and didn't care about disgracing them in their last scenes.<br/><br/>The movie lacks any continuity from the Force Awakens even though they take place moments apart. Why was a map left to find Luke, why is the Resistance completely wiped out, why didn't Hux return to Snoke,  how is Finn and his jacket okay when he just had his spine sliced by Kylo Ren? Plot ideas and interesting characters that Force Awakens created are abandoned with total disinterest (Snoke, Knights of Ren, Phasma). The 3 new hero characters are robbed of major hero moments and are isolated the whole movie. The movie wastes our time with 2 secondary plots that accomplish nothing other than a very cool explosion and a long prequel-esque escapade to a Casino planet. A good story teller would've at least had Leia pilot that ship into Snoke like a mofo and time it so the explosion stuns Snoke, saves Rey, giving Kylo the opportunity to kill Snoke. The way they wrote this movie both the good and bad guys looked weak and stupid when both should be impressive. Finn and Rey's competence in combat against much more experienced fighters remains an ongoing mystery that might just be a result of awful storytelling.<br/><br/>The movie is not original either. The entire Rey story is stolen from ESB. She travels alone to a distant plant to meet a strange reclusive Jedi Master for training, while there she discovers an ominous cave that will hint the truth about who she is before disobeying the Jedi Master and confronting an enemy that reveals who her parents are (Dagobah = Ach-To). That is the main plot of ESB beat for beat. Meanwhile the rebels bunkered-in fight AT-AT's on a salt/snow planet that they must retreat for their lives (Crait=Hoth). While visiting a corrupt wealthy planet the good guys meet a shady character they ask for help but he betrays them (Canto Bight=Cloud City). Do not tell me Last Jedi is any more original than Force Awakens.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Since Old Rebublic is non canon now i feel like lore of the siths have to be represented much more. Dont think thats gona happen in 9th episode. Snoke is a joke and this is very sad.

So should we be surprised that this movie has gotten so poorly rated by fans? Because of the innumerable plot holes and invalidating 40 years of Star Wars history this movie is beyond bad. Surprising the audience is one thing but this is just denigrating history.<br/><br/>I think most fans understand and agree that the definition of Star Wars movies needs to eventually expand and it naturally would have. However, you can’t just take a shortcut to get there by retconning the 40-year history of the Skywalker saga. There is still going to be hundreds more Star Wars movies made by Disney you would think they could have left the Skywalker Saga alone to some extent. I suppose The Force Awakens direction unfortunately put all this in motion but Last Jedi still did not have to so completely invalidate the importance of George Lucas’ Skywalker saga. I have no idea how episode 9 can possibly fix any of this without coming off overly contrived. The first 6 episodes of the Skywalker saga and Rogue One ultimately all lead to a very satisfying logical cohesive conclusion. Disney having a new director pop in to each new episode in the new trilogy and take it in their own personal direction clearly does not lend itself to creating a cohesive new trilogy story. This movie amazingly also retcons most of anything you would care about from The Force Awakens too. I agree surprising the audience is valuable but when that is achieved by just simply saying everything before me is just not valuable anymore that comes off as cheap, unearned, insulting and just poor story telling. This movie sadly as many have stated in a way destroys Star Wars. Things that are no longer valuable in Star Wars if we are to believe this movie: Jedi, goodness, fighting for good, lightsaber battles, Anakin, Vader, Luke, Jedi training, respecting tradition, Luke being a Jedi, Yoda thinking training is important, shields, respect for the chosen one fulfilling the prophecy and bringing balance to the force, respect for the chosen one’s lightsaber. If none of these things are valuable anymore then why did Disney in even buy Star Wars? It’s as if this movie is stuck up on itself and thinks it’s more important than all the other movies before it. This movie actively makes you try to feel bad for believing in anything that came before it. This movie in a vacuum still does not deserve to be rated well for its innumerable plot hole issues but ultimately this movie deserves a negative rating because of what it represents to Star Wars as a whole. These are dark times for Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Every situation has only one possible solution that seems impossible, and they foil it every-time, which becomes monotonous and anticlimactic, after the third act you're dying for the credits, but it drags it out with not much to show for it. The old films visually age, but the music and the bare bones story hold up over time, at the moment this new film looks beautiful and in terms of sounds, sounds fantastic. But it 20 years the story will still be **** and will visually have aged.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Is only a "tribute film" made to win money because it says "Star Wars" on the titles... The new "story" is pure garbage with no creativity and plot holes everywhere. It have no sense.<br/>Star Wars is not a movie that you need to see it twice so you can understan it.<br/>The only good thing is that John Williams is behind the music and you can feel that Star Wars essence that also was missing on Episode VII. BUT THATS ALL!!! Its like a slap on the face to Star Wars fans...<br/>The scene of Luke throwing the lightsaber over his shoulder feels like the way Disney sees the complete saga and George Lucas's story.<br/><br/>They can do a lot of spin-off movies using ideas taken from the expand univers like "SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE" and with that build a great story like they do with "ROGUE ONE". But no by taking the story of six movies and throwing it to the garbage traying to do "something new" for the new generations...<br/><br/>For me and a lot of people to; Episode VII and VIII never existed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7946081"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">It really bothers me that Rian Johnson did to TFA what Luke did to the lightsaber in the beginning: Looked at it and threw it away. I loved TFA and I was excited for the future installments, but upon seeing TLJ twice I really don't think it is as good as it could've been had it built upon TFA. Here are a couple of examples: 1) Rey's parents were built up as this big mystery in TFA, even through-out the first half of this film and they are revealed to be nobody in particular, just some junkheads from Jakku. Excuse me, what? 2) Same with Snoke, who is this mystery villain? He's just randomly killed off by Kylo Ren. Excuse me, what? 3) The ending of TFA was a big cliffhanger, with Rey handing Luke his lightsaber. What happens in TLJ? Luke looks at it and throws it away. Excuse me, WHAT? 4) Rey and Finn build this relationship with each other but in TLJ this is movie they barely share any screentime. 5) I guess Rian Johnson didn't like Kylo Ren's helmet... meh.<br/>Other negative points for me: 1) The middle of the movie is BORING. We cut between Canto Bight and Acht-Tu and nothing really happens. 2) I don't like this version of Luke. It doesn't feel like him at all. Even Mark Hamill said it. 3) While I did enjoy some of the gags, a lot of them felt out of place. Like, they interrupted good action sequences or felt awkwardly placed. What's with Luke milking that space cow? Did we really have to see that?  4) There isn't a single lightsaber duel. We are teased with it but it doesn't happen. 5) Rose? Get out of here...<br/><br/>All in all, I think it boils down to Rian Johnson wanting to subvert expectations: "Ho ho, they'll think this is the big lightsaber duel of the movie, but nooooo", "After all the theorizing they'll never guess Rey's parents were nobody", etc, etc. It's too much and doesn't respect the predecessor. There are a couple of positives: BB-8 - I love this droid so much. I love the final battle and the Throne Room fight, and how about the hyperspeed crash? Wow! Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are awesome. I didn't like Kylo Ren that much in TFA but I thought this movie put him in a new light and I'm excited to see where his character goes from here. Some of the cinematography is breathtaking - this is probably the most beautiful looking Star Wars movie ever. I did like the Porgs, I thought they were very cute. I did get the feeling through-out the movie I didn't know who was gonna survive and that's a rare accomplishment! It did a good job building fear and uncertainty. Here's to hoping JJ can get Part IX and Star Wars back on track. I wonder if he's pissed that so much of his setups and work in VII were completely obliterated in VIII?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Also I don't remember Star Wars having such a weak set of villians - Kylo Ren - fair enough could have potential but NEVER as a leader -General Hux...? very weak when compared to previous like Tarkin and the 'comedy moment' between him and Kylo Ren were cringy...  and I realise sometimes change is needed with characters but old characters have made Star Wars what it is today so they must have done something right...where are the bad-ass bounty hunters? where are the sith lords? Get George Lucas involved to sort it out!<br/>I just don't see where they are trying to take Star wars after watching TLJ,but to turn it around for me they will have to surprise us with some epic characters and story lines  in any future episodes....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie is terrible. It doesn't fit into any of the other movies. Logically the movie falls apart worse than any other Star Wars movie yet. Most of the movie centers around a rebel (I won't call it resistance, that was a stupid and unnecessary name change from The Force Awakens) group of transports that are running out of gas getting chased by the Empires most powerful fleet. Don't ask me why but apparently the imperial fleet has nothing that is faster than rebellion transports and their tie fighters seem to all be broken down at once.<br/>If you ever wanted to see Luke Skywalker milk an alien. Then this movie will cover that base. If you want to see General Leia surrounded by a bunch of women to make modern feminist happy this movie has you covered. If you want virtue signaling about how awful rich people are this movie has you covered. At one point Leia busts through a door by using the force. When this happens you will expect the spice girls to run into the room and yell GIRL POWER. You will also get to see Leia fly through space like Superman. Because that is exactly what every Star Wars fan has wanted for 30 years. What you won't get is an amazing lightsaber battle featuring Luke. You will get to see a bunch of AT-AT's fire at a projection of Luke, though. Because that is what we've all been waiting for since the Return of the Jedi. Did I mention this movie is awful?<br/>If you wanted an actual Star Wars movie that embraced the spirit of the original then do not see this movie. This is a Disney movie. For some reason, they felt the need to pepper every serious scene there is in the movie with awful humor. The movie opens with one X-Wing flying right up to the imperial fleet. For some reason instead of blowing up the X-Wing, the Admiral of the imperial fleet starts arguing with Poe. I actually thought I was watching a bad commercial. I could not believe this was the start of a Star Wars movie. This is a modern Matrix Reloaded. Every fan theory or idea that you had about this movie is better than what you will see. I feel like I waited 30 years to watch Luke Skywalker milk an alien. I have never left any movie shaking my head but that is exactly what I did when I left this movie. Star Wars is dead. Disney sucked the life out of it. You'll be begging for George Lucas to make the next movie after seeing this. The prequels look like a golden age compared to this monstrosity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

No to this, this new trilogy is not a part of the Star Wars Canon. If i had the power i never would let this movie go into the cinema. if i had the power i would scrub the next Episode.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7945572"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I'm very disappointed as a Star Wars fan. I left the theater feeling numb. The franchise has been officially ruined by Disney, and turned into a Marvelesque movie where jokes abound, and nothing is taken too seriously, especially the bad guys. The Star Wars mythos is dumbed down, marginalized and made fun of; nothing really seems to matter or have gravity anymore, as Rey says of the force, "power . . . that makes things float.", gone are the wise words of Obi-wan Kenobi, and Jedi Master Yoda. I long for the wooden acting of the prequels, for at least they kept true to Star Wars. The Force Awakens made me optimistic for the new trilogy, and The Last Jedi ended my optism while ruining the character arcs that were set up in the in number 7. In the opening scene we have an inappropriate use of humour from Poe Dameron directed at General Hux which makes the villians comical and make them less menacing. Imagine the same happening to Darth Vader in the original trilogy. Following the humor Poe makes fun of General Hux's skin color, calling him pasty. Imagine if the same was said about a black person? It's okay to make fun of white males today. Everyone else is off limits because you'll be accused of racism or sexism, or some other ism. I typically wouldn't care about such a comment, because I'm not that sensitive, but it infuriates me because of the double standard.<br/><br/>As I said, the character arcs were destroyed from The Force Awakens. Rey who I really enjoyed as a character in the first movie turns out to have been sold off by her junk dealer parents. This removes all the mystery from Rey, and makes it impossible to accept how perfect she is. She knows the force extremely well and can use a lightsaber without an ounce of training, but there is absoloutely no reason for it, it just is. No where in the Star Wars universe does that occur, even with the virgin brith of Anakin Skywalker; he himself had to learn before he became a great Jedi.<br/><br/>I liked Rey so much in the first movie, and now I no longer care where her story ends up. They did nothing to advance the character. Following that failure, Kylo Ren kills Supreme Leader Snoke before we have a chance to learn anything about him. This character was set up to be super powerful in the TFA, and here in TLJ we have him show his massive power by knocking Hux to the ground as a hologram, and he plays with Kylo and Rey, yet he can't feel Kylo Ren moving and preparing Luke's lightsaber next to him to dismember him. It's amazing. What's the point?<br/><br/>The characters go nowhere in the movie, and neither does the story. Finn is another character who has wasted potential. They send him off with the new character Rose to the casino planet to find a code breaker who will help break the tracking device the New Order has on the Resistance's capital ship, which allows the fist order to track them through hyperspace. This mission is pointless, and feels like filler. It didn't feel like Star Wars to me, and there was commentary on animal abuse, and child abuse which also felt out of place in a Star Wars movie. The way Luke was handled was aggregious. Here is the man who went on a suicide mission to turn his father Darth Vader in the Return of the Jedi, but here we find out he was thinking of killing his nephew because he felt the darkside in him. This is the same man who was a new hope in the original trilogy, and here we find him turning his back on his family and friends, wanting to destroy the history of the Jedi, and being bested by Rey because feminism now rules in Disney Star Wars, and all males are idiots.<br/><br/>There is so much wrong with this movie, that it's hard to keep it short. The final stab in the heart is the Leia giving up on her son, Luke projecting himself and the dying from exertion did me completely, and Rey moving rocks to save what's left of the resistance when Luke said earlier that the force isn't just about moving rocks, but there you go. Wouldn't it have been nicer if he at least trained her to move the rocks and we had a payoff, and he raised his x-wing from under the water to show up in the last battle instead of using this new force power of astral projection. I don't know where this trilogy is going, but I don't care to see this movie again nor the next in the series. I'm sure we'll see the same agenda applied to Solo and Episode 9. Han Solo won't be able to get anyting done unless a small attractive female shows him the way.<br/><br/>I guess fans like me are old news. This is now the age of politically correct, feminist, Disney marvel Star Wars. It's time for me to move on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

NO!!! Too many unanswered questions that leave you to ask more question at the end of the movie. I'm sorry to say that I would not want to see another Star Wars movie again. This rating should have been a 0 but I do give a 1 because of Mark Hamill.<br/>P.S. If you want to watch a real Star Wars Movie watch  the original Star Wars 4, 5, and 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Lots of stories that were mostly pointless with only Rey and Kylo having anything worthwhile going on. Kylo was improved overall. The whole ship chase was incredibly dull. Cut out the Poe, Rose, and Finn stories and it would have been a better movie. Didn't see a reason to go killing the old guard off, was looking forward to seeing a re-energized Luke. R2 was there with Luke but used only for like 1 scene, there should have been a bit more emotion there but it fell pretty flat. Other than Rey and Kylo the new characters are not working for me at all.<br/><br/>It also seems disney was really hoping those little bird things they made would do great as merchandise as they are everywhere(many on sale in stores), quite literally added to the film to be merchandise. Doing things like that seems pretty scummy to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The bloated cast of uninspired new characters, coupled with the nonsensical portrayals of Luke and Leia drove a plot that lacked direction and was at times, baffling to watch unfold. The writing team failed to exhibit even a basic comprehension of the lore of Star Wars and the overuse of awkward, ham-fisted humour greatly detracted from my immersion and belied the supposed 'dark' tone the film was attempting to convey. All in all, while there were some entertaining action set pieces, the story decisions made in this film are baffling and have severely hamstrung J.J. Abrams' ability to make a well-rounded, satisfying film to conclude this new trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I am a die hard Star Wars fan and this was a huge disappointment after Force Awakens and Rogue One.  It is just a bad movie, period.  Disjointed storyline, cliched, cheesy, unexplained actions by major characters.  Wont go into spoilers but there were basically 2 scenes in the movie that I thought were worthwhile. I actually laughed out loud at points (unfortunately they were not parts of the movie that were meant to be funny) a throwback to what happened to me during Phantom Menace. Don't waste your money or listen to critics, who I can only assume were either paid off by Disney or just afraid to speak the truth</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The acting is good, the budget is up on the screen, some jokes work.<br/><br/>Some don’t, and the plot is nonsensical.  It’s too long and there’s easily 45mins of film you could cut that would make it better.  It does a deconstruction of Luke Skywalker and teaches him a valuable lesson with a Disney quote.  Nobody wants to see that.<br/><br/>The biggest flaws, besides the plot that makes little sense, is how it mistreats the heroes and villains.  Luke and Rey are mishandled, Luke is given a hollow and contrived story.  He tries teaching Rey but it’s worthless.  He changes his mind cause he saw a video.  He dies cause the movie is over.  Rey is set up pretty good in the last movie and turns out to be a crazy liar in this movie.  How that makes her a hero I don’t know, it just makes her insane.<br/><br/>Snoke is killed in a stupid way that makes him look weak.  Kylo is ultimately reduced to his worst traits, a sniveling brat making horrible decisions.  He gets tricked by something that shouldn’t have tricked him.  He keeps the backstabbing red headed general alive for quite literally no reason, in fact he should have every reason to murder him and elevate the next guy.<br/><br/>Not speaking as a Star Wars fan, just as someone who cares about good writing, story, cohesive plots and solid filmmaking.  This isn’t it.  Consider the number of times the movie has BB8 outright murder people or save the heroes.  Consider the number of times the movie does plot twists just for plot twist sake.  Consider the number of times the movie dips directly into prequel territory with goofy, cartoony high-speed CGI “action sequences”.<br/><br/>It needed a rewrite and reshoot, and cut nearly 1 hour.  2/10 might be too generous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Just go make a movie that has nothing to do with the Skywalkers. At least JJ Arbrams recycled garbage was watchable,  Rian Johnsons basically lit his garbage on fire then sat back to watch it burn! There was some awesome cinematic scenes and some good acting, but the story didnt even seem thought out, as if the director was just making it up on the fly and hoping it would all work out in the end. I do enjoy the new characters and they could have blended them with the old characters in a way that was fresh.  They could of moved away from having the same evil empire trying to take over and rebels fighting back that they have done for every star wars movie.  TLJ has so many plot holes it seems to be trying to top TFA plot holes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Corny love stories, poor lines and poor acting as in Episode 2 and 3 are forgivable, cringeworthy, but forgivable. A Terrible character like Jar-Jar Binks in Episode 1, while horrible in his own respect, at least had development, a back story and a compelling quirk (oddly lucky clumsiness which led people to speculate about what it means to be force sensitive). But this movie... This movie wasn't what I would call "bad" more so than a slap in the face for any new and old Star Wars fan.<br/><br/>No this isn't a gripe about the awkward diversity of characters (the stuttering Codebreaker was actually refreshing.). What irritates me is that there is no compelling character development. There is literally none. Rey doesn't learn any real lesson from Luke and decides to act rashly and impulsively. Her punishment? Ren kills Snoke. Ok? I know this is meant to be a big turn for Ren, but this isn't foreshadowed, it isn't built up. Snoke was never developed into a compelling or threatening character so his death just feels flat...<br/><br/>Another big problem is the Codebreaker plot. Why in God's name was this allowed to be in the movie? It's so far removed from the story that it makes no sense. Not only that but the whole thing was rendered pointless. The justification behind it was that a fusion powered interstellar warship was "running out of fuel" and couldn't escape because a DREADNOUGHT was tracing its location. What really bothers me about this is that Mon Cal cruisers are slower than Imperial Dreadnoughts and Tie Fighters are around 25x faster than them as well. A bomber fleet would have taken out the crippled ship in MINUTES. Also literally dropping bombs in space? LIKE WTF ARE YOU SMOKING? Leia surviving space for over 3 minutes? WTF?<br/><br/>Worst of all Luke was gutted as a character. I dont mind the nod to Yoda's character by turning him into the "scholar" type, but Luke, being the "Last Jedi," is the only living conduit for the light side of the force. That and his Skywalker blood would make him a literal God. Luke should have had a renewed vigor and faced Ren in person only to be outmatched by the only conduit of the dark side. Imagine Luke deflecting walker lasers with one hand and force crushing another set with his other as Luke deflects the barage towards Ren's walker Ren stops the lasers in place one after the other as he yells in a fit of rage (a potentially visually striking scene with time for a flashback to Luke's intended murder of Ren), ignites his lightsaber and jumps out of the walker (the walker explodes while he leaps towards Luke, letting the suspended lasers continue their original path. In the aftermath, a lightsaber fight begins.<br/><br/>And here's another thing I dont understand why the lightsaber battles have been denigrated. Lucas used them as a plot device to create tension during dramatic character development. Sadly this movie lost ALL TENSION and FAILED TO DEVELOP ITS CHARACTERS. IT FOCUSED ON HUMOR, VISUALS AND IRRELEVANT POLITICAL JABS (ie the casino scenes). IT ALSO BUTCHERS ALREADY DEVELOPED CHARACTERS BY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THEIR MOTIVATIONS. TL:DR the movie is poorly directed, poorly written, ignorant of even the most basic of Star Wars lore, and, above all, I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth with nothing answered and no desire to see another Star Wars movie. I've never felt like that before about Star Wars even the trash of the prequels was better! I wish this movie was never made! I take is back this IS a "bad" movie 0/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is apparent that Disney want to take the essence of the Skywalker Saga and end it and they are not even ensuring that these beloved characters get their due. They are trying to shove all these new characters down our throat, but are refusing to even give us 5 reasons to care for these new 'heroes', who have so much screen time in sub-plots that have zero impact on the actual narrative. If the Expanded Universe was wiped out to give us this crap, I think genuine Star Wars fans have a right to be very very angry. Big Corporations cannot just take over a mega franchise like Star Wars, wipe out every single expanded universe story and then replace it with run of the mill garbage that has been made just so that it ticks a few corporate checkboxes.<br/>Fans need to reclaim Star Wars, before this Disney Behemoth turns it into another Marvel franchise. I actually feel hurt and let down as someone who grew up with Star Wars. There is not one scene or location in this movie that can even compare to Jabba's Palace. Not one character that has the complexity of Jabba. Honestly, the Phantom Menace was better than this movie and it is unfortunate that critics have been paid off by Disney to certify this movie as authentic Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie is objectively horrible; filled to the brim with plot holes, underdeveloped characters, continuity errors that completely negate any plot relevancy it's preceding movie had, and unforgivably lazy writing. Every man in this movie is a whiny, **** baby and every woman is an over-powered, condescending, egotistical, Mary Sue. This movie reeks of political messages and shameless misandry. The writers of this movie completely butcher any and all Star wars canon to the point of utter irrelevancy; in no way does this movie deserve to be a Star Wars movie, much less a sci-fi B-movie. Save your hard-earned money, do not watch this movie in theaters, do not rent this movie later, pirate this piece of s**t so not a dime goes to the creators of this abhorrent, insulting, revolting, pile of trash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Many questions not answered, villians killed much too soon, no real dogfight at the end of the movie, unnessessary and boring plotlines (Canto Bight - looks like a spin-off from 5th Element, has no Star Wars feeling!), Leia as a superhero-astronaut in space... what a mess! RJ was too bold in making this movie being different and "fresh". Well, it was provocative and shocking, thats true... I wont be watching Episode 9, even the prequel trilogy deserved the title "Star Wars" more than this movie. In my personal universe, SW ends with episode 6, for me there is no 7-9. And maybe some spin-offs ... Rogue One was nice! What a shame, RJ killed the sequel trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This film takes some incredible risks, deviating from a typical narrative structure, expanding the lore of Star Wars, and ends up not only emulating its predecessors but surpassing them. The Last Jedi is subversive of expectations in some of the ballsiest ways imaginable. Rey, Kylo Ren, and Luke absolutely steal the show, and the minor plotlines, which at first glance seem largely dispensable, culminate in a very poignant and pointed ending that looks toward the future with fresh new eyes and new hopes.

Some magical moments like reunion scenes i.e. Luke & R2, Chewie & Luke, Luke & Yoda that were genuine & heartfelt. “Some” of the humour was on point and there were moments of shear brilliance.<br/>TFA was branded a rehash of previous films and even though I would agree at least the story was coherent and made sense, the character development was satisfying and it set things up perfectly in regards to paying respectful homage to the past and creating mystery for the future.TLJ is a victim of trying too hard to be what it needs to be “Original” and “Unpredictable” and in trying so hard to be these things it falls flat on every single hurdle.<br/>TFA paid respectful homage to the original films carefully balancing the humour with serious moments. TLJ literally tries to rewrite these rules, making it come across as more like a spoof. The scene where Luke throws the saber over his shoulder could have been taken straight from an episode of the Simpson's, General Hux was turned into a bad stand up comedian repeating the same jokes over and over. There were a few really odd moments in TLJ, the one that springs to mind first and foremost is the character that should have been handled with so much care, because the actress is no longer with us. There were at least two moments in the movie in which could have been used to respectfully send off this character, but instead they decided to turn these ideal moments into missed opportunities and awkward situations. Princess Leia was quite literally turned into superman which was such a strange moment and very awkward. Not only did this make literally no sense at all considering Leia never had any Jedi training prior, it was such a disrespect to the character and talented actress whom is no longer with us.Luke milking a huge sea cow like walrus and drinking it,with a wink to the camera like it had been taken from an advert was again a scene that belonged in an episode of the Simpson's. Rey was one of the great characters developed in TFA,she worked really well with the character Kylo Ren she saw this character murder his own father in TFA,yet in this movie she is getting all hot and bothered by seeing him with no top on!<br/>The majority of the movie was one big chase,entertaining from a visual/effects side of things,but it didn’t make a great deal of sense.The Maz Kanata snippet could have been taken straight from a video game,its almost like they needed to include this character and couldn’t come up with how to, so they did this just to include the character.Whilst the Canto Bite segment was in theory a great concept,the execution was all wrong,the entire scene felt like it was from a completely different movie,completely unnecessary and waste of half an hour,the time could have been utilised developing other characters that so desperately needed it.The Finn and Rose romance was unengaging and did not resonate.<br/>TFA set up things so well for an eventual pay off in subsequent films. Snoke was a powerful character probably one of the most villainous characters ever. Yet he gets killed so simply that just makes you gasp in annoyance. Rey again such an important character in this new trilogy set up so well in TFA in regards to her parentage mystery and could of turned out to be anybody.Yet they decided to go with an overwhelming bombshell that she is a little orphan mary sue whom parents sold her for drug money.<br/>Rey's training barely happened yet we are lead to believe she is now a fully fledged Jedi by the end of the movie. Showing Luke's X-wing submerged makes no sense unless he was going to raise it up out of the water at some point during the movie and use it to fly and save the day as Jedi Master Luke – but it never happened. Instead he decided to use his force abilities to project himself.<br/>BB8 is the new R2-D2 that much is for certain but it made no sense to bring R2-D2 back to life purely to give us the map to find Luke or to remind Luke of the good O'l times.Everyone anticipated the return of Luke Skywalker, but the way they treated his character was a complete lack of respect.We are lead to believe Luke did not want to be found and went to the island to die,yet why did he plant/hide the segment of the map so that he could be found,it feels at times like director Rian Johnson didn’t even take the time to watch the previous movies before writing this one. Luke was willing to sacrifice himself in order to bring his father back to the light side,yet we are lead to believe that this is the same character whom is willing to murder his own nephew all because he senses a little darkness in him.<br/>An entertaining film but leave your brain at home,but a hugely disappointing Star Wars Movie that does not deliver on anything that was promised in the previous instalment and pays little respect to the overall Star Wars Legacy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The jokes were forced, overused, and shouldnt have been in the serious parts of the movie. The only reason the Porgs were in the movie was for quick marketing money grab.The only good actors in the movie fell flat, and the only good characters that were in the movie were wasted completely. This film was a travesty. Rian Johnson should be ashamed of what he single-handedly did to ruin this franchise. If this is any indication of where this Star Wars franchise is heading, I for one will never watch another, and I have been a life long fan.

This is just an attemp to recover a 4 Billion investment from Disney buying the rights for SW. Forget about the magic, the force, and everything that stood for the Jedi ways.<br/><br/>The movie itself is not a "bad" movie, but ladies and gentlemen, this is NOT STAR WARS.<br/><br/>I do not look forward to Ep. IX, I will not go to a movie theater to watch it. This is the end.

However, the backlash back-and-forth between critics and audiences has been fascinating. So why are critic scores so high and audience scores so low?<br/><br/>Two words: Rian Johnson. Not necessarily Rian Johnson the director, but Rian Johnson the  person. From what I can gather, Johnson is an awesome guy. He’s kind, dignified, accessible… everything most big-budget directors are not. He has built personal relationships with critics, bloggers and podcasters like no other director working today. Many people in the film-criticism world are actual friends of his, and many others feel like they could be friends should the opportunity arise.<br/><br/>So imagine you’re a critic, invited to the world-premiere of one of the most anticipated movies in history. Not only are you basically friends with the director, amazed that the guy you interviewed years ago after “Brick” has now directed a Star Wars movie, you’re also rubbing elbows with some of today’s biggest movie stars, all while being enveloped in the Disney hype machine. Think you might see The Last Jedi through rose-colored glasses? I think you might, and I think many did.<br/>The only critic I’ve seen broach this view so far is the always-great Joanna Robinson at Vanity Fair. I think other critics need to take a step back and see if their view has been clouded by how much they love Johnson.<br/><br/>I was so excited when it was announced Johnson would be directing The Last Jedi. I loved Looper. That movie had swagger. The Last Jedi does not have swagger. Don’t get me wrong, Johnson is still a great guy, even if The Last Jedi is not up to snuff.<br/><br/>One last thing: The Last Jedi lost me early. I haven’t seen anyone else mention this, but there’s a shot in the first few minutes of the film where a couple of Resistance fighters are walking on the surface of the planet that’s being attacked. There’s a huge (green screen) explosion RIGHT BEHIND THEM and they’re just walking casually and almost jokingly asking each other if they should evacuate. It was an early bad omen for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

At times this movie felt like a fun ride, only to have the credits role with a dozen hot story holes. Oh but don't worry, I am sure you will be able to sell lots of your chicken Ewoks to kids this Christmas. Get out of here. There has clearly been no concise vision for this trilogy. A new movie does not need to be pumped out every year, take time and make it quality. Now I have to go back to the theater and see it again just to confirm my anger is justified. So don't think that high attendance means its good. And who are these critics saying the movie was 100?? Cowards, just because the franchise says Star Wars they need to claim its great, otherwise they risk being ridiculed in their own community. That's why I had to add my 2 cents, it is garbagio.  The only positive thing to come out if it all is Daisy Ridley, for that I thank you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The plot and its execution in the film was awful and it made Luke and Leia's characters have far less influence on the film than they should have had. New characters are introduced so suddenly, and their acting is forced very badly, and one new character in particular really, really gets on my nerves. Carry Fisher and Mark Hamil managed to save a very, very small amount of this movie's integrity with their acting skills, but sadly the executives behind this movie made the film so bad that not even Mark and Fisher could save it. With that out of the way, I'll explain why I can't stand this movie:<br/><br/>1) The plot<br/><br/>In order for you to understand why I dislike the plot and its execution in the film so much, I'll have to explain something from the past first. Remember the original films? Remember how in A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi there was a perfect balance between conflict and elaboration on the plot? There was always a right time to have a space battle, a lightsaber duel, or a a clash between two armies, and then there was always a right time to have characters like Obi-Wan and Yoda to deepen the plot. It was a perfect balance. In this film, all of this is poorly executed. The action scenes did a great job at being action scenes, of course, but many of the characters themselves were awful at trying to make the audience care about them. EVERYTHING in this film is rushed, including scenes restricted to just dialogue!<br/><br/>Basically, this movie's plot starts with the good guys, being the Resistance, trying to escape their home base from the bad guys, being the First Order, who are out to completely destroy the good guys. The good guys escape, but then this turns into an on-going chase as the First Order's fleet tries to completely obliterate the Resistance. In between the main plot, we have Rey trying to learn to become a Jedi, and Finn going on a very cringy adventure with a new character that literally adds nothing to the story, but more on that later. The film then ends in a final battle on the planet of Crait between the Resistance and the First Order. You'll understand why the plot is so badly executed in my next points.<br/><br/>2) Mark Hamil's role as Luke Skywalker has been handicapped by bad writing.<br/><br/>Luke Skywalker, along with Leia were undoubtedly highly anticipated characters in this film. Sadly for Luke, however, is the fact that his character has been reduced to a bitter, pessimistic old man living as a hermit. Also, he ends up being a heavily flawed character with poor moral judgement and appears to be incompetent. You'd think that a Jedi Like Luke would have become wiser and very, very powerful, but with great restraint. I pictured him as being more noble. In essence, Luke is angry about the past. What Luke essentially did leading up to the plot of this film was resurrecting the Jedi Order, only to end up having it go right back to near extinction, and he's now a bitter old man who thinks he did all of this for nothing. You'd think he'd manage to show strong resolve like Yoda, but naturally that's not the case. The plot makes him look worthless. What's even worse is the fact that his character is flawed, because out of fear and contempt he tried to kill Kylo Ren in his sleep, when he was still a student in the Jedi Temple. A Jedi like Luke, who managed to defeat Vader and restore balance to the force (although temporarily), one who was always hopeful despite the odds, has been reduced to a sniveling, insecure wimp. To add insult to injury, Luke Skywalker loses a fight to Rey, who is supposed to be completely inexperienced in the Force and is a beginner at best. Now we see that Luke is not only an insecure wimp, he's also an insecure wimp who cannot adequately defend himself in combat, despite the fact that he has been studying the ways of the Force for years, and even managed to resurrect the Jedi Order. Why couldn't the writers just allow him to defeat Rey? Obviously with great restraint, of course, since he is a Jedi, and Jedi should be good.<br/><br/>2) Carrie Fisher's character, being Leia, is also handicapped by the plot.<br/><br/>Leia should have been commanding the Resistance fleet in the entire movie. But no, she has to be unconscious through a large portion of the film and replaced by a new character, who is completely subpar, hesistant and incompentent, until she finally regains consciousness.<br/><br/>3) Rose Tico, a new character, is awful and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Rose Tico is a new character that you probably can't stand. All she is is a character who works on pipes, is socially awkward, and suddenly meets Finn and thinks her life has changed because she had a conversation with a war hero. Once again, forced, awful acting makes her a character that I really dislike, much like Jar Jar. Also, she makes a really stupid decision to save Fin at the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Slapstick, lazy insult humor, and distractingly out-of-place modern vernacular threaten to tip the balance to all out farce, until the film jarringly goes for pathos with a subversive take on the Star Wars mythos that is at first refreshing but ultimately too convoluted and contradictory to warrant more than an indifferent head scratch. The detailed production design and cutting-edge special effects are as impressive as ever, but all in service of an uneven story that shuffles interchangeable characters around new-but-familiar backdrops. Mysteries are introduced as quickly as they're swept under the rug. The conflict never really goes deeper than a simple take on 'good vs. evil' or 'young vs. old' (The implicit ageism in this movie, in traditional Disney fashion, is off the charts.) Old and new characters randomly pop up (sometimes literally and inexplicably) to rattle off clunky exposition and hoary declarations. Despite some intriguing gestures towards an internal battle brewing within the protagonist and antagonist, such complexities are quickly diffused with on-the-nose dialogue that relies on telling rather than showing. It's hard to care about the mysteries, conflicts, and mythologies that are woven through the story when characters repeatedly stop the action to explain away everything in increasingly literal and tone-deaf terms.  This makes for easy, accessible entertainment, but it's constantly undercutting any semblance of drama, suspense, or cinema, a few gorgeous set pieces and locales not-withstanding. Entire subplots (something about a Master Codebreaker?) and characters could have easily been left on the cutting room floor, allowing for a more focused and purposeful movie. It's as if the filmmakers made the mistake of conflating running time with "epicness," rather than work to make each scene build to a cohesive whole. The film is easily 30-minutes too long, which turns the beautifully-staged climactic battle into an exhausting and perfunctory coda rather than the culmination of 40-years of meticulous world-building. The film seems like a grab bag of ideas, gags, archetypes, and plotpoints that the filmmaker/studio was too enamored with to let go of, but not diligent enough to fully integrate into a compelling story. Ultimately, like the prequel trilogy, this movie probably works best if you turn the sound off and just appreciate the design and technology behind the visuals.  I was skeptical about the surprisingly low user score this movie is getting across the board, as it reeked of sour grapes from the fanboy brigade, but after seeing the movie for myself, I get the reaction. The film is perfectly mediocre and passable and not really worth  the fuss.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm not big into the expanded universe nor do I care for the integrity of the lore but for **** sake how do you take potential plot elements from the first movie and completely toss them out the window.  Ya that Snoke guy who cares about him.  Rey's Parent's nah **** not interesting or important.  What you really want is a bitter old Luke trying to seclude himself while also succumbing to half assed jokes.  It's gotta be the blue bird/seal milk thats made him so demented.  Maybe all the Porg meat he has been eating.<br/><br/>What really did it in for me wasn't the peppered in jokes that fell flat on their faces during serious moments.  It was the numerous sub plots set up only for NONE of it to matter.  The only character that got any growth was Poe and that can be argued if it was genuine or not.<br/><br/>I think this movie can best be summarized as jumping off a cliff and not hitting the bottom.  There is still time to pull the chute and save the Trilogy but the speed in which they have accelerated to the bottom leaves little room left to pull the cord.  I can only hope Episode IX realizes its failures and really pulls something out of it's ass to close alot of these plot holes with something other than another Death Star.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie had some good things but overall I think it leaves the story in a terrible place. The Force Awakens catered to nostalgia while also bringing on new characters. The Last Jedi kills this nostalgia. First of all, I think that killing Han was a huge mistake and now Luke has been needlessly thrown away too. I was really hoping for a little bit of redemption when it appeared that Luke and Kylo Ren were in a standoff. But they went and ruined that by making Luke a weird force hologram thing which makes no sense. I hated the lack of lightsaber action. Don't get me wrong, I think episodes 1-3 had way too much and we became numb to it, but I don't even think two lightsabers even touched in this movie except for Lukes flashback of attempting to kill Ben in cold blood. I was hoping that TLJ was going to be the "Empire Strikes Back" of the new series. It not only didn't live up to that expectation but failed horribly as a sequel overall. They basically threw away everything that was good about TFA. TFA built up this unknown but extremely powerful villain, Snoke, but then TLJ killed him off in the dumbest way without explaining who he was or where he came from. They also built up that Rey's parents were of some importance but then threw that down the toilet and now any random street kid can have the force. And the whole Casino thing was completely out of place and didn't add anything to the overall story because it ended up being a useless journey.<br/><br/>There were some good things about it but overall it was a real disappointment and it ruined the momentum from TFA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Then I realized how bad the plot and supposed "brilliant ideas" this so-called genius "Rian Johnson" had, were. It may be a great movie. A great independent film. A great show for the new generation but it is a bad Star Wars movie. Period.<br/><br/>And I won't even get to the part that upset me most (my childhood hero) because I'd be spoiling it for you and I don't mean to do that. Though, if you're a fan. Stick to the 6-chapter saga and forget about Disney.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7941644"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">It completely dumps on all of the established lore from Episodes 1-6 on how one becomes powerful with the Force.In the original trilogy it is established that even though he is the heir to one of the most powerful Force wielders to have ever existed, a being that was literally created by the Force, that Luke must undergo rigorous training to wield the Force. In Disney Wars all of this is jettisoned out the airlock. Rey has been repeatedly referred to as a "Mary Sue". To be fair this is a slightly misogynistic and not entirely accurately description. She could have very well been a male character and her arc still would have been completely unbelievable. The problem is that despite the fact that she has grown up on a backwater planet with no training she is somehow all powerful. She instantly knows how to weild a light saber, Force influence people, and leviatate objects with no guidance. All of this despite the fact that it has already been established that even Anakin the most powerful Force user to ever come along had many years of training in the Jedi Order to develop his skills. Yet she can pilot the Millennium Falcon better than Han Solo, she can wield the Force better than Kylo Ren or even Luke for that matter. She ultimately has no character arc or character development of any kind because she is already complete when we first see her in TFA. Her character is the very definition of static and boring.<br/>The villains in Disney Wars are completely inept and bumbling and not at all menacing. Crying Ren is an angsty emo teen who looks like Napoleon Dynamite with a cape.(he should have just left the helmet on). He goes on and on about how his parents didn't love him enough and has comical temper tantrums that even cause his subordinates to not take him seriously. When Vader raged he would literally choke the life out of one of his bridge officers. They paid the ultimate price for their failures. Like I said before-- MENACING! General Sux is a punching bag who exists soley as a whipping boy for Snoke and Kylo Ren. Brienne of Tarth I mean Captain Phasma is a character that gets utterly owned by the heroes in TFA. She gives up the Starkiller Base codes with nary a struggle. She is then somehow welcomed back into the First Order and shows up in TLJ only to be completely owned again this time by Finn. She literally has about 3 minutes of screen time I think. What was the point in having her as a character? Snoke is a complete copy and paste of Palpatine and has no backstory. He is ultimately just a place holder in these movies. A guy who was waiting to be killed so that Napoleon Dynamite could take over the First Order. When your villains are not menacing and scary it kills any sense of suspense.<br/>The plot is basically non-sensical dues ex machina crap. The fleet is being chased by The First Order and is running out of fuel? Since when has that ever been an issue in these movies? So they spend the majority of the film on an extended chase scene that ended up being completely boring. Finn and Rose go to a Casino world where they are supposed to meet up with some code breaker that will get them on board the First Order's Dreadnought but then meet some random guy (Benecio Del Toro) and actually TRUST him! How stupid can they be?! Of course he ends up betraying them ultimately.<br/>This movie portrays Luke as a complete coward defying all characterizations of him established in previous episodes.. We are supposed to believe that Luke, a guy who immediately went to save his friends on Cloud City after having a Force premonition in ESB is now content to sit in a hut on an island while his friends and family are decimated by the First Order? Also we are supposed to believe that Luke, a guy who attempted to save his father from the dark side in ROTJ to the point that he laid down his arms and was prepared to self sacifice himself for the cause was going to murder his nephew because he felt the dark side dwelling in him? WTF? lt was a lousy and badly contrived characterization of Luke.<br/>Near the end of the film Admiral Purple Haired Wig saves the day by flying a cruiser into the First Order's Dreadnought in hyperspace which COMPLETELY OBLITERATES IT and most of their fleet. Guess that the Resistance should have just done that from the get go instead of stupidly letting their ships get picked off one by one. Oh and why the hell didn't they let Admiral Ackbar a known and beloved SW character make the sacrifice instead? At least then the scene would have had some emotional resonance.<br/>At the end Luke becomes One with the Force but why? How did he die at the end? Did he have a Force-related aneurysm? This is never explained. He just disappears into his robes ala Obi Won/Yoda style after doing astral Force projection across the galaxy. Lazy writing and plot holes you could pilot a Star Destroyer through. The Force is weak with this one. One point for good production values.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I´m an all time Star Wars fan since I saw The Return of the Jedi on the movies back in the 80´s. Each and every movie has been a wonderful experience for me, and for my kids, who became fans themselves with the prequels. Say what you want about them, but they were entertaining and captivating for kids. But enough of the backstory. THIS MOVIE WAS A DISASTER. I mean, it was beautifully made, the cinematography was gorgeous, but the story and the storytelling was pure and absolute CRAP. Rian Johnson and whoever wrote the script managed to tear apart everything we grew up admiring about Star Wars, turning Luke Skywalker, the same Luke Skywalker who abandoned his training to save his friends in Cloud City, the same Skywalker who turned the most badass villain in the whole universe into the light side, the same Skywalker, well you get my point, they manage to turn him into a bitter wimp who won´t get his hands dirty even for his twin sister.  They fail to reveal the source of all mighty powerful Rey´s powers, they fail to explain Patricide Kylo Ren motives, heck, they even fail to explain who the hell is Snoke, who at time feels more powerful than every Sith before him.  The movie is a mess, and only screws us by taking our greatest heroes in the galaxy and turning them to nothing.  I´m beyond words to explain what a mess this movie created.  BTW, kudos to JJ Abrams, who managed to create the least likeable and reedemable villain in Kylo Ren. I mean, Anakin/Vader´s story was great, because he was as great a hero as he was a villain, he saved as many lives as he killed, but he NEVER did anything to the point we could think was unredeemable. (not even killing younglings). He really became Vader when he tought he had killed Padme and his child by mistake, but we knew different. He saved Luke when he was about to die. But Kylo is a freaking patricide who killed his father in cold blood and saw his mother blow into space and did nothing. JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson only needed to make him a paedophile priest to make him the most unredeemable person EVER. So, it´s not as we are waiting for him to turn to the light, we COULDN´T CARE LESS if he was hanged by the balls by all eternity.  Way to go screenwriters !!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I laughted only one time. Well lets summarize it:<br/><br/>- Trying to be different, new and not to copy previous episodes doesn't mean that You put in so much nonsence which doesn't feel natural. Leia throwed to the space, ruined with superman power and then colapses. What the hell was that? I mean sure, bring something new, but small portions with some developments in the SW world, don't throw sudden force gains and new powers which are just not feeling true to audience.<br/><br/>- Building up nice villain Snoke and then screwing it totaly up (like why Rey even went there? why Snoke even care to talk to her if he would want to kill her)...I mean yeah, if You want to make it as an illusion of Snokes death, that could only make some sence. But these illusional projections and plot twists are just not working in this movie. - Rose and Finn absolutely useless characters, nothing is working here...even waste of my time to say more about why .)) - Poe nice entry, useless mid and end time<br/><br/>- General Hux, his essence from EP7 was ruined, an Imperial Jar Jar Binks now....WE DONT NEED TO LAUGHT TO STUPID JOKES, we would like to have some strong dark characters!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>- Captain Phasma failed again, total waste of screen time, I mean if You want to insta kill all interesting characters from the negative side, I am not buying it. You are making a movie for 10y old kids, not fans.<br/><br/>- Kylo Ren, I had problem with Kylo in EP7, but this time...its worse. I understand that he might be divided or even just playing out divided character, but ....so much nonsence in his behaviour...its really too much to absorb.<br/><br/>- Luke. Forget it. In this movie there is no Luke Skywalker. This character is just some pathetic attempt to get Mark out from next movies. I don't know if Director of Disney are behind it, but its over. This is one of the major fails of the movie.<br/><br/>BAD WRITING, USELESS SCENES (Casino line), UNLOGICAL moments (which are even for SW too much).<br/><br/>NO, THIS is NOT a SW Movie. This is an error. R.Johnson is nice guy, but please don't touch SW again please. I am done. I can't say more.....what a disaster.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Glaring pot holes, cringeworthy attempts at humour and a real waste of some great actors and their characters. Much worse than the prequels in many ways. Loved the visuals and ship design especially Kylo's Tie. Some interesting themes e.g. Is it better to save lives or kill bad guys?

I genuinely wished I didn't have to write this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
