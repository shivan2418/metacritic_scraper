Articles, interviews, reviews, recaps and so on invite you to treat every movie as a major cultural milestone or religious experience. What they are is fairly okay big budget action movies. If you liked the Force Awakens you'll like this pretty much sums it up. If you're looking for a bold new direction you're out of luck. The movie holds a few surprises but it all feels pretty safe without getting too wacky or sentimental.<br/><br/>The best part is the visuals, there are several big fights that we're crazy cool. I like the mix of CGI and practical effects, with only a handful of cringe worthy CGI characters. The acting is pretty good, with much improved performances by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver who each seemed to have found the grove with their charters. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are stand outs with very moving turns as their classic characters. All this is done with the burden of what is easily the most disappointing part of the movie, the story. Where to start, well if you're a fan of Battlestar Galactica this might seem very familiar. I won't get into spoilers, just keep that in mind if you go see this. I will say it's all a mess. Things happen out of nowhere, nothing feels earned or happened with any kind of logical story progression in mind. The landscape of what's going on is very muddy and this wouldn't be an issue if the movie didn't try and make you feel like it was so important. Character motivation is unbelievable at best, everyone just does things cause they're cool, the movie in a strange self aware moment even points this out. I did really like some of the commentary on war itself, who really fights wars and who really benefits. It's a bold stand, especially in such a high budget people pleaser of a movie. I hope we see more of this in future movies. This all comes down to if you like Star Wars and the modren Star Wars movies so far you're going to like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Its made me laugh and cry intensely. At the very least it is a visually stunning masterpiece! Certain scenes left me utterly breathless. Most importantly, the core thesis of the film is so inherently what Star Wars is about and leaves both old and young with an inspirational lesson/ message: The fight is not about defeating your enemies, it's about saving those you love! This is the type of message I want my children learning.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

We see a lot of character growth with Rey and Kylo Ren. There are plenty of spectacular battles and action scenes, all of which are well-shot and well-choreographed. The pacing was weird, but not off-putting. A lot of people seem to be disappointing with Luke, but I think they did a great job with him. We see in him a person who was once a legendary do-gooder who to had his entire world shattered before his eyes. His cynicism shows in his interactions with Rey, and Mark Hamill does an excellent job expressing that cynicism (His voice sometimes dropping to get little hints of The Joker). The movie is not without its flaws though. There was a sub-plot involving a certain purple-haired woman that felt entirely unnecessary. Much of this sub-plot is the result of this character being an complete moron, and it largely served to distract from the overall story. There were also a few quips of "What the hell" and "God [not the force] be with you," which bothered me because up to this point it has felt like the Force occupies the cultural equivalent of god and hell, so why would these words be included in their lexicon? Lastly, and probably my biggest gripe, is Snoke. If you were hoping to learn anything about Snoke or his motivations, prepare for disappointment. Getting past all that, the movie is a blast. Forget everything you know about the old canon (something I thought everyone would have done by now given TFA and Rogue One), and go in expecting a fresh take on Luke and Leia.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I was smiling laughing in awe the whole movie. The amount of detail Rian give is heartwarming. Leia has the force in her....not to sure why you're surprised shes can wake up in space and use the force to save her life. The acting in the movie was perfectly fine. If their was on character that annoyed me the most it would of been Admrial Holdo the actress just didnt fit that role I know shes a well known actress but I just was not a fan. I thought Rose and Del Toros character were perfect and a great add on. I honestly see reviews where people make 0 sense talking about Disney and how they make their movies now and how there is comedy added....there was comedy in the original Star Wars movies lol. Also there is nothing wrong with laughing sorry you didnt laugh tho. How in the world can you compare this movie to the prequels lol HOW! I see people saying worst movie but 0 people are even explaining why? there a few of you but im searching and honestly there is nothing there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I was very satisfied with The Force Awakens and I was so excied to see more but Disney Disneyfied the whole thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Sure there are some boring side plots that don't wrap up extremely well. However, to say this movie is a 0-3 is simply untrue. This isn't a very bad movie, which that score would indicate. People need to realize just because this movie didn't unfold or hit their personal plot points that it is an extremely bad movie. You thinking it should've gone "this way or that way" doesn't make it a worthless piece of hot trash, as almost all these negative reviews are indicating. Expectations and presumptions lead to the dark side. Get over yourselves, your theories got debunked, move on, look to the stars and remember this is a middle trilogy movie, meant to subvert expectations and theories and leave loose threads and questions hanging. For everyone giving it undeservingly horrible reviews based on personal hubris, grow up, these aren't as bad as the prequels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is not perfect but it damn well isn't a 5.3 (as of writing this). I will get past the flaws of the movie first. Yes, it is long and the Finn and Rose Story line is pretty useless and we could have done without it. In addition to that some of the humor is kind of s**t. (Milk?) However, it has so many good aspects. SPOILERS PAST THIS LINE<br/>------------------------------------------<br/>So..... first things first. THe one complaint I universally see is the hate for Snokes death, saying it is a twist for the sake of twists and how they were spuer pissed and how he served no purpose. However, Snoke did serve a purpose, he seduced Kylo to the dark side, this movie and this trilogy isnt about the power of Snoke but rather the story of a conflicted, angry man who was born and raised in the light and has now been pulled towards the dark by this character. Not only is it a good twist but it represents something. It represents Kylo affirming his siding with the dark side but at the same time I feel that he might have chosen to kill him to avoid the tyranny that would have accompanied his rule over the empire. Secondly, people complain that at the dn of the movie nothoing has changed. I disagree here. Rey and Kylo are no longer the inherently good and inherently bad guys that we are used to in these films. Kylo is beginning to see the light and rey was pulled toward the dark. There is more a grey area forming and it is a fascinating thing to see. IN addition to that having Reys parents be nobodies shows how that anybody can be something, they can make a difference, you define who you are. This movie requires you to think and consider what has happened. It is nuanced. YOu cannot take it at face value as you can the other movies. It has subtle yet fascinating character arcs that are not completely obvious. To sum it up, this is where I think all the hate come from. People are taking it at face value but it is not a face value film, it requires thinking. It is not perfect but I think from a character standpoint this is the best star wars film of all time. It is intriguing, emotional, and also the fighting looks cool.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Its fun and enjoyable at points, but half of the time I would shrugging my shoulders and wincing at forced attempts at humor and terribly constructed pacing and scenes. Its clear Johnson and Kennedy & Co. dont really care to place an emphasis on good writing, dialogue, exposition, character/world building, or atmosphere. They just want to push out another tent pole movie with little care for the source. This franchise is on the way down the drain. Not unexpected, but sad to see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Yes, film looks great, special effects are awesome but uh... That's it. There is no depth in characters nor planets, lore even story itself seems... lacking. It feels like a cheap money grab similar to what's been happening to gaming industry. More and more content but less and less quality. Me, personaly I was hoping for engaging story, some answers and lore that would expand this universe. It's not there.<br/>I'm sorry but I'd rather watch Rouge One (with all it's plot holes and other issues) for 6th time than this again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This feels like the only thing that could have possibly followed something like episode 7 - the entire theme of the film was "Out with the old and in with the new" and the message wasn't just for the Galaxy, wasn't just for the franchise, but was also for us in our own society. I felt that the weakest point of the film was definitely the casino scenes, but I'm very sure they will tie this into a future plot and I was also thrilled to see more universe and lore expansion happening in a main series. I cannot wait for the final installment and part of me can't wait for the Skywalker stories to come to an end so we can see what else this rich universe can show us. To all for you out there who hated this film: Take a deep breath and remember that it wasn't ever about you anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This film shows the true power of the force, in the prequels the Jedi were weak and naive. However, it seems that many fans have not liked this. Rian Johnson did very good work and showed new things, but I think he should leave star wars, it's a dangerous place.

Yeah, it's REALLY that good. Anchored by some truly remarkable performances, and a host of good to great ones, the people are both more believable and more important than the effects, and the effects are amazing . Mark Hamill's turn as Luke Skywalker will be on my list of best performances of the year: he is funny, heart breaking, and legendary, it is the best acting this series has ever seen. Carrie Fisher's performance is wonderful, but the tragedy of her loss was impossible for me to separate, but it is a perfect farewell if it is her last appearance. The new heroes and villains carry the story and make it clear that the Force is still with Star Wars and the rebellion.  If you don't love this movie, you don't like Star Wars, you like the Star Wars you have in your head not the one that exists. A great movie on its own terms, The Last Jedi is without question either the best, or alongside The Empire Strikes Back, one of the best this series has given us. I can not wait to see it again and again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7845951"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This was the worst movie I've seen in a very long time.  You'd have to go back to Martin Lawrence's A Thin Line Between Love and Hate to do worse.  The plot was a jumbled and pointless mess.  90% of the movie could have been cut just by making the supposed "leader" Holdo do leaderly things and inform her crew at least of an idea of her plan.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>Very little.  Yoda was ok.<br/>The ships looked good.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>The dreadnought is getting beat down by a single X-Wing for several minutes and nobody thinks "Hey, we have all these other ships, let's go help it since it is a defenseless cannon platform."  The entire story ends right there with Poe's death if the First Order is more intelligent than Elmer Fudd.<br/><br/>Look at the men in the resistance.  They look mostly ragged, worn down, and desperate:  Exactly as they should when they've been running for their lives for days straight.  Now look at the women:  perfect hair done up, make up, not even a blemish.  They were incredibly unbelievable as always.  Hollywood only sees women as decorations and plays up their parts much more than they really are.  The best female actresses in this film get 1.  put in a coma or 2.  very little screen time and then killed at the end in the most idiotic and unfulfilling fashion ever.<br/><br/>Going back to the women, they are apparently the only good people left in the Galaxy.  Even Poe Dameron gets shown to be an overly cocky glory-whore for most of the film.  Luke Skywalker is a cowardly failure.  Finn can't do anything really and is just a guide for Rose throughout the film.  The bridge of the resistance cruiser, filled with the officers, is almost nothing but women, again with perfect hair, makeup, etc.  We get it, Disney.  You think you have the male market share wrapped around your finger so you're abandoning us to try and entice women to see your films more because the potential for more money lies in that demographic.  You're abandoning your base, though, and it'll be to your own injury.<br/><br/>Kylo Ren had 1 bad scene in the entire first movie but was otherwise great.  In that scene, he throws a temper tantrum and looks like a 12 year old that didn't get his PS4 for Christmas.  That Kylo Ren is all we see in TLJ.  He's completely nihilistic, angsty, and craving for attention.  Adam Driver was almost perfect in the first film and almost perfectly awful in the second.  The common thread in all of this filth isn't him though, it is a movie made by a Marketing Department.<br/><br/>Hey, Phasma is right here about to execute Finn and Rose...BOOM, big explosion, the room filled with hundreds of stormtroopers should be littered with bodies but instead there are maybe a dozen at most and...magic stormtrooper powers have now placed Phasma and 10 or so of her soldiers a football field away and in formation.  Oh, and the guy shooting at Rose never thinks to fire a single shot at Finn, even after Rose sought cover and Finn stood there as a big beautiful target.<br/><br/>Absolutely nothing from the first movie is ever answered.  Even the question of Rey's parentage is up in the air as Ren could have been lying to her to manipulate her.  Who knows?  I don't think that's the case, but with all of the annoying diversionary writing and inverse Star Wars tropes in this film, you have no idea what is real and what isn't.  Snoke, the absolute best part of the entire film, dies while narrating his death in a Three Stooges Skit.  Good job, Disney.  You killed an amazing villain too early just like Lucas did with Darth Maul. Every single animal in the movie is designed to be as cute and marketable as possible.  PETA helped craft the Rose character and even got to write a line.  Horrible acting by several of the cast:  Daisy Ridley is just bad.  She again has a hard time keeping a straight face in many scenes and appears to be just still giddy to be in a Star Wars movie.  That shouldn't show, Daisy.  Rose was a pointless character with an awful actress.  They wasted the talents of Benicio del Toro on the most cringeworthy Deus ex Machina moment in movie history.  Laura Dern is junk.  She's never been good, but with a bad character with only 1 motivation (I'm pretty sure Rian Johnson told her "Ok, here is how deep your character is:  You're a smug b**** the entire film.  GO!") she's even worse.  I didn't think that was possible.<br/><br/>The movie was just bad, folks.  The reviewers were paid off, plain and simple.  The user score is much more accurate, and that 5.3 is going to drop a LOT more as people spend more time away from the film thinking about it.  Attack of the Clones was much better, and that's an absolutely awful film that I have a hard time rewatching.  Rian Johnson showed so much talent in films like Looper, but he has no spine to stand up to the executives at Disney and that comes through every second of this 2 hour and 30 minute commercial for toys.  There is a reason directors keep getting fired from Star Wars productions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I don't see how anyone watched The Force Awakens, which introduced loads of unanswered questions about the backstory of Snoke, Rey, etc, and came out of this film satisfied with the total lack of explanation and writer's cop-out. You can tell JJ Abrams was somehow involved in this trilogy, since the proverbial checks they wrote ultimately couldn't be cashed, ala "LOST." I am left wondering what "character development" most of these professional and user critics are talking about. Another 2 hours and 30 minutes of film and we don't know anything more about Rey and her impractically good lightsaber skills than we did after 2 hours and 15 minutes of Episode 7. Furthermore, we don't know anything more about Snoke, his motivations, backstory, etc. He's obviously been around for a while and faced some challenges....just look at that face. But we are left completely empty-handed. At least after Episode 7, we had the promise of learning more about these mysterious new characters. And don't act like we were just a bunch of rabid fans crafting crazy theories out of nothing. What was up with all of the Josh Gad/Daisy Ridley "who are Rey's parents" teaser videos last year? After Episode 8, I feel tremendously let down at the way all of that innuendo was pissed away over 2.5 hours. Aside from that missed potential, there are at least 3 showdowns in this film that could have been the most bad ass in Star Wars history, but were overwhelmingly short, poorly edited, and/or a bait & switch. The final showdown had me thinking "okay, this one sequence could definitely make the whole film worthwhile for me." And then they pulled the rug out from under it. I think that moment really sealed the deal. I won't even get started on the totally pointless "side quest" to the Casino planet which could have been edited out in its entirety and would have made 0 difference to any of the story. And a closing thought, what happened to awesome John Williams compositions for every Star Wars film? Even the prequel trilogies had Duel of the Fates, Across the Stars, Battle of the Heroes. The music is far from bad, but c'mon....I think this is a sign you aren't giving him much to work with, Kathleen Kennedy...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If we all recall, the first words spoken in The Force Awakens were "This will begin to make things right." by Lor San Tekka.  After seeing The Last Jedi, things are certainly not right.  It seems that Disney has opted to not go the route of the traditional Star Wars lore that we all grew up loving and what made Star Wars so damn popular in the first place but has instead gone with action sequences that would make Michael Bay proud and corny humor that often falls short of the intended target.  THE FOLLOWING SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS:<br/>The way some of the story elements were handled often disregarded the importance of a particular character or item to the overall arc of the saga.  The way Luke was handled almost seems as if his backstory or the importance of the character is to the fans was nothing more than an afterthought in order to create more room for Disney's vision of Star Wars.  Some of the actions that Luke takes in this new entry is so far from what the character from Return of the Jedi would have done that is teeters a bit on the absurd.  The Skywalker family lightsaber has been in the saga since the beginning and some could even call it the "Excalibur" of the film yet it was needlessly destroyed in a sequence with Rey and Kylo.  I believe that portion alone shows Disney's disregard for the past.  It almost felt as if Disney was conveying "screw the past and the stories George Lucas created, this ship is ours now and we don't care what the fans or anyone else believes so we will do with it as we please".<br/><br/>For now it is believed that Rey's parents were "nobodies" which is completely upsetting.  I'm holding out hope that they are pulling the ole "New Hope" trick where Obi Wan tells Luke that Vader betrayed and murdered his father and that in Episode 9 they will have a "shock", gotcha moment where we find out her true parentage.  I can keep going on about things I did not like with this film but I will spare you the drama and let you draw your own opinion.  I will leave it with this:  The Last Jedi fails on so many level.  It completely ignores what was set up by Abrams in The Force Awakens and does its own thing.  I don't even feel like this deserves to be apart of the Saga films.  Matter of fact in my eyes it isn't.  The action sequences were great which is the only reason I gave this a 4 out of 10 but when reflecting on this new film and Episode 7 before it, it all just feels so much like high budget fanfiction.  I have a bad feeling about this...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Too many characters. No clear protagonist. A real lack of narrative drive. Still zero explanation as to how this whole world became what it is.<br/><br/>My biggest revelation walking out of the theater was: "Wow. They don't actually have a story to tell." There are some great MOMENTS sprinkled throughout but there's an entire subplot that nearly sinks the film and the story just doesn't work as a cohesive whole. Way too many recycled ideas from the original trilogy and not enough understanding of the characters from those films.<br/><br/>What they've done to the original Heroes of the Rebellion is just plain sad and, frankly, unbelievable to anyone intimate with the characters and story arcs from the original trilogy.<br/><br/>The Empire Strikes Back is defined by Luke's refusal to give up on or abandon his friends. Return of the Jedi is defined by Luke's refusal to give up on his father. Put simply, the Luke in the Last Jedi is not the same character. And I don't mean a changed Luke. He's a different person.<br/><br/>Put simply, I fundamentally disagree with the interpretation of these characters and the story course these new movies have set. How I miss the days when most Star Wars movies ended with a flourish triumphant and a definitive victory for the forces of light.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I had a lot of fun watching it but I cant help but feel it was a misfire on the whole. The Force Awakens was a complete remake of Ep. 4 but i am gonna be totally honest. I like FA better then this film. I definitely was more excited when i left the theater 2 years ago that's for sure. This movie felt like it should be ep.9, there really seems like there is nothing to look forward too in the final film of this trilogy. Too much humor in the wrong places, Finn and Rose's adventure was totally pointless, Phasma, Again was wasted in this film!! I really liked Mark Hamill's performance and Carrie Fisher was good too. Just too many plot holes, too many unanswered questions from FA and some totally unexpected things that happen and close the book on characters and story that leave you hanging or feeling underwhelmed. Special Effects were incredible, Space battles were great and there is one cool light-saber battle but (minor spoiler here), you will be very disappointed at the number of times 2 light-sabers actually touch. This isn't a terrible film at all but its just not a really great Star Wars movie :-( I am really looking forward to JJ Abrams doing ep 9 and i never thought id say that lol</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Now Ren is in a leader role and it will be interesting to watch. Also I do not think that Rey need's a big backstory. Mace Windu has no backstory, Yoda hast no backstory and Obi-Wan has no backstory. Why should they be all related to eachother? Good action, music and amazing effects like always.<br/>I do not think that they should have killed Luke in this movie becouse now there is no posebility Rey is not turning to the dark side and she needs more training. And there were a few jokes that did not work for me or were on the wrong place. Also the Leia space scene looked awkward but was still a nice idea. The actors made a very good job. Adam Driver, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher were just amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Mit csináltatok a kedvenc univerzumommal ? Nem értem. Annyira látszik a Disney jelenléte.SPOILER. NA én is egy hatalmas fanboy vagyok/voltam, szinte az összes játékot kitoltam, könyveket is olvastam stb.Az első és legnagyobb bajom az hogy abszolúte nem mertek kockáztatni, itt van egy hatalmas univerzum tele érdekesebbnél érdekesebb történetekkel és helyszínekkel amiket bele lehetett volna építeni a filmbe, ehelyett ebben a részben is konkrét jeleneteket megint lemásoltak amik ráadásul fele annyira se működtek. Most nemmegyek bele az űrbéli bombázásba meg egyszer van vákum egyszer nincs mert SW de legalább akkor csinálták volna egységesre meg az indokok hogy a lézer már nemsebez annyit 50 méterrel hátrébról stb. Az az üldözéses rész az komédia volt. Továbbá a karakterek megint 0-ák. Nem volt egy normálisan megírt karakter talán még Kyloval próbálkoztak és reméltem behozzák a szürkejediket de az se volt. Finn az vicc volt amit művelt ebben a részben, az ázsiai csaj csak a kínai piacnak volt beletéve.Leiarol nem is akarok beszélni. Joda volt még talán a legértékelhetőbb meg azok a cselédek Lukenál XD. A casinos jelenet megint tök fölösleges volt. Disneynek megint bele kellett rakni valami cuki állatot amivel plüssfigurákat eltudnak adni. Jöttek is  repülőmedverozmárpingvinek... Meg ez az ősi Jedi könyves hülyeség hogy ezek milyen szentírások azt kb meditált a rey egyet és akkor má nem is értek semmit... Ja és kifelejtettem a kedvencem... A sith nagyurat... SEMMI ÉRTELME NEM VOLT EGY NAGY **** volt az egész, utána azon röhögtem akik már 2 éve gyartották a teóriákat hogy húú ki is ez a nagyúr  és hogy milyen badass lesz meg stb... hát semmit nem tudtunk meg róla. Épkézláb harc megint nem volt, felrobbant 2 hajó azt csá. Fénykard párbaj volt az a 2 perc azokkal a samurajokkal vagy mikkel... Szürke rohamosztagos megint kb minden plakáton ott volt ésa változatosság kedvéért megint volt 2 mondata és megint valami mélybe belezuhant mert mashogy nem tudnak itt meghalni az emberek. Aztán megint jött egy Hoth 2.0 csak mégkevesebb akcióval ahol megint semmit nem értek a lépegetők és megint elmenekülnek. Ott azt hittem lesz egy jó harc Luke és Ren között de csak egy DW Obi 2.-át láthattunk. Beleerőltettek a marveles hülyeséget hogy az milyen poén ha visszaemlékszünk előző részekre meg minden jelenetet amiben volt egy kis feszültség valami huszadrangú poénnal próbálták lezárni. Engem már rohadtul zavar, hogy lenyomja a torkunkon a Disney ezeket az ötlettelen SW filmeket mondván , hogy majd a név úgy is eladja magát...Nekem kicsi ez az univerzum. Olyan mintha csak egy naprendszerbe játszódna és nem egy egész Galaxysba. Nem gondoltam volna soha de visszasírom az előzménytrilógiát, mert minden hibája ellenére egy ízig vérig látványos sw filmek voltak aminél a sok ****et megfelelően kompenzálták a látványos csatajelenetekkel és a változatos bolygókkal stb. Megértem hogy valakiknek tetszett de azoknak nem tudok megbocsátani akik így legyintenek rá és nem foglalkoznak vele mert amíg profit jön addig nem fogunk jó SW-t látni mert nem fognak fölös energiát belefeccölni. Itt is ideje egy olyan összefogásnak mint amit a gamer közösség csinált az EA ellen mert ezek a gigacégek csak abból értenek ha pénzt veszítenek. Még jobban kielemezhetném a filmet de már látom hogy így is elég sokat írtam.  Nekem ez a véleményem erről de szívesen fogadoma válaszokat amikkel esetleg nem értetek egyet . Végszóra az Erő és egy jobb SW film legyen veletek :)﻿</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Yes,it`s entertaining and can be watchable regardless your age (which i think the main focus of the movie was), Disney tried to sell the movie as a "darker star wars flick" but it wasn`t, not even close. It has tons of plot holes, almost all characters evolution from episode 7 was non existent (except a little of Rey). All the important or misterious aspects of the previous movies are literally thrown to the garbage in this one. All important characters felt flat and some of them i even knew were there, like Chewie, why !? lol. Well is good, but nohing more, for me is a 6 out of 10 , i still think Rouge One, Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi are better Star Wars movies by far !!! Even some Episode 7 moments are better than this one. Also.....Leia in space.....dead.......in -245 Cº coming back to the ship and then be well in 2 hours !?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke only needed to yell "Get off my Lawn" to fulfill the grumpy old man trope.  Leia, aka Mary Poppins in space was ridiculous on so many levels.  Worse of all, this movie just wasn't entertaining.  Rian Johnson gets a new trilogy out of this?  I hope Disney reconsiders that decision.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie feels like a cheap imitation of "Empire Strikes Back" the similarities between the two are so blatantly apparent:<br/><br/>* An opening battle at the beginning that involves the resistance on the run from the First Order<br/>* The force-sensitive character spending the majority of the plot away from the rest of the characters, "learning" (I use that term very loosely) from the old master on a secluded planet. * The old master being reluctant to train the student due to past mistakes * The rest of the characters being pursued by the bad guys for much of the film yet unable to get away<br/>* Said characters taking a risk by recruiting a new hacker character from a flashy location, who's motives are unclear.<br/>* The Jedi-apprentice character going into a dark side cave, being made to face herself then leaving her "training" too early to rescue her friends<br/>* The hacker betraying the people who were counting on him<br/>* A "revelation" (if you can call it that) about the force-sensitive character's parents<br/>* A major confrontation between The Jedi Apprentice and the big-bad-emperor-archetype * Kylo Ren turning on Snoke and killing him due to Rey's influence<br/>* Land speeders facing off against AT-ATs on a planet covered in white powder (might as well be snow)<br/>* The rebels being scattered and broken at the end, but with a sense of hope and a mission<br/><br/>Stop me if ANY of this sounds familiar. This movie basically took the entire plot of Empire Strikes Back and threw in some new visuals. There are many bad decisions throughout this movie that hurt it:<br/><br/>- The "Revelation" of Rey's parents being nobodies pretty much wastes all the hype built up from the last movie<br/>- Snoke being killed by Kylo Ren almost effortlessly (Why didn't he just do this earlier?)with no backstory being give. This makes Snoke seem like a typical stock character meant to move the story forward<br/>- Leia's sudden use of the force with no training (that we know of)<br/>- Captain Phasma being dispatched with literally no character development whatsoever<br/>- No Jedi Training<br/>- Forced humor<br/>- No Lightsaber duels<br/>- Yoda (his appearance was pure fan service. Totally unnecessary)<br/>- Luke's demise, such a massive waste of Mark Hamill's talents.<br/><br/>There are only a few bright spots in this movie:<br/><br/>- The force connection between Rey and Ren<br/>- Snoke's force powers<br/>- Rey and Ren fighting together<br/>- Luke's Force Illusion</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Turns out he's basically nobody and we'll never know. His only purpose was to be a Palpatine stand-in so Kylo could kill him in a redux of the RotJ throne room scene<br/>- Another question was "Who is Rey and why does she have Jedi powers despite no training?" Turns out she is no one special at all, and she received instantaneous superpowers because she's just a huge Mary Sue after all.<br/>- Another question is "why did Luke go hide?" Turns out he hid because he made a complete mess of trying to train new Jedi (in a way that totally wrecks his character) and went to go sulk by himself even though his friends needed him.<br/>- Another question was "why is the New Republic's army called The Resistance, and how did the scraps of the Empire build a massive super-weapon?" Well that's not really answered, but now by the end of this movie the Resistance has been whittled down to a handful of people and the FO is ascendant, so Disney has finally finished wrecking the end of RotJ and reset things to the start of ANH.<br/><br/>I am utterly shocked with how cynical and hateful Disney's treatment of this franchise has been. They could have just made a new story with a new conflict and a few references to the old stuff, but instead they're doing everything possible to ruin the plot and characters of the original trilogy. I will never forgive them for this. As far as I'm concerned the Thrawn books are the true canon, not this pandering, cynical junk.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke returns so euh that's good. And euh oh there is one amazing scene from a visual standpoint. My mouth fell open with how amazing it looked. The space battles are fine. Kylo Ren is cool euh kinda. Carrie Fisher is really good in this movie from an acting standpoint.<br/><br/>Now the negatives. This movie is so long and so boring in parts. I can forgive boring parts in a movie but when i want to cut more than an hour of scenes out of a Star Wars movie then you didn't do it right. It's like the first half of Rogue one but just longer. The story isn't good. Like really jeezes. I had so much moments where I was thinking wait that's not how the force works. They moved it in these weird ways that don't really make any sense in my mind. The new characters aren't that interesting. Laura Dern her character is fine but that's about it. The whole Finn storyline should have been cut out of the movie. It's funny but when you cut it out the movie doesn't change. Thats how useless it was. Captain Phasma is again not used. The whole training Rey with Luke thing takes so long to get going. I now he's had it rough but come on. Luke really doesn't do anything in this movie besides whining. He does one thing at the end. Yippie? There is to much humor in this movie. They try to do these dark themes but then ruin it with humor that doesn't really work most of the time. Snoke is useless. If you wanted to learn something about Snoke don't bother. The reveal of Rey's parent's is really weird and stupid. Don't bother just look it up. The movie itself is fine but i'll probably never watch it again for years. It's cool to see on the big screen but i kinda felt that i wasted my money.

The Last Jedi contains zero character development, zero story, and is by far the worst Star Wars movie of all the Star Wars movies so far - except of course for the diabolical Star Wars Holiday Special! It is truly sad to see Disney turn a film for the family into a children's movie and to render the movie history of the Star Wars Universe effectively meaningless! In essence, with every step of this movie Disney seems to be telling fans, "this is NOT for the fans," while its previous installment was clearly an ode to the fans! Perhaps every member of every audience that will watch “The Last Jedi” will hope for, or be able to envision better plot routes than any of those taken by director Rian Johnson - the youngest of the children in the audience included!  The one silver lining in “The Last Jedi” is that perhaps finally George Lucas' second Trilogy, might now be seen in a far brighter light than ever before! For characters such as Mace Windu, Obi Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn and the ever popular Darth Maul and of course its amazing lightsaber duels, Star Wars Episodes 1-3 are increasingly looking to be a far superior body of work to Disneys simple kiddy flicks! Replace Jar-Jar Binks and its terrible CGI - which are gladly missing form Last Jedi - and Episodes 1-3 would have been a success! For Episode 8 there is no such simple saving solution!<br/><br/>Star Wars has now undoubtedly lost its core fans and it awaits to see if the box office receipts follow! Surely China will have little more interest in this movie than the last one! And without the return receipts of Star Wars fans the children’s market may not be enough to save Episode 8 from a shocking underperformance!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Were they bribed by Disney? Did they watch Empire Strikes Back on a 4K TV and thought this was The Last Jedi they were watching? Unbelievable. They make reviewing a joke, not to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>I am very disappointed in how Disney is treating the potentially greatest franchise there is. I admit there were a few good things in this movie, like the Visuals and special effects but Disney seems to forget the audience is going to the cinema for a good story, first of all. That is what this movie lacked. I like humor but this was so poorly done in this movie. Do you know a movie where the villains made a laughing stock of themselves like General Hugs (Hux) and Kylo Ren? The villains in this movie do not instill fear like Vader and Palpetine. God, I miss them and I hope they rise from their graves to rescue episode 9. And then Snoke, a Sith Lord! Palpetine would have felt what Kylo Ren was doing and wouldn't have been killed so easily. Who was Snoke? We will never know and please don't bother bringing him back, Disney. He never did make an impression.<br/><br/>Then the space battles. Didn't have the Dreadnaught have shields? Such a massive ship destroyed by a tiny bomber. I don't believe it. The chase of the Rebel fleet. For Vader this would have been easy pickings, but not for Hux and Ren. I know they can't fill the shoes of Vader, but these guys are just pathetic. Then Luke. I have read all the books from the Expanded Universe (pre Disney era) where he became an interesting character and Jedi Master. What a great read that was. The Luke in this film, utterly boring, a disappointment, a lame excuse of a Jedi with lots of selfdoubt. Glad he is out of the picture.<br/><br/>I could go on and on raving and ranting about this movie. I hope my message is clear. Disney, please sell the franchise back to uncle George. Only he can save Star Wars. Through this movie I even appreciate the second trilogy more and more. I even miss Jarr Jarr Binks.<br/><br/>I won't be looking forward to Episode IX. I don't bother anymore to watch that movie in the Cinema unless it gets a User Score on average of 8.0.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Instead he acts like a grumpy old hobo for almost the whole runtime. We learn that the Jedi Academy failed for unbelievably stupid and non-character-appropriate reasons.

For my opinion if we divide Episode VII and VIII we can totally find differences in all aspects. I think it based on work of director(J. J. Abrams was changed by Rian Johnson). And for me this change gives great result in common. And now step by step:<br/>1. I'll recommend you watch Star Wars: Episode VIII in IMAX cinemas because for my opinion it's the best way how feel and be imbued with this film. Audio and picture are in directly high level. IMAX will help you find it.<br/>2. When I had watched previous episode I definitely understood that this film will be some kind introduction to the new trilogy and in the next one we'll see something great. And it was right think. The plot is testing your nerves throughout the film and you never know what will be next, maybe In this aspect I thought about II and III episodes because plots of them were absolutely amazing. In my childhood, when I watched them, I was very worried about what would happen next. My body was shaking but my mind wanted more. Yesterday I felt same feeling so for me it's great success.<br/>3. Cast. The new picture will continue to introduce new characters like Finn, Rey, Po, etc.(And actors coped with this task) But like a previous part of the saga it will also satisfy the appetite of old-school Star Wars fans and me actually too ( =)  )<br/><br/>For conclusion I want add that we don't know about next part but I feel if they continue working in this direction(RIGHT DIRECTION) we will see absolutely amazing IX part of Star Wars saga.<br/>My score - 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson gave me hope after hearing said critic's remarks, but wow was this a mess.  This movie jumped all over the place, had no real plot, many of the random tasks of the movie were dumb and made no sense, unemotional, it was all just incredibly disappointing.  I put this down with Clones as the bottom two movies.  This movie also hurts "The Force Awakens" for me as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Once you accept this and view the movie as a part of this trilogy and centering around our new characters, a greater appreciation for this film is found. I found a few moments of the film to be strange and perhaps unwarranted but overall it played to the whole theme. The Last Jedi turns our attention away from theory and speculation about connections to the past, like Rey's parents or Snoke's history and forces us to place all our attention on Kylo Ren and Rey and their present. This is the dynamic we should be focusing on and it was executed wonderfully. I was thrilled and overjoyed with the writing and execution of every scene involving Rey or Kylo Ren. As for the other subplots of the movie, i.e. Finn, Poe, and the Resistance, they had their moments of beauty and Star Wars level of awesome, but also had their moments of confusion and uselessness. However, these all lead us to the same major theme of letting the past die. Finn and Poe at the beginning of this film were thinking to heavily about opportunities arising from previous moments and not thinking about the future. Poe was resting on his laurels of brilliance from previous victories to show failure after failure in this movie, and Finn focusing on his relationship with Rey and not realizing his opportunity in the present to do what is right. Going into this movie I thought how difficult it was to transition from thinking that this trilogy is about Rey and Kylo and how my Star Wars brain will always attempt to tie things back to Luke, Leia, and Han. I left the theater fully focused on Rey and Kylo and the future of the Resistance. Their connections to the past no longer matter. For Rian Johnson to force me to focus on the future and truly 'let the past die' is an accomplishment that cannot be overstated. My questions entering The Last Jedi were focused on how our new characters connect to the past and where they fit into the Skywalker story, but my questions leading to episode 9 have nothing to do with that. I am more plot and new character-focused than I have ever been. Overall it was a great movie that was unafraid of the potential backlash from the fans that are unwilling to break ties with the original 6 films. I fear that a completely separate trilogy that Rian Johnson is currently developing will be poorly received because of this same realization.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But I think a lot of these people upvoting it are just escapism addicts looking for a fresh hit, they don't care if it's Star Wars or Marvel or what have you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I was truly trying to love the movie as I was watching it, I wanted to like it, I really did. But Its not a traditional Star Wars film and it was honestly the strangest Star Wars movie I've ever seen in terms of pace, story telling and overall feel. It seemed like too many stories were trying to be told at once, and left a hot mess of a movie. Some of the best parts and reveals of the movie were snuffed out by over saturation of a side story with minor characters, or unnecessary plot twists that lead to more unnecessary plot twists. They really let us down on some of the reveals and some characters were gravely disrespected. Among it all there's a visible effort to tell a great story, with terrible, awful, over saturated execution. It really feels like additional setup for the last movie, Episode IX, instead of a standalone triumph like every other Star Wars film. The Force Awakens was a much better film, and that breaks my heart the most. I thinks we all wanted this movie to delve deep into these new characters, and all we got were more questions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

All the main characters are doing stupid things one after another. There is no tension and adversity, since most of the problems the characters face is because they were too stupid to think 5minutes before acting. Like Finn and Rey parking their ship right in front of the big casino. What were they expecting, that no one would see it ? Rey going inside a dark side nexus to ask it who were her parents ? What kind of moron would ask that kind of question in that place ???<br/><br/>As for the plotholes, what about the Maz communication ? If they can send a long-range communication to Maz, why can't they send one to ask for reinforcements ? Why do they have to wait until they're on the rebel base ? How can Maz know what the cracker will wear that day ? No answers, those plots are just a**pulls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

So the Rebellion is fleeing the Empire after a devastating attack, while their one Jedi trainee has flown off to train with a wise old master. Where have I seen that before? Meanwhile some of the heroes go to a fancy installation to find someone to help them, who winds up betraying them? Then there's a throne room confrontation almost just like the one from RotJ except it's got some stiff and awkward lightsaber chop socky (trust me, I watch a ton of action movies, this scene will not hold up to repeat viewing, there are fan-made lightsaber fights that are way more intense and dramatic)?<br/><br/>Disney clearly has ZERO ideas of what to do here except completely rehash the original movies while stuffing affirmative action roles down everyone's throats. They have officially made a trilogy EVEN WORSE than the prequels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A main character is literally missing for 45 minutes. There are literally only three characters to care anything about. Villains who do die go out in the worst possible ways. The tone is uneven and it is not only a bad film, it is a horrible Star Wars film. It's actually the worst. The only bright spots are Luke, Rey, and Ben. Half the film is filler. I wanted to like it but it's atrocious. Rian Johnson doesn't understand what Star Wars is and tried to make a Rian Johnson film, not a Star Wars film. And it's even worse than his previous films. The forced humor and gags ruin emotional moments. Star Wars is visual storytelling with music and as little dialogue as possible. Johnson doesn't understand this. No silent montage with music at the end. Ending shot was the worst way possible to end the film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's mildly amusing in the moment, but these movies are going to be dated as heck and totally unwatchable within a couple years (unlike the originals, which are timeless). Basically Disney has turned Star Wars into Marvel, where the real point is watching the characters banter with each other and tease us with will-he/won't-he soap opera shenanigans. If this had been a new series I'd be more forgiving, but since they are trying to pass this tripe off as STAR WARS I have no choice but to call it out for being the cheap, phony, cynical cash-in it clearly is.<br/><br/>Also: people were laughing their butts off when Carrie Poppins when zooming through space without a space suit!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Anyone want to know how Snoke got to Kylo? online jedi chat forum under the guise of 18 year old blonde female Jedi wannabe or something..  Luke should have been monitoring Kylos online history perhaps and lets face it Snoke looked rather 'peado' in that robe.  But we'll never know because 'Mr P' got chopped. Just one of many questionable bits in a film I so wanted to love. It did have some great scenes but not enough. And why so comical? Disappointing.  Also I may add that Disney sacked the Han Solo director as they weren't happy, maybe they should sack the guy who sacks guys now for letting this happen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Some nice nods to the original and prequel classics but still very little done with the introduced sequel characters and overall plot to move it forward, past the history of the originals and the recycled elements (e.g recycled designs, scenes, visuals, narratives). Very vanilla, including the disappointing villain Kylo Ren, a watered down Anakin/Darth Vader with little emotion and energy. Daisy Ridley does give it her all though, so props to an extent. Film feels like an Empire Strikes Back with touches of ROTJ but with less momentum. Ironic given Empire Strikes Back already was quite overrpraised movie in itself as a setup for Return of the Jedi. A lack of acknowledging the end of Returns seems to have tarred some plot points that would have been entertaining had they been explored. Similarly, The return of Yoda as a Force Ghost was expected, a speaking appearance by Hayden Christensen would have tied together past events nicely, while pushing some ideas forward. Especially given the importance of the resolved Father/Son relationship which was where Hamill's character and Christensen both left off after the previous 2 trilogies. However some of the small changes are still welcome and less shying away from the force tricks and cute wonderous creatures is welcome, the kids and adults loved the reintroduction of such goofy features sorely missing in Awakens. Nods to the paranoia of previous heroes and self sabotage were somewhat interesting. Overall quality of battles is still a letdown and at times, still plays the nostalgia card a little to heavily towards battles in episodes 4-6. Film still could have done a better job tying the prequel ideas and originals and then one upping them in some way, which the prequels did through variations to the formula while still including nods to the original.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Too much recycling of the original trilogy (4-5-6) will appease the small group of aging internet middle aged fan subgroup and the small but vocal nerd bandwagon online, but Disney will need to do more to keep the interest of kids, latter gen x, millienials and post-millienials who also appreciated the prequels and their expansion of Star Wars characters, story, humor, lore, scale, visuals and the overall universe, from a writing and production point of view. Drastic changes will be needed to continue the series outside of appeasing 40 year olds and the Hollywood elite that want a token cameo for nerd cred to relive their childhood. Critic influencers and clickbait blogs may push the film, but know it benefits them to do so. Perhaps the final (9th film) can build off the series the way the prequels (Volume 1 to 3) did wonderfully.   5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

First of all I never write a review here before, but this nostalgia about the 4, 5 and 6 need to stop. The first trilogy wasn't perfect, ok? There's flaws on every Star Wars movie. First of all like Snoke, we didn't know who are the Emperor or his background history before the Prequels, and for almost 20 years they didn't answer that on the movies. And like Snoke he died in a stupied way, he didn't even fight, he just used the force on Vader and Luke, and that's it exactly like SNOKE did. The best Palpatine fight isn't on Movie Screen but in the Clone Wars 3D Cartoon.<br/><br/>Phasma didn't had much attention? Ok she has her own Comic Book, and if you are a real Star Wars fan and not this Fake Nostalgia Fanboy, you should know that. She is like Boba Fett in the Episodes 5 and 6. Everybody loves Boba Fett, but before the comics he is just a Guy in a cool Suit, he didn't add anything to the movies, actually the whole Crew of Mercenaries that Vader hires to pursuit Han, Luke and Leia was useful or even relevant to the movies.<br/><br/>Another thing, Luke died in a better way that Obi-wan or Qui-Gon Jinn. He won a fight without fighting, that's the most Jedi thing ever done. And to the people complaining about his death, if you are a fan of Star Wars you should know that the master always dies in the movies, always. That's how Star Wars always worked, there shouldn't be any surprise about that, we could know that since TFA. This movie is about bring back Luke to give some Hope to people around the Galaxy, and not about winning the war they are losing. Because this Luke isn't the Luke from Expended Universe (LEGENDS).<br/><br/>I love to see people complaining about how stupid the comedy is on the New Star Wars era, but C'mon C3-PO is just a comic relief, since day one. You hated the Porgs? The Ewooks looked awful on Return of the Jedi. Star Wars always had jokes and some silly moments.<br/>Some people are complaining about how The Last Jedi ruined his childhood memories, but they cannot accept that a movie can have some jokes for Kids? Really?<br/><br/>Another thing, stop trying to fight the CGI, we live in 2017, almost 2018, all the Hollywood studios use CGI effects for a lot of reasons, and they will not stop using such a good tool because you want to live in the 80's. Finally this new movies isn't about Luke, Leia or Han, we all need to accept that, they are just giving the torch to a role new generation. That's why Disney dumped the Extended Universe (because there, Luke is so overpower, and do things beyond the Last Jedi stuff that people are complaining, and makes the force on the movies look boring, and again if you are a real Star Wars fan you should know that). Extended was heavily based on Skywalker family, and the new trilogy isn't. I liked the movie, has flaws? Yes, like every other Star Wars Movie. Personally I think people need to see this movie as something new, and different, and not waiting some nostalgia, because this movie is about the new generation of heroes in the galaxy, and not the old one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I will NEVER forgive Disney for what they've done to this series. Even the prequels didn't wreck the Star Wars universe as much as this did, and at least they weren't just a totally cynical excuse to stuff money down Mickey Mouse's pants. Crabby old hobo Luke throwing his beloved father's lightsaber away like a piece of trash? Superman Leia flying through the vacuum of space? It was cringey and totally disrespectful of the original trilogy.

I really don't want to, but I can't really understand where all the great critics from the press and some of my friends come from. Episode 7 was great in my opinion.<br/>Of course, it copied episode 4  in many moments and some scenes didn't really make sense, but that was ok for me, because it made you feel nostalgic.<br/>I just had a good feeling when I came out of the theatre.<br/><br/>But now to Episode 8:<br/><br/>Leia's "coming back from death" scene was actually the **** moment in any movie I've seen. It would have been ok to me, if she just died (RIP Carry Fisher). I mean you could not know before, that the actor will die, but the role itself didn't have any relevance in the story anymore. The movie was always about "let the past die", so why Leia cannot?<br/><br/>The movie was too long. The whole story around Kantobyte was just irrelevant for the plot and also quite ****. I mean they got arrested for wrong parking... WRONG PARKING!?!?!?! Really Disney??? WTF is wrong with you?!? Some criticism on society isn't bad... ok... but I felt pretty bored about this action strand.<br/>Furthermore, I couldn't have felt more indifferently about Rose. Everything episode 7 just built up, is now **** up!<br/>Snoke, who came out of nowhere, able to teach the "mighty" Kylo Ren and strong enough to built up the first order...dead now.<br/>Nobody knows who he is and where he's coming from. Palpatin must have heard of him... he just had to. You could have write a awesome background story of his character, but Disney seemed  to have no ideas, so they just said:" ok, let him die,cause we aren't creative today!"<br/>And for everyone who's saying:"They will make a movie just about snoke maybe!" It won't change anything! An interesting and mysterious character died in a ridiculous way.<br/><br/>The whole scene about Rey trying to convert Kylo... I felt like I sat in Episode 6. Just the same old thing. What really worked in episode 7 in my opinion, just feels uninspired now.<br/><br/>Luke Skywalker, most unsympathetic character of the year!<br/>Ok, we understand, you hate yourself, but why you have to pity yourself for 2 f*cking hours???<br/>Everyone just wanted to watch epic practicing scenes. I saw actually one wich made me feel disappointed.<br/>But I have to say: The last fight against Kylo was damn awesome and for everybody who's crying that he died... The movie is called:"The Last Jedi!"<br/><br/>The Humor just killed it all!<br/>I liked it in episode 7, but those cute BB8 moments in episode 7, just came all 3 minutes.<br/>F*CK PORGS! Nobody liked Jar Jar, so why are you doing something even 1000 times more stupidly???<br/>Just for making merch? Shame on you!<br/><br/><br/>I mean, of course there have been scenes I even liked, but the decisions about the story, how they threw away interesting characters like Phasma and Snoke and the humor just disappointed me. All in all, Im not a big fan of the movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

BAD:<br/><br/>The writers gave no respect to any of the iconic or new secondary characters, except for Rosa, and the reason for that is painfully obvious. It feels someone at Disney has put out a death warrant on all original characters (out with the old, in with the lame?). Truth be told, I never liked Rey so much, I just can't reconcile her being so amazing with STILL NO TRAINNING NOR NOTIONS ABOUT THE FORCE. Yeah Anakin killed a super destroyer when he was a kid, but that was the pre-craps.  First order has way better equipment, which is so much bigger and better than the empire in its apex, to the point of being dysphoric (why do you really need super giant AT-AT's? No really, why? The original ones weren't killing people fast enough? The notion of resistance/rebellion is all over the place, its as if they really just gave up mid-screenplay and just started using them interchangeably. It really doesn't matter though, there's like 6 or 7 left of them anyway (what a massacre)<br/><br/>The movie goes from full on massacre/pseudo guerrilla weird to full on philosophical treatise, at 2.5 hours, can't think of how they can market it for kids   Good but Meh<br/><br/>Finn, finally getting some love on the writing side, great chemistry with everyone, especially between Rosa and him. I put him here because his quest is worse than pointless, actually DETRIMENTAL to the Resistance/Rebellion.<br/><br/>Leia and Luke, love them, just the best. Its unforgivable just how little time they spend together. Regardless, they both shine in every way (though the script doesn't do them justice)<br/><br/>Good<br/><br/>Kylo Ren is less emo, more Sith on this one, pretty good development for the character. Daisy Ridley/Rey shine when interacting with him. Worthy bad guy now<br/><br/>Awesome visuals, great music Porgs are not given so much screen time</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson showed us what he imagined of the Star Wars universe and it was the best usage of its different creatures, society and the Force, opening a vast range of new posibilities and stories.<br/>Keep in mind that this is a movie, not a book. Its focus is on what is most important, so it won't answer all the questions, naturally. The movie give us everything we could ask for: amazing batles and fights (physical and emotional), interesting characters, great villian, mounting tension and unexpected plot events. Plus it is a lot of fun to watch as well, but not trying hard to be funny.<br/>Well done!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not in a "this movie was over-hyped way", but more of a "they finally figured it out" way. I was definitely disappointed. The Last Jedi was still a fine movie. Acting, visual, musical score, character chemistry, and more comedy than usual that actually fit in fine with the film. My disappointment comes with the plot. There were quite a few plot holes and questionable writing decisions that just made no sense to me. Why keep Poe in the dark about the master escape plan? Then maybe he never sends Finn and Rose off the ship where they get double crossed anyway. The whole Casino part of the movie felt very out of place in the Star Wars universe. I understand the point they were trying to make with it. Those who profit from war have no side, it's about the money that fueling the destruction brings in. But it still just felt very forced and out of place.<br/><br/>The relationship between Luke and Rey was very reminiscent of Empires Strikes Back in my opinion. A lot of the reviews I read made it seem like this was all original stuff that didn't hearken back to its predecessors. I, now, feel like that was a false statement. Kylo's growth and development was great. It was a shame they built up Snoke so much only to see him cut down and we'll have to wait for expanded universe content to really know about the character. I get that it was probably about not wanting to create another "emperor" show down in the final movie, but it still felt lacking. I felt that the ending plot device was fantastic. Crait really showed the desperation that the Resistance is facing. I mean, the entire Resistance is now aboard the Millennium Falcon. There's no easy way for the Resistance to come back from what is surely a horrible defeat.  And they basically have to build back from nothing a la Star Wars: Rebels. But all the ways we got to that final plot device was just disappointing. I definitely plan on seeing it again and trying to look at it from a different angle.<br/><br/>Still a good movie. But not great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Those who are dissapointed should rethink this again since this reveal has a great meaning for the kids that will see this movie.<br/><br/>Now I can safely say that this movie is far better than Episode VII. Rian provided answers to most of what I wanted and some great twists to keep me engaged. I love Star Wars, but I only care about the episodes (the spin-offs just don't make the cut for me) so after waiting for two years for this movie I am happy to say it was worth the wait.<br/><br/>DON'T LET THE HATERS OR ANGRY FANS GET INTO YOUR HEAD, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE, GO.

That or they went into the movie thinking "I like when things go boom, it would be cool if they made Star Wars like Transformers and had big explosions and pretty lights" the plot was horrible. No questions were answered from the last movie. So many new questions came to mind. Complete waste of Mark Hamill. To be honest I enjoyed The Phantom Menace more than this movie.

As a Star Wars fan of over 25 years, this was a really refreshing change. The movie was fun, engaging and I really loved all the characters. There were some moments that I'm not 100% sure about, but the movie had so much to offer I need a second helping to full digest it. It's very much a movie for a younger generation and it's about the NEW cast, for me that's wonderful as the old cast had their time in the sun and they are helping to world build and bring in these new ones in the best ways possible.

Apparently this director is who is going to be ongoing. Argh.  Too much comedy, too much cgi, stupid subplot, FLOATING IN SPACE LEIA!!!! A ludicrous  middle story for the CODE BREAKER, Snoke is just a plot device with no back story, dumb bird things, shirtless EMO conflicted villians, modern superhero karate style saber fight scenes, a lame Luke death.<br/><br/>I suspect the scene with Leia will be the 'nuke the fridge' 'jump the shark' moment on the internet once the hype dies</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
