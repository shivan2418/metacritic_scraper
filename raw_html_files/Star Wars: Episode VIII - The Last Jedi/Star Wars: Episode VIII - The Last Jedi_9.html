I liked the new characters and was very excited to see where this story was going. I left the Last Jedi feeling confused, and angry. Everything that came before it was ignored. The humor was out of place. The pacing was terrible. There were some nice scenes with Kilo and Rey, but all in all, too many un-answered questions, unnecessary and highly unlikeable new characters, and just bad storytelling. The entire casino side plot was an eye-rolling mess. And what was the point of killing Admiral Ackbar (one of the universe's most beloved characters) offscreen? Its a tragedy this had to be Mark and Carries last film. So horribly disappointing. I wish I could un-see it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The second thing is the complete subversion of a glorious work of fiction that is Star Wars. This is not a "reboot". It is a smudge, a stain, a wreck, a catastrophe. This is a completely artless science fiction movie. It is an a la carte DIY movie put together in a way that must have seemed just neat or cool to somebody. A series of strung-together scenarios that must have seemed really good as a storyboard at some point. Or a bunch of clipped-together comic books.<br/><br/>And the tone is all over the place. There is levity, then there is supposed to be some gravity, then there is supposed to be some fancy. The problem is that these transitions occur not just within the movie but within *individual scenes*.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

After my viewing, the film left me with plenty to think about, so I went online to find critical and audience responses.  What I found interested me: there was a significant disconnect between the reaction the vocal fans of the Star Wars franchise and that of the professional critics who reviewed TLJ. With few exceptions, the critical response to TLJ  has been very positive.  The fan’s consensus however, has been ambivalent at best.  Some more outspoken among that latter camp have derided the movie as a, “Hate letter to fans,” or have posted volgs titled, “The Rot at The Core of Star Wars.”  Looking into the causes of this disparity, I find that many authors posit that the longtime fanbase—predominantly white males—feel threatened by the large number of prominent women and nonwhite characters featured in the cast.  While in many cases this is true, (I recall an IMDB audience review that labeled newcomer Rose as, “Positive Body Image Girl,”) I find it a shallow and dismissive theory in most cases.  When I viewed Last Jedi, I saw a film that was exciting and mechanically excellent with only a handful of visual miscues.  At the same time, I saw a film that is nowhere near as socially progressive and empowering as it gets credit for and it squanders every possible opportunity to depict a better, more exciting story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The result is a surprisingly ponderous outing - more like Lost in Space than Star Wars. The way characters seem to talk at each other rather than to each other is both frustrating and unengaging. Better summarised elsewhere as a sort of 'galactic wheel-spin', none of the array of often irrelevant sub-plots ever lead anywhere, playing the 'it isn't what you thought' card again and again, but crucially without bringing anything truly new to the table. Because of this, its extremely glib treatment of the material often falls flat and its self-aware humour tends to undermine what dramatic tension remains. While the film is at pains to 'throw away' and 'kill' the past mythology built up by George Lucas, what there is leans heavily on its tropes and imagery. The final image of dreaming youth almost suggests that what we have here is a multi-million dollar fan film - but one that forgets to inspire the same dreams and feelings in its audience. Since the film leaves you not knowing what the resistance or the first order are for and really not caring anyway, the story just seems to fade and patter out (just like one of its principle characters), rather than leave you wanting more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The story was uncreative with bland heroes and villains. Luke Skywalker is now scared of Kylo Ren. That is way outside his character. How could they screw up Luke Skywalker? I swear that Disney is bribing the critics to give it high scores. They need to repay us fans by writing two more actual movies. They should just let an autistic two-year-old write Star Wars. It would end up better that way. F*ck you Disney.  This isn't even an opinion. This is fact. This movie is objectively bad. Do not waste your money on this. This gets a zero. I've never trusted professional critics and will never trust them ever.<br/><br/>To the "people" who submitted the 2,424 positive user reviews, I genuinely hope you either kill yourself or get some medical attention immediately. My opinion on this movie will not change, no matter what Rian Johnson or my liberal parents say.

This movie has noticeable problems, but it is not even close to the same level as Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones in terms of quality. This movie is okay, not great or horrid, just simply okay. I loved the acting (especially Ridley and Driver as Rey and Ren). The action set pieces (namely the last one), CG, and practical effects were grand as per usual in Star Wars movies. Plus, it added some interesting insight into the jedi, sith, and the force through Luke's scenes. However, there are two major problems to talk about: plot conveniences (ex-machinas) and the fact the story was far too safe by the end of the film. There are far too many conveniences with regard to things like the force and BB-8 (after you've seen the film, you'll understand) that move the plot forward when they really should not and come off as lazy writing. It also happens to make these characters look invincible with no stakes or sense of danger. With regard to my second argument, after a certain event which I will not spoil, I thought the story and universe could shift drastically and truly create a unique Star Wars film unlike any before. In the end, though, it abandons that risk completely and takes the low hanging fruit instead. Long story short, I feel a better story could have arose from these concepts and the questions left unanswered or answered poorly in this film from TFA. Overall, I did enjoy my time watching this movie, but it was far from great. However, I am concerned about the future of the franchise and the overreaction by this fanbase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Seriously the super powerful evil mastermind killed that way?<br/>the list could go on and on...<br/><br/>Basically there was a quote in the moive which said something like "To build a new world you have to burn the old one".

Great cinematography, decent music, good special effects. Poorly done cliched plot. Some good individual scenes though. The sequel trilogy plot as a whole is ruined now due to Carrie Fisher's death and the decision to leave the movie exactly the same after her death will further compound the issue for Episode IX. It was quite disappointing as a whole and has led me to truly treat Disney-Wars as the fanfiction that it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's very questionable when big actors like Mark Hamil have given up and are willing to admit it's basically crap but even just watching the angry joe review on youtube reveals several horrible problems with the movie. They have unlikeable characters shoe horned in like finn and rose who progress the story so little and have the typical relationship of true love in under 12 hours of knowing one another. There's problems for start to finish whether it's the sith becoming ever more encapsulated into stereotypical roles (like the sith apprentices becoming angsty and senseless, sweaty teens along with the old masters being ugly, old and decrepit megalomaniacs, both with no real logic or personality past being crazy selfish) or even the Jedi being short in number but having no interesting characters either. Luke is all over the place (no wonder Mark Hamil seemed depressed) and becomes an indecisive mess who does very little throughout the whole movie and pulls out one trick right at the end before disappearing. Rey has more skill and capability with no training than Luke ever did, random love scenes, terrible sub plots and sadly the direction of the movies leaves little hope for a quick resolution to all this. They have really run the old series through the mud with Luke being the polar opposite of what he should be, powers coming out of nowhere and being illogical and so many other issues. I am sad to say that even I (a complete shill who normally buys anything to support series he likes) won't be buying this movie when it comes out. Even phasma, Kylo Ren and Snoke have poor performances with nothing to lead you to care or want to see what happens next. I feel Disney have really upset the balance of the force here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The general consensus was that the movie was too long, hard to follow in spots, and generally just not that entertaining.  I have decided this will be the last $ that the Star Wars franchise will get out of us.  There are just too many other truly great movies out there to spend ones time enjoying than this disney-made-mess of a movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Didn't read anything about it, didn't follow it at all.<br/><br/>The greatest improvement of The Last Jedi over The Force Awakens is that it didn't copy it's original trilogy counterpart as much, though there were still plenty of plagiarized scenes with throw away lines that tried to unconvincingly tell you that this is totally not the same as Empire.<br/><br/>The visuals were gorgeous, and there were a couple of real heartwarming moments, but once you've seen it, your mind will start to review what you've seen and come to the conclusion that in all other ways this movie is basically a tire fire.<br/><br/>Mark Hamill's return as the grumpy old Luke-alike was well done and I thoroughly enjoyed him, as long as you ignore that all of the events leading up to his self-exile were an enormous character assassination.<br/><br/>Rey is more of a Mary Sue now than even the definition of the trope can explain because it's amplified by her ridiculous mastery of the Force... but she is charming, like a Mary Sue should be.<br/><br/>Finn and Rose's entire subplot might as well not exist and the movie would have been better served using the 40 minutes of that on actually making the rest good and filling in the plot chasms.<br/><br/>Poe Dameron was OK. Under the circumstances he was behaving like any critically thinking person should, even though the movie will try to tell you otherwise.<br/><br/>The writing, structure, and editing of this movie is easily the worst of any Star Wars. Cringe worthy lines occur regularly, and stupid jokes that break dramatic scenes and then don't land well for most of the audience are sprinkled throughout. Character development is basically non-existent for anybody, new or old. It basically insults your intelligence but you don't notice at the time because of the eye candy.<br/><br/>World building that keeps the fantastical elements of Star Wars within reason and believable has gone completely out the window for the sake of spectacle. I guess if you wanted to distance your Star Wars from old Star Wars you would do something like this movie, but it can't even maintain continuity within itself, let alone from its direct prequel. It breaks all of the rules of Star Wars that keep it grounded in a believable world. It's like the director looked at what was done before, lit it all on fire, and wrote his own fan fiction.<br/><br/>Plot points and teasers set up in Force Awakens go untouched, or blatantly discarded. Who's Snoke and where did he come from? Doesn't matter, he's out. Rey's parents? Forget it, they are nobody. Kylo's mask and his persona of intimidation? Get rid of it because the old guy made fun of him. Finn got his spine raked by a lightsaber and goes into a coma? Nah he wakes up and shows no signs of being injured at all despite the fact that the time between the two movies appears to be less than a week. Why would Luke leave a map to find him if he left to go die in a corner? Captain Phasma? Still a non-character with like 4 lines between two movies; a shiny suit to sell merchandise that may as well not even have anybody inside and it wouldn't make a difference (strong female characters ftw?).  Knights of Ren? Who now? Nobody came after you sent the distress call? No duh. Hyperspace travel isn't instantaneous, and you gave them all of 5 minutes to get there before leaving.<br/><br/>This movie didn't just take a dump on the original trilogy, it took a dump on its own trilogy. I wasn't a fan of FA because I walked out of it thinking, "I've seen this movie already." It was just A New Hope with modern visuals, and I guess some people are fine with that (I can't fault the visuals), but I wanted new content. In hindsight, however, The Last Jedi is inferior to The Force Awakens in every way, which is the saddest story of all. JJ Abrams will try to repair what has been done by this movie, but he will fail spectacularly because Rian Johnson is a complete tool.<br/><br/>This new trilogy is officially not Star Wars to me. I just don't care about anything in it. The story is completely inconsequential and I don't care about any of these characters or what they're going to do now. It's not canon. The real canon is the Expanded Universe and TV series. This new stuff is children playing with forces they don't understand.<br/><br/>1 point for Mark Hamill's performance.<br/>1 point for production values.<br/>1 point for Rian Johnson not doing EP9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And that is to be expected. I myself enjoyed it, though it is not at all what I expected and nothing like the old canon. And that is the most divisive thing.<br/><br/>I loved the music, the story, most of the characters, and the action/visuals were fantastic.<br/><br/>I did not like *any* of Canto Bight - it felt far too ancillary with no bearing on the plot. Though I did really like Finn and Rose as characters. Why were there zero returning species? Why make them all unseen species? That particularly felt disruptive and causes a broken connection to the larger Saga.<br/><br/>My only other major dislike is that Phasma was once again terribly handled and just tossed away like trash. So much potential for a very cool character wasted.<br/><br/>Overall, 8 is one of my favorite Star Wars films now - behind 6, 5, and Rogue One.

Rian Johnson is a complete A$$ destroyed all story and plot elements established in previous films and left it almost no where to go now. DISGRACEFUL what they did to Mark Hamills character Luke Skywalker. He clearly hated the direction of his character and the movies, what a waist no imagination what so ever. I do not care about any of the remaining characters, even Rey isnt related to anyone she is a nobody, so why should we give a Shi*    No point going into any more details this movie was disgusting, hopefully J.J. Abrams can fix this cluster FUC* for the last movie. RIAN JOHNSON should never have anything to do with any movies or tv shows or any form of entertainment ever again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm just going to break it down into bullets:<br/>Pros:<br/>-Capable female protagonist*<br/>-Diverse cast+<br/>-Top-tier special effects<br/>-Cool locations<br/>-OK pacing<br/>-Luke Skywalker nostalgia 4 evah<br/>-I liked Admiral Holdo. Fight me.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>*Rey and Rose edge precariously close to Mary Sue territory. Rey being a complete Force-badass despite very little formal training (although I'm glad she's not descended from 'Force royalty' because it implies that the universe may be full of Force-sensitive people just waiting to discover their potential, a la the kid at the end). Rose was underdeveloped and her planting a kiss on Finn just felt...ugh.<br/>+I love that *some* people are collectively loosing their she-it over the "PC" and "SWJ pandering" because the idea of black people and women in their precious space opera franchise ruins their childhood. However, sweet MRA tears are no excuse for bad writing and one-dimensional characters. Also, it would be nice if we can get away from the trope that all space villains must be space Nazis. It's such a low-hanging fruit at this point.<br/>-TLJ is rife with plot holes large enough to fly an X-wing through. Not a Dreadnaught mind you, but still enough to give you a headache if you choose to pay attention. You'll be fine if you suspend your disbelief and lower your expectations a notch.<br/>-The Canto Bight subplot could--should have been cut. Full stop.<br/>-I felt kind of cheated at the end because none of the main characters (Poe, Finn, Rey, Leia, Kylo, or Chewbacca) died. Not because I'm a sadist who likes seeing people die, but it seemed like the ancillary characters (Rose's sister Paige, Admiral Akbar [RIP], Holdo, the poor schlubs in the escape craft) were the ones to suffer the consequences of Poe's insubordination, Leia's inability to communicate her and Holdo's escape plan, and Finn and Rose's misjudgment of DJ. Honestly, I kind of wish that Rose hadn't intercepted Finn's kamikaze moment with the laser cannon. This leads to my next gripe:<br/>-If Finn had sacrificed himself and destroyed the cannon, it would have spared Luke from doing the whole "I'm a punchy hologram" thing. Don't get me wrong-- his moment with Leia was beautiful and the fight was badass, but him Force-projecting from across the galaxy was a real stretch. Now he's dead, Rey has no master to teach her (is it too much to ask for a main character to actually work for their skill?)<br/>-Snoke. What was his deal? I guess we'll never know.<br/>-Like it's been said by countless others-- why not lightspeed-jump-smash the Destroyer in the first place? Was that always an option?? Overall, the takeaway I got from this film is that Disney had decided that the Star Wars franchise is for the young, new consumers and not the diehard fans of the original movies. I think it's great that kids are getting a more inclusive story that they can grow attached to the way older generations have. I just hope that the complex themes  are explored in a thoughtful way without oversimplifying them with a binary good-bad, light-dark, Jedi-Sith modality that is easier on the 'younger' demographics. After TLJ my expectations have been permanently lowered, and I'm not even mad. Disappointed, but not mad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Then a brief premonition that theres a small but possible chance his pupil - a jed - has a small amount of darkness in him.  His solution?  Ill butcher him in his sleep.  Well done Disney.

I agree with many reviews, but i don't in somethings. The characters are good and the roles too, but it needs more development in their stories and personalities. Snoke's death with no informations of his story is disappointing, but the way Kylo does this brings a great moment for movie.

You may like it or dislike it but it is not all over the shop like the prequel trilogy. It is better than Awakening for sure.<br/><br/>It is hard going over this film without spoilers. Yes, a few decision they took in the film and some scenes could have been done better. Overall, it is an interesting novel trajectory. I like Laura Dern and Benicio in this film. Finally, great underappreciated actors getting some action.<br/><br/>This is a solid 7/10 film, no without its flaws but with a few interesting surprises. It has good atmosphere and flow. Step in the right direction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The occasion gags felt forced and out of place for the tension that was trying to build. It did nothing to grow the cardboard characters that were one dimensional and disposable.<br/><br/>We are supposed to be mad at Poe for taking down the dreadnought (which could have destroyed the resistance cruiser during the space chase) yet cheer Rose as she stops Finn from protecting... those he loved. The plot was heavily dependent on Mcguffin after Mcgufffin, more so than any other film I have seen recently. I wasn't as concerned about Luke's fate or Leia's force prowess as others point out but I think Star Wars needs a good injection of new. However, this hackneyed drivel with a memorable positive one liner here and there was not it for me. The movie did nothing to draw me in. The remaining villains were too goofy to make me feel like I should be on the edge of my seat worried about the fate of the resistance. Hopefully, Rian Johnson will take his movie's message to heart and learn form this failure of storytelling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are things that I absolutely loved about the movie, and there are things that I not only strongly disliked but kinda ruined Star Wars as a saga for me. Visually, the movie is a masterpiece. The action is awesome; however, I wish so badly that they would bring back grand and epic scale lightsaber battles like in the prequels. The movie gave some great character depth to Kylo Ren and Rey, which I enjoyed. Now, one thing I hated is that they ruined the character of Luke Skywalker. I understand he's a changed man because of the events that are explained in this movie, but his actions are not like him at all. The Leia force reveal was both cool and laughably cheesy at the same time, so I don't know how I feel about that. The death of Snoke absurdly disappointing. Rey's parental reveal was a huge slap in the face to the audience and fans. The ENTIRE Finn and Rose plot should've been removed. It did nothing to further the story in any way whatsoever. If you took it out completely, not only would the plot remain unaffected, but the movie would actually be better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie is more light-hearted with well-timed humor paced into a memorable sci-fi action movie. I expected a rehash of Empire Strikes back in the sense that TFA was a New Hope rehash. Nope! Largely original. Yes there are some great easter eggs from Empire Strikes Back scattered throughout, and I cant wait to watch this movie again to find more. However, this movie is not all light-heart humor. There is narrative to develop the new characters of Rey, Finn, and Kylo that makes these characters far more interesting. I'm actually interested in what's going to happen to these characters now after Last Jedi, whereas I was just "meh" with them after Force Awakens. I enjoyed the direction they took for Luke's character. In fact, a lot of his story to me is an Easter Egg from Empire Strikes Back. The action sequence towards the end of Last Jedi actually made me nostalgic for the original trilogy in a way I didn't feel in TFA or even the second trilogy. I'm glad Rian Johnson is making his own Star Wars Trilogy. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Interactions that lasted a little too long or felt just a little off. However, the whole of the movie is far better then the parts say it should be. There are so many parts that are so good. However this review has to stay short so I will only cover four.<br/><br/>I love the fact that it destroyed the whole Skywalker bloodline as being the center of the movie and universe. The fact that Rey supposedly is not anyone special, that her family were just drunks means you don’t have to be a Solo or a Skywalker to have the Force choose you or to be able to wield it. Some say that isn’t what the movie says, but I just leave the example of the child at the end using the force to pick up the broom.<br/><br/>I love the fact that Kylo Ren is an obvious stand in for the whiney alt-right man babies. He whines about the same things and throws the same kind of fits. His callous disregard for Rey being uncomfortable with him being shirtless is just one small, tiny example that encapsulates the alt-right self-importance. The whole crying about remaking the empire sparks that same MAGA concept the racists/sexist crowd in real life spouts. It is perfect movie model of real life.<br/><br/>I also am ecstatic that it destroys the expanded universe of Star Wars. I am sorry everyone, but I am old enough to have read those books when they came out but the vast majority of them SUCKED. I mean absolutely sucked with no redeeming quality. I am glad to sacrifice the few good things to get rid of the rest of that garbage. I like that Disney is making a clean slate to entertain and tell a story about that universe, especially once SW IX is done.<br/><br/>However, the final part and best part is making space for people who aren’t white males as heroes and as the center of the story. This is coming from a white male, I am damn tired of the same old tired stories that don’t give everyone else a chance in the spotlight. I can easily watch and love something that has women, alternate orientations, and people of color as the stars. I can identify them as someone to look up to. This benefits everyone, gives us a richer field to choose movies from and puts everyone on the same footing.  I look forward to more of this and I will happily spend my hard earned money supporting these ventures.<br/><br/>The good: The wide range of actors and actresses, the opening up of the universe, and just about everything SJW this movie does.<br/><br/>The bad: There were little things that bothered me, but nothing any other movie would have done. The biggest bad of this is having to wait 2 more years for SW IX.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

However, they are poorly implemented resulting in pacing issues, exposition dumps and an abusive reliance on subversion to convey character arcs. In short, the script feels like an A-Ha! moment that wasn't given the time it needed for refinement. The use of subversion is so pervasive that one may feel they are watching a critique on the franchise rather than a fictional narrative. It perhaps needed to be divided amongst the three films to ease viewers into the change. The reaction amongst most fans seems to be in line with the film's core message however, so perhaps it's a masterpiece from that perspective but certainly not from a cinematic point of view. There are some highlights, mainly through the action sequences and the actors do their best with what's written, except when considering comedy. The humour is akin to a late show skit when actors parody their characters through modern day vernacular and real-life scenarios. It regularly broke my immersion and what's worse was poorly edited, often dragging well beyond the non-existent punchlines. Overall, it exposed a dearth of comedic nous from the creators and wasn't in line with usual Star Wars sense of humour which is one aspect that didn't need an overhaul. I write as a lover of film, not Star Wars. I enjoy most of the franchise and I've seen every entry yet am unconcerned if I ever see them again. I am disappointed with this latest entry because it showed potential but didn't know how to treat it. Apart from one scene in the Third Act that stirred me, I was bored. That said, if you like to be taken out of your comfort zone and are unconcerned about what does or does not make good cinema then you may find something to value from The Last Jedi. It's not a terrible film, but as I've stated it's certainly not the best version of itself it could've been; great ideas, sub-par execution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Last Jedi brought so many good things in this installment, including new characters, brand new backstories, and a direction that may inevitably impact future Star Wars movies in general. Since this film is directed by the guy that directed Looper and few episodes of my all-time favorite show Breaking Bad (Rian Johnson), has brought in a very unique approach that made this latest installment very mature than The Force Awakens. After seeing this film, I was blown away of how epic and surreal that movie has turned out to be when it comes to the action intensity, performances, and the sound mixing. This film is awesome compared to Empire Strikes Back, but not as masterful as The New Hope. And Disney.... please don't ruin Star Wars!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

At the same time I left feeling bothered. A kind of itch in the back of my sensibility. Something I couldn't put my finger on. I thought about it all night and into the next day. So I decided I would write out the plot on paper to get out everything i still had in my memory bank. As I wrote I began to see more and more clearly the reasons why I felt the way I did. I felt this way after the first 10 minutes of Aliens 3. I loved Alien and Aliens. Ripley had taken us on a compelling and exciting journey and we left feeling satisfied. I loved the surviving characters that were left at the end of part 2 and felt satisfied that they made it through. And then at the beginning of part 3, the writers kill off every beloved character and impregnate Ripley with an alien so she could die in the way she feared most. This is what The Last Jedi felt like. I wont get into the caricatures they made of every character or the plot holes or the story inconsistencies. But they all exist. and I understand. I think i know why. I think we are at a unique point in history. So much awareness and understanding is exploding in this country. We need more movies where all the women are heroes and martyrs and powerful. And we need more movies where men are shown to be men. reckless and angry and wishy washy and cowardly and power hungry and animal abusers and bullies. I believe there are ways to convey all of this. There are many really good movies that have been doing this wonderfully. But I think with the Last Jedi they tried but failed. I will say that it was alot of fun to see visually. It was gorgeously shot. There were a few very creative ways they expanded the mythology and universe that i really appreciated. The action sequences were riveting. The lightsaber fights were amazing. But I wish it was a different movie. I would say go see it and if you leave thinking it wasn't bad but it wasn't great, leave it there and don't overthink it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But all ready at the first scene something was not right, Poe calling Hux was a horrible cringe moment and from there it just got worse with the jokes, they might work in the marvel universe but it does not work in Star Wars.  The horrible story arc of Finn and Rose which was a complete waste of time, the Canto Bight scene all for the sake of watching a little kid force pull a broom in the end and at the moment when Finn actually have a good scene trying to stop the big Laser its ruined by Rose, which then goes on to deliver the most cringy speech ever in a star wars movie. Now comes the question how did they not get shot to piece by the walkers as they crashed very close to them ..?? horrible writing.<br/>The story Arc of Luke is also very disappointing, I wont even go into detail but it is just awfull. The story of Kylo is that he still a whiny EMO which is on purpose to make Rey look better and here comes the Kathleen Kennedy influence. Rey is just Meeeehh there is no reason to relate to her because its obvious that she is female version of Luke but much more bland and no depth. And ooohhh the plot holes here we go. Why didn't Holdo just tell Poe what the plan was..?? Why would Luke try to kill his Nephew because he saw some darkness in him, considering how he would not stop to try and turn a much more evil being that he barely knew..??<br/>How could Snoke escape Darth Sidious and Darth Vader clearly he was strong in the force and had experienced the rise and fall of the empire which means the 2 sith lords should have sensed him, where did his dark side training come from..??<br/>Where are the knights of Ren..??<br/>Why didn't the resistance not just use the 2 fregats that ran out of fuel as weapons like Holdo did with the last cruiser..?? There are many many more points that makes this movie so disappointing but I will end here.<br/>Overall it was such an disappointment to watch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I didn't go any deeper cause I didn't want to get spoilers but after seeing it I don't think it was bad. I liked it!<br/><br/>I feel like most of the hate is from hardcore Star Wars fans who can't accept change in their franchises. It might be cause it's copying the original movies like Force Awakens was. Now we got them hating on people who liked the new one.<br/><br/>The whole movie kept my attention with plots twists going left and right. The characters for the most part were good. There were a few **** moments. The biggest for me was how Leia survived space. I didn't even know she had a small amount of the force.<br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of fans hated Luke dying. I felt if he was getting killed of that it made sense and he didn't go out like a punk.<br/><br/>There is some questions I hope the next and possibly last movie. The biggest is how will they write off Leia since Fisher is dead?<br/><br/>Overall, it was OK. Anyone who hates it must be mostly cause it's different from the original movies which is stupid. They should listen to the lesson they would trying to tell in this movie (Not sure if they did a good job to be honest) and let the past go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7999123"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This was the single worst movie that I have ever had the displeasure of seeing in a theater. I've never actually considered leaving a cinema before in my life. The reasons for which this movie is just horrible range from big picture to nitty gritty, from personal opinions to objectively bad decisions. I'll lay it out as such.<br/><br/>Objectively bad:<br/>- Fin and Rose's plot takes up half of the movie and accomplishes absolutely nothing.<br/>- General Gender Studies's plan to escape the ship doesn't make any sense: "We're just going to abandon ship in these transports and hope that the enemy - who has surrounded us and is watching our every move - doesn't notice dozens of ships leaving out of the hangar."<br/>- Fin actually tries to make himself useful near the end in what was about to probably be the best scene in the movie but Rose ruins it because "MUH LOVE INTEREST" or some such crap.<br/><br/>Personal Opinion:<br/>- Awful unfunny middle-school humor such as Poe's prank call in the beginning scene<br/>- Movie is saturated with jokes that don't ever allow us to take it seriously. For example, when Luke asks Rey where she is from and Rey says she's from nowhere, this is in the middle of an important conversation but Luke kills the mood with a poorly timed joke about Jakku really being nowhere.<br/>- There was no reason for Admiral Tumblr to hide her plan to her staff. It's clear that they just did this so that Poe would mutiny and so that they could use the moment to talk about "toxic masculinity" since that's what Poe's character has been reduced to in this movie.<br/>- Terrible acting overall. The characters speak like children. Remember in the casino scene when Fin is positively GAWWKING at the glamour of the place and can't even contain himself because apparently he's as excitable as a puppy on steroids? And when he and Rose find the generic master hacker they literally stop and stare and exclaim out loud "There he is! The master hacker!" Didn't anyone ever teach these idiots not to scream their intentions out loud?<br/>- Goddamn SUPER LEIA Nitty Gritty:<br/>- World War 2 style gravity bomb bays in SPACE<br/>- Multiple times where a ship is exposed to the vacuum of space without there being a forceful depressurization (leia coming back onto the ship, the last bomber in the opening scene literally having holes in it, the hangar of Snoke's ship still having air in it after getting shredded through by the Resistance flagship)<br/>-Rose's awful quote after "saving" Fin is objectively incorrect and stupid.<br/><br/>The only reason I give this movie a 2 rather than a 0 is because of a couple select moments which are good. I enjoyed Luke's force apparition near the end and I thought it was cool when Vice Admiral Vag went full 9/11 on Snoke's ship. That said I would have preferred if Luke had actually been at his death in person, and I think it would have been better if it was Admiral Ackbar who went "Allahu Ackbar!" rather than Field Marshall Feminist but whatever at least those moments were still cool.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Massive spoiler’s are to be found below.<br/><br/>Major plot points built up in The Force Awakens are just thrown out without any regard for delivering a satisfying reveal to the audience. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars to take a large family to two movies and spent over four hours of my life watching their movies. This is poor story telling.<br/><br/>The story telling sells out the importance of the previous six movies in a similar manner! The Jedi order is meaningless, and their legacy is not worth passing on. The previous battle against empire was all for nothing, and none of their sacrifices matter! This is bad story telling. Admiral Akbar had no reason to be in the film. Like everything else they name dropped him and he was there only to be killed off. Why even put him in the film at all?<br/>Snoke was useless and a buffoon. He was just a cartoon villain that cackled until he was effortlessly defeated by a brat. The character looked terrible in this movie too. Just a waste of time and money. Captain Phasma was completely wasted as a character. The character served a purpose yes, but the purpose would have been much better had Phasma been used to any effect at all. I feel bad for Daisy Ridley. I have no idea if she can act or not. Her character hasn’t had any development as she is going to succeed at everything that she tries. Rey has the depth of a wooden fence post. This is a problem with the story itself. Luke failed for two movies in a row before he got it right. Rey hasn’t really needed to learn anything. And she didn’t learn anything in this film either. Well she did learn one thing. She is an unimportant nobody and that’s it. Kylo Ren is something like taking the worst parts of episodes 2 and 3, then telling the actor to ignore anything else. Again, this is a story telling problem. I haven’t got a clue whether Adam Driver can act based on these Star Wars movies any more so than with his counterpart. They bring back Yoda. And they have him say that the old Jedi order was not worth worrying about, but to follow your heart. You know who else said that? Palpatine… Now based on the merits of this movie alone it’s one of my favorite scenes in this film. But that doesn’t mean that it’s objectively good! Compared to couch lint cat food smells more edible.<br/>This movie is just about tarnishing Luke’s legacy. They have taken the previous hero of three movies, one that completed his hero journey, and then Disney beats him like a piñata hoping for cash to fall out. Why bring the old guard back if you just want to ruin their character’s and kill them off? Luke got off easy in this, only Luke and one other character got to be real heroes. Finn is nothing more than a loser and to top it off he is denied his chance to prove he has metal. Yeah he kills Phasma, but that’s not much harder than killing any old storm trooper. And those are cheaper by the dozen.<br/><br/>This movie was not a good Star Wars movie. The main issue for most of the movie is a situation that is handled very poorly due to questionable writing. The sub plots that come about because of this situation are silly and suffer from questionable writing as well. They commit the worst sin of any form of entertainment. They are so boring that only the main plot with Rey and Luke made me stay in the theater seat at all. But this plot didn’t leave a good taste in my mouth either. I’ve seen better science fiction from late night TV in the 90s. Whatever they pay these writers, they should go and buy some rights to fan fiction and save the money. It’ll pay for another few frames of CGI I’m sure. There is such a thing as suspension of disbelief. They couldn’t maintain mine during a Star Wars movie. That’s a bad sign of things to come. They have completely closed themselves off without any real setup for the next and final movie in this trilogy. I don’t care about Rey and Kylo fighting. Rey has already beaten him in The Force Awakens. She seems like she wants to redeem him, but that leaves me disinterested. There isn’t any other plot that was left to setup the next film. This is not good story telling. They didn’t do anything to make me want to go to the theater for the last movie in this trilogy. Everyone that I was rooting for is either dead, made a fool of, been shown to be jerks, or I know that they are in no way a threat and will surely win against any odds. There is one more thing. In fact, it may be the most important thing of all for any movie that claims to be in the Star Wars franchise. Two light sabers never clashed in combat. That’s right, a Star Wars movie without a light saber duel. Many here will claim this is wrong, however they are calling a scene a duel when it is clearly something else. Even the Phantom Menace had a duel!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8068803"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This movie defies all expectations - not by exceeding them, but rather by tossing them into the trash compactor. The force is treated with little respect (I am aware it's a fantasy story) and the Skywalker bloodline is made irrelevant; anyone can be a Jedi with little to no training. By the way we are to now to ponder in a postmodern sense about whether the Jedi are ultimately a good thing. We are treated to not-so-subtle lessons in how terrible men are at leading and accomplishment, while simultaneously drilled on how great women are at all things. The larger than life mastermind of the wannabe Empire is dispatched as if he were nonessential to the plot of the new trilogy. The same fate befalls the underused Boba Fe.... I mean Captain Phasma. Finn, who really needs a good story line, is now sent to an ultimately useless mission that spins as an on the nose / finger wagging moral lesson on war and greed. His pal is a new character created to ensure sales for the international market. BB8 isn't even developed beyond a couple of quick scenes, but Chewbacca does make a cameo near the beginning an end. It's as if the director wants to say to all of the fans, "Star Wars is silly and forgettable, laugh at Luke drinking milk from the teat of a sea cow and shut up!" It is an epic troll, a spit in the face of the spirit of the original trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Super-boring slow speed spaceship chase that lasts half the movie.  Unlike many of the negative reviews here, I'm not a super pissed fanboy, just a movie goer who expected so much more  (like a good story that makes sense and that has motivation for all characters).

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_8079436"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">George Lucas has his revenge now that Rian Johnson has made the worst Star Wars film of all time.<br/><br/>After the prequels were completed, George Lucas refused to make another Star Wars film. The fans were upset about the CG in the film and upset that George Lucas felt that Jar Jar Binks was a great character - the fans thought Jar Jar was annoying. After seeing The Last Jedi, however, I only have one thing to say, “George Lucas, you are forgiven.”  It is only fitting that George Lucas has his revenge and make his hero’s journey triumphant to Star Wars and that the fans are more upset with Rian Johnson who was given almost full artistic control of the script mess that is The Last Jedi.<br/><br/>After viewing The Last Jedi I felt like quoting Ben Kenobi, “I sensed as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.” It's also as if a fandom was upset, if only slightly because it is the greatest franchise in history, and it seemed like the script was written by a man who is not a Star Wars fan.<br/><br/>The script is what I feel to be the biggest problem with the film. The character ‘modification’ of Luke, everyone’s favorite Jedi is unnecessary to advance the plot. In this ‘exciting’ script, Luke goes against the Jedi way and apparently tries to kill Leia’s defenseless child and later is reduced to a weak old geezer who’s daily chore is to milk an alien space cow for greenish milk so that he could drink it in a glamorous way like the Got Milk commercials so that the audience would think its ‘funny’. Let me tell you something Rian, having the greatest Jedi of all time drink green milk in a glamorous way is not ’funny’ lol. Actually, I’m laughing that it will probably be the highlight of the film and should have been in the trailer, but I do find this lack of character continuity disturbing. Another problem is that Chewy is a morbid porg killer which also seems unnecessary to advance the plot and out of character, eating the cute pets that live in the Millenium Falcon. All of these story elements just don’t seem very Disney, tho they bought the Star Wars Franchise and they do have the right to totally mess up Star Wars if they desire, which I am sure is their complete diabolical vision for Star Wars. Perhaps most interesting of my theatre experience of watching The Last Jedi wasn’t on screen, but it was something I’ve never seen before. A man was on his cell phone the entire time in the theatre and nobody said anything. He left halfway thru but then came back for some reason just to surf on his cellphone during the movie. Its as if he didn’t want to leave but also didn’t want to partially miss the movie while looking up from his cellphone every 15 minutes. I am surprised no one said anything to him about his cell phone during the film but now I empathize with him and I’m sure the whole audience understands now what he understood then. This film is an entire snooze-fest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Regardless of any legitimate criticism of Lucas, his contributions were the DNA of what made Star Wars great fun.  What were those things: structure is serial comic book/science fantasy, had lots of detail around military/robotic/speeder/weapons hardware to geek out with, had heroes and villains that were fun interesting characters, alluded to deep history of the Star Wars universe with the Jedi that kept peace for a thousand generations which gave a mystical feel to the Star Wars lore.  Last Jedi destroyed almost all of that.  It now seems like modern pseudo-intellectual secular humanist anti-dogma dogma with some shallow preachy social commentary tacked on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie, while having some problems with tone and pacing, doesn't deserve the level of vitriol being thrown against it.  Admittedly, I understand.  For awhile I was right there with everyone who is posting negative reviews.  I even created an account and rated it low.  Like Mark Hamill, I initially fundamentally disagreed with the direction that took Luke's character.  But then I saw it again and like Hamill, I appreciated the nuance and development that was expressed.  It took a second viewing to understand what this movie did right and what it was trying to do.  This comes from a life long Star Wars fan.  I feel bad that I initially trashed it.  Watch it again and your perception may change. As I said, I disagree with some of the pacing and storyline decisions (purple hair, Canto Bight, some politicizing and Rose saving Finn I am looking at you) but this movie actually does a lot of things right and cleans the slate for the Star Wars universe to go in any direction.  We don't have a Vader clone in Kylo Ren, we don't have a carbon copy Palaptine.  We have a Skywalker that is a supreme commander and lowly woman from a backwater planet with no special lineage as the one standing against someone from a powerful bloodline. We have probably the best pilot we have seen in a Star Wars movie in Poe Dameron who is not an Antilles/Solo copy, who goes from brash hothead to capable leader.  We have an immensely outgunned resistance in a small "ark" trying to carry the light of hope.  Sure, there were issues.  There are always issues in Star Wars movies and anyone that says otherwise is looking through rose-colored glasses. This was the most nuanced and deep Star Wars movie that has been released and, when the dust settles and tempers calm, may go down as being on par with Empire in the future.<br/><br/>UPDATE 1 I would like to offer a rebuttal against some of the criticisms suggesting that the Last Jedi was merely a feminist hit piece against  masculinity. Although, I understand how someone can try to make that claim,  bear in mind that , toward the end of movie, Leia when asked for guidance by the surviving resistance points to Poe and says "follow him".  I don't believe that this was an attack on masculinity but a lesson on wisdom versus recklessness and what it takes to be a leader.  Remember that in Return of the Jedi, Yoda had the same lesson for Luke ("You are reckless").  He wasn't attacking Luke's masculinity but his immaturity.   This lesson, whether it comes form a female character or a little green puppet, is a timeless one.  UPDATE 2 Let's talk about Luke since this seems to be one of the main reasons that people are disliking the movie.  As I said above, initially, I was right there with everyone.  I thought they utterly screwed up his character and I was pissed.  So pissed in fact, that I made account on review sites, trashed the move and signed a dumb petition.  But I was wrong.  Think about it this way..  Who hasn't contemplated what they would do if they could go back in time and kill Hitler before he rose to power.  That's the dilema that Luke was facing.   It's not, as some suggest, that he sensed a little bit of darkness in Ben and decided to go full-on murder spree.  Yes.  This is the man who sacrificed everything to save his father.  This is the man who, for the duration of the OT trusted his instincts  (They "served him well").  In that moment, he saw what Kylo would become.  A tyrant that would undo everything that he and his friends fought and lost so much for.  Someone that could plunge the galaxy into a new dictatorship, killing millions and bringing darkness.  For one second, his instincts told him to strike him down.  But you know what?  This is a wiser Luke, still human and flawed but someone who now knows that following "feelings" isn't always the best course of action.  You need wisdom and patience.  He might have thought about it for one second but that second passes.  Is this really out of character or does it show a very nuanced character growth?  For me, after thinking it through, it shows the latter.<br/><br/>Some people had a problem with him not showing up in person to defend the resistance against the First Order.  First, I don't think he could, his X-wing seemed to be beyond repair at the point but, more importantly, what he did reflected the wisdom of a Jedi Master.   If he showed up, one of two things would have happened.  He would have either killed Kylo Ren robbing him of any redemption or he would have been struck down, robbing the resistance of any remaining hope that they had.  By projecting himself, across the galaxy, he not only showed himself to be the most powerful force user that we have ever seen, he also became something more than a man. He became a symbol and a legendary hero.  Is that really a bad way to end Luke's journey?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In terms of bad aspects, it's got it all: a boring story, plot holes, badly written characters, weak action, a lame musical score (especially compared to earlier Star Wars Episodes), forced humour, and uninspired sets. On top of all of that, the movie really seems to have been made as a giant F*** you to star wars fans. There is ZERO payoff to what was set up in The Force Awakens. I wish I could give this movie a zero, that's how much I dislike it, but I can't. The Last Jedi does earn some points because from a technical standpoint, it's solid. Also, some of the actors give decent to good performances, considering what they have to work with.<br/><br/>It's funny to see how proud and pleased Rian Johnson is with himself. I wonder if he honestly believes he created an awesome cinematic achievement. He seems arrogant enough to believe it. And don't get me wrong, I'm not against something different and new. I like interesting changes and surprises in a movie, but that's as long as they work. None of the changes in The Last Jedi worked. They were all steaming turds that served to ruin this movie, and to destroy the story and characters that came before it.<br/><br/>Anyways, I could go on and on about how they ruined Luke Skywalker, how Rey is perfect at EVERYTHING, how lame Snoke is, how bad the subplots are, and all the logical inconsistencies... but I won't. I'll just say that the one good thing about this movie is that it feels like the end of a trilogy, and has a finality to it. Therefore, this will be the last Disney Star Wars movie that I see. For me, Star Wars is Episodes I-VI. Yes, I like the prequels, and they are so far superior to The Last Jedi that it's laughable. Too bad George Lucas ain't around anymore...<br/><br/>So, thanks Rian Johnson. Thank you for convincing me that I should save my time and money, and simply not watch any more Disney Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It has an excellent visual effects and an outstanding set design, a good overall story, and great musical score.  The movie drags slightly about half way through  but the first half is gripping and the movie finishes well.<br/>Could the movie been better if there was better script and Ms. Fisher, apparently ill, did not appear so lethargic?-- Yes.  But outstanding moments in the film make it a great experience at the movies. My experience was like the fun I had watching the original 3 Star Wars and the Force Awakens and unlike the disappointment with Rouge One and the prequels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Critics claim the movie is "subversive," but subversion without verisimilitude is meaningless. The correct term critics were looking for is "nihilistic." The only people who seem to like the movie are: A. People who have always found Star Wars annoying and enjoy seeing it be exposed to revisionism. B. People who are casual fans of science fiction/science fantasy. C. People who enjoy seeing their political views mirrored on screen, regardless as to how well written the plot and characters are surrounding the politics. All they want to see is their politics validated, character development be dammed--and I should note I agree with the politics behind the movie; I'm not some anti-SJW person. The who situation is just depressing, really. I won't be seeing any Disney Canon Star Wars® movies anymore. Extended Universe is the Real Canon, as far as I am concerned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

At all.<br/><br/>From it's opening minutes the script devolves into farce; there is a terrible monotony to the pacing of the writing where any potentially serious moment is immediately attempted to be lightened by an elementary school level joke. The audience is subjected to a non stop barrage of character assassinations, (the old guard in particular; Luke (he has to die, we get it, but the script missed a huge opportunity to send this character off), Leia (reduced to farce), but also the new characters suffer from a writer/director who has apparently completely failed to understand his audience.<br/><br/>In a bizarre directional choice any attempt at adding backstory to the significant players is wasted on a sub plot to rescue 'horses' that achieves nothing. Not even rescuing the 'horses'. They are simply left for dead. It's symbolic of the whole film.  As a pure piece of entertainment spectacle the film has also failed. The audience I was part of in Tokyo left the theater in a state of confusion and shock. Recently there have been some great Science Fiction films made (Bladerunner 2049, and further back Ex Machina). while these films inhabit a different genre, I mention them because of the consistency of their tone, the character development that takes place, and their ability to tell us a story we can invest in and carry beyond the theater.<br/><br/>In contrast The Last Jedi is totally forgettable. It fails as a comedy, a work of science fiction fantasy, and most importantly it fails as a coherent continuation of the film that proceeded it in the Star Wars story. I have rated it a 2 for it's technical and visual prowess. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone above the original trilogy or any alternative work of science fiction or fantasy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
