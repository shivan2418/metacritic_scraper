This is the first time I've bothered, because this movie is just THAT bad.<br/><br/>I went in with such high hopes. I've always admired RJ for his work, Looper and Brick in particular. Sadly, after watching The Last Jedi, that admiration has been tossed in the trash.<br/><br/>I found myself asking time after time, "did he even watch The Force Awakens?" Because it seems that he went out of his way to burn every bridge JJ built in TFA, without leaving any new ones behind. Mysteries are left unanswered or given shoddy, unsatisfying resolutions. Relationships and character quirks are completely ignored or ruined. The characters and their respective characterizations are just awful. They might as well have just renamed them all and made them new characters entirely. Rey, who I enjoyed in Force Awakens, spends the whole movie trying to reach through to a person who has done nothing but hurt her because, I don't know, she has some delusion of grandeur about being the Luke to his Vader, even though there's no realistic reason for her to believe this is possible. Her actions are naive, stupid and make no logical sense. And ultimately, it all just lands her back where she was in VII. The same can be said for nearly every other character, as none of them truly grow or develop. What a waste of potential. Don't even get me started on the brutal butchering of Luke Skywalker.<br/><br/>The plot, if you can even call it that, is rife with holes and inconsistencies. There's an entire subplot that has no bearing on the story and ultimately accomplishes nothing except taking up too much time and wasting Boyega's acting talents.<br/><br/>The humor is awkward and inappropriately timed. Did we really need a yo mama joke, or Luke milking a bizarre space creature, or shirtless Kylo Ren? RJ tries so hard to mimic Taika Waititi's comedic style, but lacks Waititi's wit and finesse, so it falls flat.<br/><br/>I wasn't completely thrilled with The Force Awakens, but I enjoyed it well enough. I walked away excited to see where these characters and this story were headed. I felt none of that leaving The Last Jedi. My investment in these characters and their story dissipated. I don't care what happens next. To paraphrase one of this movie's most disappointing characters, "for the sequel trilogy, all is lost."<br/><br/>I can only hope JJ turns things around in IX, but I'm not optimistic. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I'm immeasurably disappointed. What a mess of a film. Only adding the two points because it's visually stunning. If only that were enough to redeem the whole movie...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Massive disappointment and mismanagement of franchise with forced subplots to sell movies in Asia and sell new stuffed animals in stores. This movie was unfocused, sloppy, and utterly disregards plot leads from Episode VII. It was downright disrespectful of the Star Wars saga and established characters. Most of the jokes fell flat and were either strange (e.g. milk incident) or oddly placed in dialogues that undermined the film's legitimacy. There were GAPING PLOT HOLES throughout the film and truly cringeworthy moments - specifically, a moment were a main character flew through space. The fact that this movie is receiving positive reviews is baffling to me.  Perhaps it is just a reflection of how beloved the franchise is or how badly we wanted this to be a good movie.  We have to call this movie what it is so that Disney doesn't do this again.  They are a money-making machine and they need feedback to know what to make.  They need to hear , loud and clear, that this movie sucked. It's a damn shame and I hope J.J. Abrams can redeem this in Episode IX.  In the past, screenwriters 'jumped the shark' or 'nuked the fridge,' but I am suggesting that Rian Johnson 'milked the space-anteater' on this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Take the bombers from the opening scene; how can you even have a bomb bay on a spaceship? Do the bombs all have tiny rockets on them to make them "fall?" Snoke looks terrible; he looks like one of the monsters from  I am Legend stole a bathrobe from Caesar's Palace. Star Wars has traditionally given birth to some of the most iconic designs in all of cinema. The only new element which works on any level is the porg. These little guys seem to have had a clear vision behind their design and execution, and the result is both adorable and memorable. Granted, that vision was merchandise, but I'll give credit where credit is due.<br/>2) No Story - I can't even fathom trying to write a 4th grade book report on this script. So The Resistance is trying to destroy the First Order, a massive death cult with seemingly inexhaustible resources and manpower led by a mysterious and powerful figure whose personal motivations are never explained and who is now dead. His apprentice who killed him either wants to team up with Rey to rule the galaxy or murder her. Rey, who until very recently was deeply interested in learning the identity of her parents and the source of her connection with the Force, now has to decide if her love triangle with Finn and Kylo has become a love square with Rose, a rebel security guard/saboteur/pilot/social commentator with strong views about arms manufacturing. Rey also retains her title as Ultra-Mary-Sue by failing to grow, change, or develop in any way and receiving the official stamp of approval from Yoda himself, who confirms that she is indeed too cool for school. Luke is a bitter old man who establishes no meaningful relationship with any of our new characters and serves as a brief but useful decoy during the nth escape scene before literally vanishing into thin air. Bottom line: this is not a story told through the medium of film; it's a series of things that happen on film.<br/><br/>3) The Score - This really requires no explanation. If you've seen the movie, you understand.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film a 3, as there is in fact a smattering of strong visuals and good performances throughout the overly-long 152 minute run-time. That said, I would not recommend this film to anyone. Were it not for the irresistible gravity well of the Star Wars IP, this movie would surely fail on its own merits.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It may truly be the worst movie I have seen in the cinema this year, and definitely the worst Star Wars movie by a long shot. If you want to see the legacy of Star Wars, and the characters and stories that made is loved by people all over the world, spat on, this is the movie for you. The only reason I give it a one, is because some shots in the movie were great. Mark Hamill's initial reaction to this movie's script, and the review embargo by Disney truly says it all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Boy was this film bad. And I mean "Jar-Jar Binks” level bad. When the highlight of the film was the cute little owl-looking creatures, there really is nothing that’s left to say. Plot holes, cheesy-ness through the roof, underdeveloped character arcs, horrendous overly acted sludge - I mean, what exactly, if anything, did this film get right? I am absolutely shocked by the critics’ reviews. This might have been the worst Star Wars movie to date.

This movie was a disappointment.  I was excited during the opening scrawl and by the end of the movie I felt as if no answers had been provided, the plot felt rather pointless and the character arcs were non-existent or shallow.  Luke and Snoke were completely wasted.  Leia had a terrible scene and the question of Rey's lineage was pointless (unless Kylo lied to her which could be possible, but doubtful at this point).  I understand that SW wasn't made for adults, but this one had far too many cheesy moments that made me feel like I was watching Phantom Menace again.<br/><br/>I readily admit that I may have simply been expecting too much from this movie.  I hope others can find pleasure in it and I hope I can actually enjoy the next Star Wars film because I don't want to hate this trilogy.  The only reason that I am giving this a one instead of a zero is because of Laura Dern's death scene and the fact that I love Star Wars (and a few other moments sprinkled in here and there as well).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Poor editing,pacing,dialogue,effects and completely appalling story decisions that take a huge dump on beloved characters and established lore. Saw it with a group of huge SW fans and none of us liked it, did I watch a different movie than the critics? A 94% on RT, many critics saying it is the best SW movie since Empire. It is easily the worst, the prequels despite all of their flaws are more entertaining than this heap.

Visually it is magnificent and the audio is excellent as well.  The acting is good but very little time is spent developing the new characters.  We never find out why the events of The Force Awakens happened and multiple scenes are ripped off from past Star Wars films.  The action is great but I was left with more questions than answers.  Luke is completely wasted in this film and should never act this way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The young jedi leaves before completing their training due to a personal internal struggle and they go to face the villain unprepared. The villain ultimately extends their hand in partnership to the jedi who in turn rejects this. The jedi loses their lightsaber in this confrontation shortly after having a great truth revealed about their lineage.   Meanwhile…<br/><br/>A young roguelike hero, following a close engagement with the enemy, seeks brief refuge and support from a fellow roguelike on a planet seemingly unaffiliated and unaffected by the galactic conquest. The hero is eventually betrayed by the roguelike and handed over to the enemy forces. Also…<br/><br/>A great battle takes place on a planet consisting of mostly large white flat surfaces. The rebellion forces entrench themselves in defense against AT AT walkers and storm trooper forces. The rebellion forces are eventually pushed back and forced to retreat from their base.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There's nothing quite like the feeling of sitting in a dark cinema with that pause after "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..." when that glorious music starts and the title screen appears.<br/><br/>Star Wars: The Last Jedi is like getting repeatedly hit in the face with nostalgia, but if you thought the Porgs were the biggest concern well think again. Picking up almost immediately from The Force Awakens. For the most part The Last Jedi feels strongly like a combination of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. With a few twists and turns and a not so lovely section in the middle that felt like it came straight out of George Lucas's imagination. This is the 8th Star Wars movie now (no Rogue One you don't count) so they had to up the stakes and it won't let you down in that area. It's good, I liked it but I didn't love it. The Last Jedi feels like it's missing something, the wow factor. This new trilogy might have peaked at The Force Awakens, but if it helps The Last Jedi is better than all the prequels and Rogue One combined.<br/><br/>Every single actor is giving it their all and loving every minute of it. Carrie Fisher is magnificent and there is no way you would want to miss her final performance as Leia Organa. Domhnall Gleeson gave another chilling performance as General Hux. Adam Driver took his character to another level I didn't even think he had. Sure you have your general clichés and humour thrown into the script but that's to be expected. Amazingly for all the time that has passed in the life of Luke Skywalker he is the exact same as he was when we last saw him onscreen. Any apparent character development is non-existent. He's still the same whiny annoyance he was in the original Star Wars trilogy, the only thing that's changed is his age. The beginning and the end is the best thing about The Last Jedi, but I could have done without all that stuff in the middle about finding your true self with scenes reminiscent of the Never Ending Story. It kills the story dead and upset the pace set in the opening scenes. Maybe if it had lost 20 minutes and made the scenes with Luke just a little more interesting I might have loved it, or at least put it on the same level as The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>It answers the questions asked in The Force Awakens. The visual effects and the ultra creative lightsaber fights will make your inner fanboy go crazy. It's a Star Wars movie you can enjoy so what more can we expect? Nothing will ever top Empire Strikes Back so we just have to take what we can get and although The Last Jedi isn't a masterpiece it's entertaining and enjoyable. Recommended, but if you're already a Star Wars fan you don't need any recommendation, you've already seen it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But I was wrong. Despite not being a horrible movie, the last jedi is a remix of episodes IV, V and VI and an adittion of some plots with no interests in order to extend the long duration of the film (for example, Finn is a character with no importance in this new trilogy who cries out for dying and disappearing forever of star wars universe, and  Poe is a cheap copy of Han Solo). The quality of the villains are totally missed (Kylo improves in relation with the episode VII, but he still has not explode), the script is quite simple (focused on kids and young people), and only the old guard (Luke and Leia) and a good Rey, try to rescue a film that kids and people who is not fan of the saga will enjoy too much, but an important percent of the real fans of the original episodes of star wars will be disappointed after watching it.<br/>"These aren´t the droids you´re looking for", said Kenobi. And these aren´t the star wars films we´re looking for, Disney. I say.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Then throughout the movie it constantly feels forced, and interrupts any good time I may have been having by making it deliberately goofy. I won't waste any words, on the plot holes, those have been extensively covered. I left the movie theater feeling perplexed at what I just watched. No sense of satisfaction, no joy. I left feeling like it was such a waste. TFA, while repeated the originals formula, at least created new characters that we were excited to find out more about and gave us new characters to love and hate. This movie treats all the characters in the film, including our most beloved, as completely expendable with zero emotion. I look forward to someone from the internet doing a "Phantom Edit" version of the movie. There were some scenes that I really enjoyed. However, overall it makes me feel like the story is ruined and leaves me with no interest in seeing how end up. I just don't care about whats left of the characters or plot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I am left wondering if he really is a fan of this franchise. I've gone to both first showings in my local movie theater for The Force Awakens and Rogue One and never have I seen this kind of reaction before. On Thursday after I saw the Last Jedi when I walked out I overheard someone say this was the worst movie they've ever seen and one guy actually broke down outside the room. These three kids dressed as jedi and Rey were really upset about the movie. It was ridiculous how gloomy it felt when people were walking out. The Force Awakens and Rogue One did not do this to the viewers. Even if I did somehow enjoy this garbage I don't think I could've been happy after seeing all the reactions around me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In fact, this is film is actually a eulogy for the franchise. 'Star Wars' is dead, and Disney killed it. That said, they killed it in the most brilliant and spectacular way possible. I'd be lying if I said I didn't just enjoy watching the franchise die, and I feel a little bit guilty for saying that. Why?<br/><br/>It shatters every expectation anyone had for what the movie was going to be. Aside from not being a rehash of 'the Empire Strikes Back' as many people feared it would be, it does so many new and unexpected things so well, that it's hard not to be in awe. Characters you didn't think would die bite the dust, new concepts and ideas are presented beautifully to the audience, and plot threads that seemed predictable at first are suddenly usurped. It's a spectacle to behold and utterly brilliant. This is also it's biggest problem. The whole thing feels like it was trying so hard to be epic and original, that it completely lost sight of how Star Wars is built on classic story telling tropes and concepts. It feels utterly alien in a universe that is alien in and of itself. I'm not saying that 'Star Wars' has to be the same thing over and over, but that it has to cling to it's roots and provide the audience with the sense of familiarity we all have with the original. 'Star Wars' isn't about high concepts or deep philosophical implications, it was about an original story that felt like a familiar fairy tale. So when you watch this, shed a tear for what once was. We'll never feel the simplistic magic of the original ever again; we all know this, and we've known it ever since the 'Phantom Menace' came out. As that tear rolls down your cheek though, take comfort knowing that every end is a new beginning, and watch knowing that even though this movie is 'Star Wars' in name only, there is still plenty of adventure left in the universe, even if it is weird unfamiliar.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

What an absolute disappointment. "The director took risks" is a good way of saying that the director went in directions that made little to no sense. The only excitement in this movie was seeing how kylo ren's story line played out, and that was weak too. The fact that this movie currently has an 86 on metacritic makes me completely skeptical of movie reviews as a collective. There are parts in this movie that are insanely cool, but those parts are lost in a sea of weird plot turns and a weak narrative that is largely based on hyperbole. If you split the two main narratives of this movie in half, one was a complete waste of time while the other lead up to nowhere. To end this review I'm just gonna say, they made luke skywalker a complete loser in this movie and Disney is going to drive this franchise into the ground.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I either like a movie or I don't - either way I move on. NOT TODAY!!!<br/><br/>Where do I begin with this farce? Everyone is getting some. Let's begin:<br/><br/>1. Star Wars "fans" The new generation of Star Wars Prequel era sympathizers are here. "The Sequels are untouchable!" "If you don't like them you're a hater who hates change!" "Star Wars fans can never be happy! What else is new!" And other dismissive towing the line fanboy garbage.<br/><br/>IF you think this is a good action movie? Ok. But this is NOT a Star Wars movie. It doesn;t feel like a Star Wars movie or hold true to the characters that they even built up FOR THIS TRILOGY.<br/><br/>2. Characters:<br/><br/>Snoke? Guy who started the First order? Seduced Kylo AWAY FROM LUKE (he had the power to do that) and the guy who triggered the events of Ep.7 and this trilogy? Who saw the "rise and fall of the Empire" according to the canon TFA novel? Who took over a fallen Sith Empire? Who desperately wanted Luke dead and who Luke knew of?<br/><br/>He's nobody. Plot device to move plot along. Can toy with Rey and Kylo and toss them around like rag dolls but didn't see a slow moving lightsaber RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. Even after boasting how he knew Kylo in and out. DEAD.<br/><br/>JJ built him up to be a huge powerful menace. Serkis said he was more powerful than either Sidious or Vader: DEAD.<br/><br/>Who was he? Why did he do what he did? Where was he all this time knowing he said he was around? Rian Johnson doesn't care. He's done away with halfway through the film.<br/><br/><br/>Luke? He's milking **** infested 4 titted Blue Milk animals while the universe clings to dear life by his failures. He is Ok with this and just wants to die. Selfish? Thought that was a dark side trait? He says he won't train Rey because the jedi need to end only to train her to show her why they need to end and then says he's not the last jedi even though we are told by Snoke he is the last jedi. Sure.<br/><br/>Then they kill him. He dies. The original Luke. They had Mark Hamill and he commits suicide on a rock or dies of force illusion across universe something something? Shameful misuse.<br/><br/>Rey? Lineage? Speculated for years. Hyped for 1.5 movies with flash backs and call backs and mentions and she goes in a dangerous cave and who were they? NOBODY. Oh and their DEAD.<br/>Then she magically escapes Snoke mega giant ship and takes one an army of tie fighters. OK!<br/><br/>Finn? Character arc wasted. He's not apart of the new Jedi. He tries to run again. Tries to commit suicide into a Starkiller miniature and who knows if it would work at all? But you know, movie, I guess.<br/><br/>Kylo? Loved him. Great acting. But shouldn't be Supreme Leader.<br/><br/>3. Plot Holes the size of black holes.<br/><br/>The giant Dreadnought has no shields but a resistance ship does. Purple hair lady doesn't tell Poe about why they are leaving he commits an unnecessary mutiny.<br/><br/>THE RESISTANCE calls up Maz who is playing Battlefront 2 or something? And Poe knows her somehow. Should have been Finn making the call.<br/><br/>The RESISTANCE TRUSTS their future on a guy who turns out to not be the codebreaker and they trust him because movie. No idea if he could do it so they trust a prisoner. I guess it might have been a sort of The Matrix follow the white rabbit or something but go f#$k yourself movie doesn't care.<br/><br/>Asian girl says she loves Finn. Since when? Seriously? LOVE? OK!<br/><br/>I could go on. This would turn into a Mr. Plinkett Star Wars movie review. And that is the only good thing about Star Wars is that we will get a Plinkett Review.<br/><br/>Im done with Star Wars. All you excuse makers and nostalgia freaks can cirle jerk to this movie. Rian Johnson murdered 40 years of star wars. He's a fraud who made me appreciate even the Prequels. At least Lucas didn't f#$k his characters.<br/><br/>goodbye Star Wars you only exist in 3 originals and legends books. Books they made LEGENDS for this farce to exist.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The only thing remotely good about this movie was Mark Hamill's performance as Luke. Even then, there were moments that were not Luke Skywalker at all, but that is not Hamill's fault.<br/><br/>Slight SPOILERS -<br/><br/>What I watched was not Star Wars. It was some Star Wars characters in a world with misplaced comedy (if I can even call it comedy…), a bastardized idea of the Force where any Cindy Lu can instantly gain in-depth knowledge and control of it, and so many subplots I forgot about the main plot—which was… Well it was about the… Um. What was this movie about?<br/><br/>Daisy Ridley’s acting ruins a character that could have some serious depth. It is as if the ability to fake cry and look intensely in any random direction shows us who Rey really is. I think I am actually depressed that she will get other roles from these movies.<br/><br/>Adam Driver plays Kylo fairly well. It’s unfortunate they debased his character into a whinny, beefcake with daddy issues. I say beefcake because SPOILER shirtless scene SPOILER.<br/><br/>Snoke. What a waste. What an absolute waste and that is all.<br/><br/>The Force Awakens wasn’t the greatest movie ever, in my opinion, but it was the best attempt anyone could have done in bringing back a franchise. What it needed was a great sequel. Something to do some explaining, character development, and maybe some epic fight scenes. What they gave us was movie with a brand slapped on the back.<br/>I don't think I ever would have imagined wanting Lucas back at the story telling. We need Lucas. End of story. I won’t go further because it’s just too sad. It’s too sad to see something with so much potential settle on a trash compacter as their new home.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Along with it over is the need for a structure, for a theme, for a point for the heroes to exist. No one cares about giving back stories to the characters, or even names. They just exist. Star wars was about a vast universe with lore, background and character development.<br/><br/>All this is gone. No one cares why someone is a bad guy, or a good one. And you will never discover anything. Just throw in more pokemon-like creatures and silly jokes.<br/><br/>We once mocked George Lucas for lines and bad writing like "I'll try spinning" or "I hate sand".<br/><br/>After this movie, we all miss George Lucas. Yes. It is that bad. And utterly pointless.<br/><br/>Let's call it quits and keep Rogue One as the only new SW movie in an otherwise pretty much bulletproof 6-logy.

In short, great acting saved bad writing. The film was rife with forced comedy, political and religious jabs, and an unapologetic irreverence of established lore. A few lines of dialog revealed the underlying theme of the movie: Destroy the past, embrace the future. In that, Rian Johnson was successful as the film was more injurious to the legacy than any of its forerunners.<br/><br/>This film was more about Mr. Johnson hiking up his leg and urinating on the franchise to mark its new direction as his own rather than show any respect for his predecessor's work or the fan base that drives its success. No, he chose instead to tear everything down and infect a new foundation with his ideology.<br/><br/>Granted, some might say that’s a director’s job, but this isn’t an independent project. It cannot have a separate voice. As a continuing saga, it is wholly dependent upon everything that has come before it. Thinking otherwise is foolish. Acting so is even worse.<br/><br/>As further evidence of Mr. Johnson’s impertinence, the setups from previous films that demanded answers in this one were, instead, brushed off as irrelevant. They were either given a half-witted explanation or abruptly ended without one. Both are symptomatic of weak writing. This viewer left disappointed at the lack of effort.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, this is a Star Wars film, and as such, I respect that it is now canon and anxiously await the next episode, but only to cleanse my palette of this bitter pill. I just hope Disney never lets Mr. Johnson near a keyboard or the big chair again until he proves he has learned from his epic mistakes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The cast was great: Mark Hamill was at his most greatest performance as Master Luke; Rey was terrific; Kylo began to grow on the audiece; Finn's role was satisfactory; Carrie Fisher gave a calm and beautiful final performance; the action scenes were fantastic and and has given the Star Wars franchise a new sense of view; the humor was so on point; there were many unexpected surprises which gave the film a solid edge. I would say that I've enjoyed the Last Jedi a little bit more than The Force Awakens. For sure, both films are still better than the prequels.<br/><br/>DARK SIDE: OMG! TOO MANY DISSATISFACTIONS!

As far as actual storytelling goes, and filmmaking, this is not a good movie. Not only was I bored throughout large portions of this film, there was little development in the way of characters, and little to no reason to be emotionally invested in the plot, the characters, or the galaxy as a whole.<br/><br/>Where do I begin.<br/><br/>First off, I loved the Original Trilogy, I had my misgivings about the Prequels, I did not like The Force Awakens, and I adored Rogue One. In fact, I saw Rogue One four times in theaters. While Rogue One was not perfect, I was emotionally invested, and the scene of Vader in the hallway was worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>There are no such moments in The Last Jedi. There are few memorable scenes. The dialogue is weak. There are whole subplots that are hamfisted and unnecessary. Characters are introduced with little to no reason, zero complexity, only to check the boxes of diversity.<br/><br/>Luke has been ruined as a character. He has regressed. Some of the critical reviews raved about a lightsaber fight -- sorry, there is not lightsaber fight in this movie. If you think there is, you will be sorely disappointed. Walkers apparently do not make noise anymore when they walk. General Hux is a laughing stock. Can you imagine Gold Leader calling the Death Star and dropping a 'yo momma' joke on Grand Moff Tarkin? Sadly, this movie has turned our beloved Star Wars into "Marvel-in-Space." The few moments were we could have actually cared about a character's sacrifice (such as Finn), we are blocked from it, and forced to drink a contrived 'romance' instead, if you can even call anything that goes on in this film romance.<br/><br/>I heard about the 'stunning' visual shots that Rian employed. Sorry, which ones? This movie paled in comparison to the shots in Rogue One.<br/><br/>Next, the Galaxy is so small, it's been reduced to about 200 people. We have zero context for this war, and what's going on in this galaxy far, far away. It feels small, tiny, irrelevant. Stakes? What stakes?<br/><br/>All is not lost. Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren is commendable. Ren is, perhaps, the most complex character now (but it's not saying much, I'm sorry to say). Admiral Ackbar dies in a bit of dialogue. What a waste.<br/><br/>Snoke dies in an anti-climatic fashion. Another waste.<br/><br/>Rey's performance has improved. The casino scene could has been skipped. 30 minutes of waste there.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this movie was unnecessary. I believe that if you enjoyed The Force Awakens, you will probably enjoy this. If you enjoyed Rogue One, you will not like this. I left the theater feeling empty. The one scene that got me, and I mean the ONE scene, was Luke saying goodbye to Leia. I shed a tear here, but not because the movie earned it from me, but because I knew that Carrie was dead in real life, and her send off was going to be wantonly wasted in this movie that should never have been a movie.<br/><br/>I'm devastated.<br/><br/>I will never watch this again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It was almost if there was distaste for anything Luke or Skywalker and now the characters of Luke, Leia, and Han are gone to make way for the new? The aforementioned characters and Skywalker legacy caried this franchise for five decades, hundreds of books, comic runs, video and rpgs, and several cartoon series. This movie seemed to want to make all of that non-important. GoT might as well flush the Targaryen's, Starks, Lannisters, and Baratheons. I can't see Kylo, Rey, Finn, and Poe carrying on such a legacy of their own both within the movieverse and without which made offing Han, now Luke, and of course Leia's next movei all the more tragic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This one, I will give credit that they actually tried to tell a story but meandered so much and didn’t really either make sense or completely tie end the 3 different settings.  For as much as people chastised GL for his script writing both films were completely horribly written and directed.

The movie leaves you on empty. A lot of things were put together to offer fan service but in an awful way. Some plot points to move the story forward were far too convenient. The main vilain gets disposed off in a shocking but also very stupid way. It is a good pop corn film but not worthy of being a Star Wars film. It could have been a good tv film but it is not the quality of a full feature for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7873157"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I'm not entirely convinced that the public version of this movie wasn't some sort of prank, or Russian-hacked re-edit of the movie the critics saw. I find there to be no way that the critics could have watched the same movie the viewing public did and come away with the reaction they had.<br/><br/>Heading into the movie, I was excited (as I am any time I see a Star Wars movie or show, but in this case reviews were saying it was the best Star Wars movie ever). It started poorly, with the first scene feeling straight out of a sci-fi B-movie: walk toward camera, react as an amateur to something in the distance. Not promising. Between that point and the bridge being flushed out into space, all was well. Then...it started to go off the rails.<br/><br/>In a gut wrenching moment, Kylo Ren decides not to destroy his mother. He and two other tie fighters PENETRATE THE SHIELDS (emphasis added as I feel this is REALLY important) and do damage to the frigate. Kylo backs off, his emotions intervening. His wingmen do not, and they fire their torpedoes. In what seemed to be a masterful moment, Leia looks at the audience, almost as to say "you know what's happening. I know what's happening. Goodbye." She is then flushed into space with other heros, but the screen was centered on her. My stomach turned in a beautiful moment shared with the audience. She was lost standing up for the rebellion. My mind would always capture her in defiance, stoic, a hero.<br/><br/>Moments later, the force flutters around her. With no explanation, she is able to extend her hand and guide herself back to an airlock. Where others saw Mary Poppins, I saw what looked to me to be a witch riding a broom. This was horribly insulting. How can she have the wear-with-all to be basically dead and force-force herself back to life and then pull into an airlock? She couldn't have summoned the force to help prevent the entire bridge from being blown into space? I just don't understand how this was a good story decision, a good aesthetic decision, or just plain a decision. The actress DIED. The audience who loves her knows she's dead in real life. But you decided to do what doctors in real life couldn't and bring her back to life in the single cheesiest way possible? How was this a thing? How could the multitude of critics who saw this not cringe?<br/><br/>Lets move past that. The pursuit sequence is what really kills the pace and the narrative for me. It seems clear that a narrative platform was necessary to draw the length of the movie out to allow for the more epic and enjoyable aspects of this movie, which is a shame. There was no need for this, nor the explication involved.<br/><br/>I didn't count exactly how many there were, but there were at least 5 star destroyers with the main ship. They were doing nothing. The pursuit of two rebel support ships and the main frigate hinges on three things: lack of fuel on the part of the rebels, lack of speed on the part of the First Order due to the size of their ships, and the point of diminishing return on the power of the First Order weapons. Those three facts alone are fine. But the 5+ star destroyers doing nothing? They can't jump to light speed and come out in front of the rebel retreat, establish a blockade, and allow the main ship to go in for the kill? Were they running out of fuel too? The rebels were, so what was the plan to get to Crait? They had to limp along until they were JUST in range? But this wasn't shared with high-level staff members? So no one but Leia and the admiral knew the plan? If they had just SHARED that plan, we wouldn't have to sit through the agonizing sequences at Canto Bight. Which, from a narrative perspective, could have been saved by placing a code breaker on one of the rebel ships - a more plausible sub-plot, which wouldn't have squandered Finn - one of the best recent Star Wars characters - on a mission which had a zero-sum impact on the overall story. Canto-Bight itself was just a dull waste of time to extend this to the longest Star Wars movie ever, for poor, poor reasons. The arc caused Finn, Rose, BB-8, and Phasma into scenarios which felt like they were intentional but irrelevant fan services and did nothing for the story.<br/><br/>Canto-Bight and flying-space-Leia unfortunately detract from excellent action and interesting storylines of Rey, Luke, Chewie, and Snoke. If time spent on Canto-Bight removed time from Snoke's backstory or explaining how Rey was retrieved by Chewie and the Falcon, then I'll be especially angry.<br/><br/>There are additional plot holes. There are additional disappointments. But these are the best I can do in 5000 characters. I wanted to love this movie and I've been in a funk since seeing it. The Force Awakens, for all of its comparable motions toward the original trilogy, was tight, dark, added to the Star Wars universe, and left us wanting and wondering. The Last Jedi taints what was started there. I'd allow a mulligan on this movie if they could recut it into something consistent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I am probably only one of three or four people on this planet who doesn't like "Star Wars", from the first movie to this one, and never have.    But it seems the media is always praising this franchise for all it's worth, and the nerds have made it their own modern day mythological centerpiece, bordering sometimes on a religious fervor.    Here's what I do like - special effects, some of the scenes imaginative creatures, the red room where the Migraine From Hell rules the uh, whatever evil empire, and fight scenes, to a point.    Here's what I don't like:    everything else.    Am I the only mortal to recognize the lame beyond description acting and so called storyline?    This is so predictable, so cliched and unimaginative it's almost insulting.    It's like "General Hospital" with light sabers.    Not even otherwise fine actors like Tom Hardy (where was he?    I missed him), Benecio Del Toro, who out acted everybody in the brief time he was on screen, and others could save this script.    Just to show how predictable it was, I was positive there would be the most overused "hero" style line in Hollywood - "fulfill your destiny", and sure enough, Cranium Brain didn't disappoint.    Of course, my opinion will make no difference in this installment's success, and nobody will care what I think.    But it should be recorded somewhere in the annals of the history of the world when the servers in thousands of years are investigated by archaeologists that at least one Earthling from that ancient time thought this whole family of movies sucked.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

(Seriously,I warned you.)<br/>So...After the huge 'Tidal Wave' that was the fans tearing the movie apart with a massive hate on it (move over,prequels),I was really scared for the screening,but in the end was Star Wars The Last Jedi a massive letdown (as the fans 'always' say)? Wrong. A 1000 times wrong. This is one of the best movies i've seen this year,even if it's nowhere near Empire Strikes Back. The pure love that an indie director like Rian Johnson (Brick,Looper) crafts throughout was so impressive,I kept smiling for the whole runtime. Like some rare sequels (say,the recent Blade Runner 2049 or Toy Story 2),this is one of those that truly expands upon the last one,with a production design that really loves the universe and tries to put every single detail on it. Think of it like a birthday cake: You have the bread,which is the set design,a delicious cream made of Oscar-worthy Visual and Sound Effects,the taste of the bread which is the story that delivers some surprising twists and a comedic timing that I only saw in Empire,and then the candles,which are the score (this time made excellently by John Williams,unlike TFA) and the acting,with Mark Hamill delivering the example of what a Supporting Actor Oscar nominee should look and be like,Adam Driver constantly evolving through his career with a Kylo Ren that is truly written this time around,and the saddest tribute I could have ever seen in a movie by Carrie Fisher. And yeah,the Porgs sure are adorable,i'll put those as sprinkles on my cake,thanks. The only flaw that keeps it from a 10/10 is the relation (?) between Finn (played by John Boyega) and Rose (played by Kelly Marie Tran). It almost makes the experience distracting from the main story,but it's not like a huge pinpoint. It was decent to look at. And another flaw isn't specifically with the movie,but it's revolved around the internet,and that's the fans: "Overrated s**t"<br/>"It changes nothing we have had for 2 years while having the slowest space chase in cinematic history."<br/>"Too D**n long!"<br/>EVERYONE HAS TO SETTLE THE CREEPER DOWN. If you are reading this as a fan,hoew the living TNT could you get upset and mad at this?!? You did the same thing in TFA being ''A New Hope 2.0" (one of its biggest cons and pros),now you're being mad at something that tries to go a different route rather than being ''Empire Strikes Back 2.0''?!? Well,good luck on making this the "mother!" of Sci-Fi movies... Because that's how the Internet works... And 2017's horrid generation of young audience members... (i'm 15).<br/>But anyway,yes,i do recommend checking out The Last Jedi. Trust me,it'll be worth your time and the hype.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7872349"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Well, The Farce Awakens might have been just a bad remake of a New Hope with plot holes the size of Star destroyers, a lame Mary Sue of a main character, unmemorable secondary characters and no creativity or artistic vision whatsoever but at it least wasn't a snooze fest. The Last Jedi tries to remake The Empire Strikes back but only achieves in remaking that film's bad pacing and filler scenes, without any of the world building and character depth.<br/><br/>This movie seems to have been made by someone who trully hates Star Wars, its world, lore and characters. It's the only way I can explain why all these things are butchered here. Hobo Luke is probably the worst thing. I can understand them wanting to make him a fallen hero but there is a difference between making him a flawed character haunted by his failure and making him a psychopath that wants to murder his nephew in his sleep. Yoda also shows up looking like a cheap puppet(because it's all about mu practical effects) and burns down the tree that had all the knowledge and history of the Jedi Order. Apparently, MaRey Sue doen't need all that wisdom and training, she is perfect just the way she is, she even manages to overpower Luke in a brief duel, you go, Girl! Oh, yeah, and the mysterious Dark Lord Snoke is killed without being given any backstory and replaced as the main antagonist by the Emo Manchild Kylo Ren. Best movie in the series, amirighte guyz?<br/><br/>But of course, these are just my criticism as a SW fanboy. However, now that this movie has a lower fan rating than Attack of the Clones, Disney Drones will try to convince you that, even though it's not a great Star Wars movie, it's still a very good movie on its own. Nothing further from the truth: this is the worst movie I saw in the year that gave us Justice League. From abysmal dialogue, to scenes that could have easilly been cut and nothing would have been lost to characters that have no development. Finn doesn't evolve beyong his funny black man role and now he is partnered with a chubby Asian chick because Kathleen Kennedy forgot to add yellow to the Diversity Rainbow in the Farce Awakens. Poe is just as useless as before, his only role in this movie is having his priviledge checked by older women. Oh, yeah, and as per Disney tradition there is a "witty" millenial joke every 30 seconds, even in scenes that are supposed to have tension, yet the only time I laughted at this movie is when Leia started flying through space Superman style.<br/><br/>There are so many other things I could go on about, like the terrible aliens that are shoved in your face every 2 minutes to sell merchandise or the SJW pandering, but it's really not worth it. Watching these Disney Star Wars movies get worse and worse every years and enjoying the tears of fanboys that made fun of Lucas for over a decade bacame some sort of Christmas tradition. Star Wars is now the iPhone or Call of Duty or whatever souless corporate cashcow you want to name that tricks idiots into buying it only to forget about it the next months.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

These failed attempts to generate an emotional response from the audience rely mostly on nostalgia rather than the film's own merits, and ultimately feel wasted since they bring no actual, deep or meaningful modifications to the core structure of the saga.<br/><br/>A wasted opportunity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7872932"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Before I get into The Last Jedi, I would like to provide some background of where I am coming from. I am twenty-one years old and I have been a fan of Star Wars for as long as I remember. I grew up in the age of the prequels, and while I have gotten new perspective on them in time, I still have a fond attachment to the Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith (Clone Wars is a different story). But like many fans, nothing really tops the original trilogy for me. While The Force Awakens had clear reused material, I still walked out of the theater two years ago as excited about Star Wars as ever. They had introduced a new cast and set up for what I though could be a strong trilogy. They intruded the Big Baddy Snoke and teased there might finally be answers behind the old Palpatine's master questions. ----------------------------------------------------<br/>Then there was the Rogue One, a gritty and darker Star Wars film that toke me by surprise. An isolated cast of characters that did not need to rely of all the big names of the other movies that would fill in a series long question about the Death Star and the Empire. This film quickly rose to become one of my favorites, perhaps just behind Empire Strikes Back. Plus the ending scene with Vader... you know what I'm talking about. Never before had I felt legitimate fear of a Star Wars Villain. This movie gave me hope. ----------------------------------------------------<br/>Now, the Last Jedi was marketed as a darker film. "Time for the Jedi to End" This quote caught my attention. Would they finally be moving back from the singular story of the good guy Jedi and the bad guy Sith? Could this be the story where they explore the duality and balance of the force? No. I saw this film on opening night and I cannot recall a deeper sense of disappointment in a film about a series I love. ----------------------------------------------------<br/>You will see many viewers claiming that they finally told a new story and that Star Wars fans just can't handle that, or that if you liked Force Awakens and not this film then you are not a true fan. This is the biggest punch in the gut for me. I cannot see how the film told a new story as it reused old tropes from Star Wars and other films relentlessly, and failed to commit to truly daring developments at every opportunity. Instead they give you flashy, Fast and the Furious style, action scenes and shallow character developments. There must be three or four different times where a main character is saved from death at the last minute. Sure, there is no Death Star, but that does not make this story new. ----------------------------------------------------<br/>Inspiration from Empire is clear. There is a remake of the Dagobah scene, a student learning very little about the force from their master before rushing off to do something stupid against their master's will. There is a “join me and we will rule the galaxy scene”, and even a poor rendition of the Hoth battle scene on an all white salt planet this time. A Salty Hoth battle if you will. ----------------------------------------------------<br/>But, it was the forced humor that got to me the most. Every couple of minutes there had to be a forced gag. The opening scene amounts to a T-Mobile "Can you hear me now" skit with a your mom joke. Comedy was used to cover substance. I certainly laughed at a joke or two, but that is the number of jokes that felt in context during the film.<br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/>The ending digs it home and disposes of one of the series long best characters in a way I can only think the writers must have thought would be a meaningful send off.  But their death seems so out of place that I felt no emotional impact whatsoever which seems like a plot driven waste.  ----------------------------------------------------<br/>The soundtrack was well certainly well done, but is misused often. Every mention of Vader  required they play 8 notes of the Vader theme song just in case you don’t know who Vader is. Visually the film is spectacular and the team did excellent work with the sets, costumes and design.<br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/>Unfortunately those pros over overshadowed for me as the film amounted to not much more than cheap payouts. The director and writers seem to have misunderstood everything that Star Wars fans loved. Meaningful character development, slower and more impactful moments with humor when it actually fits, and plots with logical twists and turns and not just for the sake of throwing people off. To those that enjoyed this film, I am happy that you found peace and prosperity in your new empire. To the rest of us, let's hope they make the next Star Wars with actual passion and our beloved series isn’t left to die with thunderous applause.<br/>(Sorry for the poor format and dashed lines, my site kept grouping my paragraphs together when I would submit. I did my best to force organize it.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Having in mind that all SW films are aesthetically spectacular, I will only talk about the narrative itself. I truly don't get all the negative backlash on TLJ. I guess it was probably because it didn't show what these "fans" wanted to see - TLJ was able to mix that heart-warming feeling of watching a Star Wars movie with something completely new, combined with stunning and insane action scenes and epic Luke Skywalker moments. Sure, the beggining of the film is SOME confusing and there were a LOT (a LOT) of cheesy lines, Snoke wasn't what we all expected him to be, but then again, rest of the filme balances those aspects. It's 2017's best film, it's worth every penny!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Sadly it doesn't do it in a smart way. It uses jokes instead of sarcasm. It trades the push for a real world feel for pushing ridculous sight gags and plot lines that go nowhere and characters that have no pay off. This is no longer Star Wars but instead a nostalgia machine....but I hope it can be learned from and improved upon to get back on track.Rouge One is a good example of pushing in a positive direction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The audacity of this movie goes beyond words. We have reached a seminal moment in culture where a ideological movement has all but eviscerated a classic Sci-Fi franchise.<br/><br/>Problems? There are many.<br/><br/>It seems that every effort was made to destroy the base tenets the Star Wars universe was built on. The Force was silenced! Luke Skywalker, the hero of the galaxy, reappears after a 40 year hiatus- only to toss his lightsaber into the drink. He then proceeds to lock himself in a hut, only to appear to gather a drink from a four-teeted monster.<br/><br/>This is your Jedi Knight!<br/><br/>Now, on the other side of the galaxy you have Poe Dameron going up against a fleet of Star Destroyers, with a man named "Hannity" at the helm of the fleet.<br/><br/>Hannity?<br/><br/>Where did I hear that name before?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Poe's squadron is completely destroyed, with the exception of an Asian woman who heroically drops a bomb payload on one of the capital ships.<br/><br/>You go girl!<br/><br/>That really was the theme of the movie. You go girl! At every place you looked there were women characters in positions of power. Males were portrayed as cowardly and weak. Speaking of weak, the young black man, Finn, makes an appearance and tries to run away- again. He is thwarted from leaving the ship from a Starbucks barista, er, Choo, Annie, er... whatever!<br/><br/>The young, corpulent Asian lady turns out to hold a pivotal role in the movie. She will ultimately prevent Finn from committing suicide to save the Republic base.<br/><br/>Sadly, there was no heroic male to save Laura Dern, who played a startship commander, from going suicidal with a Mon Calamari cruiser.<br/><br/>Admiral Ackbar ended up fish bait as his bridge was blown up! However!<br/><br/>Princess Leia somehow discovered her Force powers at the most opportune time, as she floated through space after being ejected from the bridge after the explosion.<br/><br/>She ultimately survives!<br/><br/>And what about Rey? Who the hell is she? Apparently, just being a woman gives her enough power to master the Jedi arts. She can masterfully wield a light saber, and learn how to telepathically speak to her future revealed brother.<br/><br/>Yep, calling it... Rey really is the sister of Kylo Ren.<br/><br/>Speaking of Parker Schnabel, er Kylo Ren... He must have ran out of gold to mine on Kessel because he now is the strongest bad guy in the universe. It only took a quick mind trick to get rid of the great and powerful Snoke. Nice to know you Snoke!<br/><br/>So, you off Han Solo and now you off Snoke. What does that make you? Maybe we should ask Yoda? Yoda! Yoda!<br/><br/>Yoda appears!<br/><br/>And says... The Force means nothing! Let me blow up the ancestral tree and books of lore! Bamn!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Chewbacca is relegated to eating a Porg or a pog! Wow! What a role!<br/><br/>I do have to say the cinematography was great! That is why this gets a 1 rating.<br/>
Not to mention Luke apparently dies... The most anti-climatic ending in the history of cinema. A man who was a mighty Jedi Knight dies due to four-teeted milk overdose! That is all you need to know about this trainwreck!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It was just an Episode IV with a new twist, not presenting something really new. This time we can actually experience new ideas, on a dynamic that was not seen in a Star Wars ever before. It's a great, solid and exciting story that does not play safe, and that's the whole charm of it. If you see this movie without being strained with nostalgia, actually wanting some new perspective, chances are you will enjoy this movie deeply.<br/><br/>It's not perfect though. Some characters and plot points were undeveloped. And they did focus a lot in fan service moments that make people scream in movie theaters. I loved some, but there were just too many.<br/><br/>Another controversial thing was that some Star Wars taboos were broken. Definitive and epic answers won't be seen here, and we'll learn a thing of two of classic characters that we didn't expect at all. Some people will love this plot twists, while others will feel that the movie was reckless. I guess it will depend on how much you are open for changes and your understanding that Star Wars it's not just for you, long time fan, but also for a whole new generation.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a great movie in my opinion. See it with an open heart!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Its ironic that Disney managed to bribe most of the critics (or critics just want to be more popular with youth... poor moustache petes) but didnt managed to make a decent movie. Plot doesnt have holes, whole plot is a giant hole. Its sad to see all these characters who had such promising start in force wakens just got so wasted. Its a movie tht imbraces what is worst in our postmodernist culture, its ode to mediocricy. If John Galt would start rebelion now it should be against companies like disney. Still there were few moments of joy in this movie, but dont be decieved. Legacy of originals, even legacy of force awakens were just wipd out with single hand.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7871848"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Whilst not a perfect movie the twists and surprises for the most part work for me and make it a far more interesting star wars film than any other Disney star wars film and definitely merits a second viewing. Far more original than TFA, beautifully shot and some amazing battles (Snoke's throne room).<br/><br/>First the negatives. The film is half an hour too long and the start drags and is quite slow and choppy. The Finn and Rose story is overdrawn, Phasma is wastes, Hux appears to be a bit too incompetent, and Leia using the force didn't work for me.<br/><br/>Plus why else is nobody saying that Admiral Ackbar deserved better.<br/><br/>However the rest of the film was extremely surprising entertaining and emotional. Most complaints I've seen are about the lack of snoke backstory, the way luke was handled, Rey's parental reveal and Finn and Rose story.<br/><br/>The fact snoke was killed so early was to me one of the best moments of the film. I like many others had speculated on who he was and how he rose to power and was looking forward to answers to these questions. But I found his death surprising and showed how unpredictable and powerful Kylo really is, and whilst we still don't have any answers I'm certain we will get them eventually through a book, comic series, episode XI or maybe even a standalone film, we just need to be a little more patient. In 10 years at most this will no longer be any issue.<br/><br/>A lot of people were disappointed with how luke was shown. A lot expected him to be a great majestic hero with immense power able to destroy an entire fleet of first order star destroyers. I think that he was made to seem lazy, disconnected and uncaring for a reason. His failure to the jedi order and Ben solo has really taken its toll on him and so he has retreated into exile through depression and shame, whilst this may not have been the heroic luke people wanted to me it makes sense and makes him a better character. I thought his force powers worked really well the revelation he was just a projection made sure that the force didn't seem too overpowered and him just crushing entire fleets would have seemed a bit too dark side and not something luke would have trained himself to do during his time before Kylo. I it also showed the intelligence of luke to deceive Kylo and the first order and heart to see leia and save the resistance. The main cause of frustration with luke was that we got a luke that we didn't expect and I think with time people will realise this and perhaps begin to accept and maybe even enjoy this luke.<br/><br/>Rey's parental reveal was good for me I don't like it being only skywalkers or secret children of other powerful jedi being the people affecting the galaxy or having great strength. Plus this may not be true anyway because why would Kylo ren know anything about rey's parents. So the mystery is still there.<br/><br/>The finn and rose story is the most valid complaint as it was too long and ultimately fairly pointless but did show how the good guys aren't always right and don't always make the best decisions.<br/><br/>In conclusion I think most of the issues with this film will fade over time, maybe not completely but somewhat and I found it emotional entertaining surprising (in a good way)and my main issue was a lack of a proper send off for Admiral Ackbar, how can people hate the way luke died but not comment on Ackbar.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There was nothing to obstruct creative vision. No toy sales (at least not until RoTJ), no return on investment, no cooperate interference...<br/>And once that is accepted, I can go into these new series of films and embrace them for what they are. It isn't a terrible movie. I am a sucker for mezmarizing visuals and technical achievements in films, and so I can forgive, at least somewhat, the glaring flaws in this movie. Narratively speaking, the story is disjointed, simply because of errors in pacing and the discombobulating bounce between settings and such make things feel complicated. There is no flow. Really, the new cast of characters which JJ focused most intensely on TFA to introduce, are flat, uninteresting, lack charisma and have little shared chemistry. With the original cast gone, it's difficult to envision  a scenario which brings me back to this new group. Misplaced humor, character cameos, simply for the sake of throwing a bone at fans, and most of all, a Luke who would never (as we know him) abandon his friend and his cause to rot away in seclusion. It simply is too big a leap in uncharted waters for Luke Skywalker, and the very superficial subplot that is offered up to explain his new-found aversion to The Force and Jedi mastery is flimsy and nonsensical. I have to say this, don't care if it ruffles feathers...Rose is a terrible, useless character. Once these idiots realize that casting actors simply for the sake of diversity or advancing a progressive agenda stagnates character development, we can get back to business. Instead of something interesting, we get, "the first Asian American actress in a Star Wars movie". Never mind the fact that the potential for good, contributing characters is sacrificed simply to satisfy the goal of "first", or to "make history". It's ridiculous. Cast whomever is best for the part, ignore their heritage and gender. Political critique out of the way, I'll leave some final thoughts. Leave expectations at the doorstep. Don't think you'll see any magic, don't believe you'll be enchanted by this installment, like experienced in the OT. Enjoy it for what it's worth - visual stimulation, war, epic combat scenes, and the occasional, brief, bittersweet moment with the fallen star, outgoing cast of characters we all grew to love from the OT.<br/>**EDIT<br/>I for got to add - if you're bewildered by rave critical reviews, it's no mystery. Critic reviews are greatly influenced these days by whatever political narrative is being pursued by progressives. This film was a slam dunk in terms of progressive themes. Of course critics will sing praises, regardless of how well made the film is. The abandonment of classic archetypal elements is the pitfall of these new installments, or at least a contributing factor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They've “MILKED THE SPACE COW.” The Last Jedi (TLJ) is a deeply flawed and darkly cynical corporate product.   TLJ is not a cinematic experience, it is a product meant for purchase, consumption and disposal, plain and simple.   Like Thor:  Ragnarok, there was a reason for the Disney's review embargo.   Disney and Iger did not want word of mouth to spoil opening day ticket sales.<br/><br/>The last few months of Disney's social promotion, press junkets, "leaked" spoilers, marketing propaganda and dare I say, payola, were carefully crafted to blunt word of mouth.    Much like the 2016 Presidential election, TLJ will be a challenge to the faith of Star Wars fans much like the current administration is to lovers of democracy.<br/><br/>Yes, TLJ is that bad.<br/><br/>The Director-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named, blithely abandons the old Republic serial style of storytelling, brazenly abandons the visual style of seven previous films and two television shows, and inserts the Star Wars DNA only to plug the holes in this creaky, soggy, wooden beaver dam of a film.   How bad is it?<br/><br/>TLJ is so bad, that whenever someone complains to you about Jar Jar Binks, you'll be able to immediately counter and say ... "I'll see your Jar Jar and raise you Episode VIII."    Where to begin? There's such a rich vein of flaws that a graduate student of film could write an entire doctoral thesis titled "Poor Film Craft in 21st Century Cinema, How Profit Trumps Process."    Granted, Voldirectormort was handed a tall order to flesh out and explain what the makers of its predecessor in 2015 published interviews admittedly could not.   TLJ fails in that respect .   Don't believe the marketing hype ... there's nothing of note to spoil.    Gone is the classic Greek three act structure.   Gone is the rising action.   Gone is characters put in jeopardy.   Gone is internal logic.  Gone are many practical effects.   Gone is Star Wars, it is.   On its own merits as a film, TLJ is the worst example of 21st Century, Comic Book of the Month Club Cinema.   Granted, TLJ has many beautiful shots, but it doesn't have a single scene which has the gravitas of the epic of which it is a part.  The plot is a melange of tenuously related scenes driving to a non-existent climax and flaccid denouement.   TLJ's dialogue isn't much better.   Gone is the wooden overwrought dialogue from the prequel trilogy which is only replaced by pedestrian overly expository banter.    TLJ's greatest sin is that it's boring.   By the end of this film, you'll be begging for Senator Palpatine's astro-political machinations.   The most fascinating psychological phenomenon of human behavior is that of the blind obedience epitomized in “The Emperor's New Clothes.”   You see that in the eyes of the actors.  I saw it in the eyes of the stunned-into-silence fans leaving the theater.   December 14, 2017 was the entertainment equivalent of Election Night 2016.<br/><br/><br/>I recommend that you not pay to see this film.   You can find original Netflix, Amazon and Hulu content that's far superior.    Not that the major broadcast networks ever air films anymore, but TLJ is so bad I would say wait for it to hit ABC.   It's not even Netflix worthy. These are dark, dark times for cinema.  The success of Star Wars original trilogy was always reflected in repeat ticket sales, VHS sales, DVD sales and Blu Ray sales.   TLJ is an expensive straight to video product.   Yes, it's that bad.    You'll see it in bargain bins at a WalMart near you in the not too distant future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As someone who was there in '77, it's hard for me to say this, but it's time to let Star Wars go.    My hope for the Millennial Generation is that some independent radical movie maker comes along an makes for them their generation's King Kong, Gone with the Wind, Wizard of Oz, The Godfather, Jaws or Star Wars.   Just let it not be a sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm also wondering which film the critics have watched because it cannot be the same one I have just watched. It does not desearve the high scores. I realise that there will be new ideas, but the whole things just falls flat. The Force Awakens gave us some new interesting characters and the job of the middle film is to build on these ideas and move the story on and leave everything on a cliff hanger.<br/>The Last Jedi does none of that, it does not go onto to build the characters any further and misses the great oputunity to set up the cliff hanger for the next film. Most of the ideas from the Force Awakens are thrown away as are some of the characters. The worst Star Wars film ever? No, that will always be the Phantom Menace, but this does come perilously close.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I wondered if Disney would be bold enough to break the mold and venture to the unfamiliar and untested. The Last Jedi proved to me that this trilogy deserves to exist, and that a new Star Wars can be fresh and creative without using the past as a crutch. The sequel trilogy now has a thesis statement, characters that have been properly fleshed out, and an exciting direction that finally engrossed me in this side of the saga. It's not flawless, but Star Wars desperately needed to be creative and gutsy again, and The Last Jedi manages this with the ingenuity the series deserves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Yes, the movie has plot holes, yes it makes you suspend your disbelief too many times, I myself can even say I had some issues with it as I walked out of the theater and my nitpicks kept going on the next day. But overall, I was more than satisfied with what I got: a thrilling Star Wars movie that never has a dull moment.<br/><br/>In the group of friends I went to see this with, one of them had only seen a few Star Wars movies fully in her life, but her favorite character of the saga is Jar Jar Binks. Freaking Jar Jar! But she absolutely enjoyed The Last Jedi. That’s right: a non-fan thought the movie being mercilessly attacked by its most committed followers was great. If you ask me, I say that’s proof enough that Star Wars: The Last Jedi succeeds all it intended to accomplish.<br/><br/>First off, the bad. The amount of humor put in throughout the movie is way too excessive. The Force Awakens, pulled off some phenomenal humor but still knew when to be serious. This time around, the jokes are constant, even hurting the most touching moments with a quick snarky one-liner. It certainly succeeded in making me laugh quite a lot, but the already emotionally powerful story could have been so much greater without the Porgs.<br/><br/>With the characters themselves, their arcs are not as fully realized as they could have been. Finn’s arc could have been so effective here like how it was in The Force Awakens, but instead he’s pretty much just there to exist and move the plot along. He shares a weak romantic subplot with a new character, a young, eager member of the Resistance named Rose, who’s just there really to deliver the message in the end.<br/><br/>Then there are the other old flaws of the entire Star Wars franchise, such as expositiony dialogue, but newer flaws are unique to just this movie. One scene features a new world that looks like a steampunk Great Gatsby with a casino setting that feels very out of place for Star Wars, it’s literally another Cantina scene. So basically, I understand the hate from old fans: it’s difference in style alters what’s already established. But different is good! With everything this movie does wrong, there’s just as much, possibly more, that it does right!<br/><br/>First of all, the look to the film is gritty yet stellar. The casino looks lavish with spice while the space battles above the civil life bombards with grand explosions. The world of Ahch-To is absolutely gorgeous with its design of the strange life that lives there. It always seems to rain there, even when it isn’t, which complements the condition of Luke’s damp relationship with the force. A new planet with a crystalline design holds the base for the final battle, and it’s a visual splendor to watch as the ships glide over a vast salt bed over red dust. Beneath the surface of this planet, a space battle takes itself down under through a crimson geode. Even in the throne room of Supreme Leader Snoke, pure red overpowers the screen.<br/><br/>The much more intimate moments had so many moments when I held my breath in shock and anticipation, questioning what will happen. What helps is not just the question as to who Rey’s parents are or stuff like that, but the kinesthetic relationships with some of the more prevalent characters. While some of the character relationships needed work, others, such as the force sensitive bond between Rey and Kylo Ren, were mesmerizing to watch. You even get to see a bit more of Finn’s arc with Captain Phasma fulfilled in one awesome piece of combat! There are plenty of other lightsaber duels and battle sequences that are filled with fun moments and epic choreography.<br/><br/>I particularly like how Kylo Ren is far more complex than the typical bad guy, and you can see past his emo hair to empathize with the corrupted, scared little child he truly is. Rey’s little training sessions, as few as they are, also command your attention as Luke observes what she already knows, and how he in turn learns from her, a classic mentorship bond.<br/><br/>So guys, stop setting such unrealistically high expectations for Star Wars. All the flaws about this movie, as viable as they are, are not new to the entire Star Wars series. With all the fan theories and expanded universe that try to add ownership to the fictional world, we forgot one thing about this property we’ve now gotten so serious about: watching Star Wars is supposed to be fun! That’s what I did with my friends on Thursday night, we went to have a good time and we got it. I’m not usually one to tolerate talking during a movie, but I was sharing little verbal exchanges with my friend I was sitting next to while watching the movie, and we all cheered and laughed with the rest of the crowd. The result, we had a fun, memorable night that made my friend’s 25th birthday very special. So long story short, stop getting so worked up, have some fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Everything that TFA teased was basically zeroed out by TLJ. They went a totally different direction believing that it would feel unique and different from the rest of the movies but that attempt resulted in a really problematic outcome. It didn't even feel like a star wars movie, at least not for me. They totally ruined the character arcs and the star wars myth. I mean Luke projecting himself halfway across the galaxy just to serve the plot and then just dying from Force exhaustion was just plain stupid...Not to mention Leia surviving in the vacuum of space and then force pulling herself to safety...more like a generic sci fi than a Star Wars movie. Yes the entire movie didn't feel like its Star Wars but a generic sci fi movie with unnecessary subplots and forced humor.   I really tried to like this movie because i'm a big star wars fan but they just went too far with everything in this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I legitimately can not understand why there is such a huge dramatic rift in fan reactions other than people are just being awful trolls. People complained that Force Awakens was too much like the originals and too safe and now they’re whining that this is too different. The filmmakers can’t win with fanboys and trolls. I’m legitimately torn on whether this or Empire Strikes Back is my favorite film. This film was DENSE, even at 2.5hrs long, there was a lot in it and if anything I could have used another 90 min to really explore some things. But even at the breakneck pace it was still awe inspiring and astounding. It felt like Star Wars at its heart, but at the same time felt like bold and dramatic new direction you wouldn’t expect for the franchise. This 2 year gap between movies is going to be even harder than the gap between Force Awakens and this film.<br/><br/>Pros: Great development for all of the characters and some really shocking twists for a handful of them. Incredible visuals. Humor. Shocking returns. Porgs! Much better use of Leia for the most part. Rey’s parentage. Clean slate and completely free and open new direction for the franchise.<br/><br/>Cons: The 30 seconds of Mary Poppins. Not enough Phasma. And shockingly the film wasn’t even close to long enough at 2.5 hours, that’s just how big the film felt.<br/><br/>I can’t recommend it enough and can’t wait to see it again, all the points and stars for this!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie felt like a huge middle finger to Episodes I - VII.  All world building and character development was thrown out the window in favor of nonsensical "plot twists" since apparently the writer couldn't come up with curve balls that actually made sense within the larger context of the saga.  To me it felt as if Rian Johnson treated this film as a reboot and did as he pleased as opposed to what made sense to the series as a whole.  You don't take creative liberties with established characters in the EIGHT FILM in a series.  Surprise us but organically not in some wtf ways.  How is Rey so powerful? Who are her parents?  Who and what is Snoke? Where did he come from?  What about the Knights of Ren?  Why has Luke suddenly become a completely different character?  Nah none of this apparently matters anymore.  Finn also gets completed shafted in this film as does Captain Phasma.  At the same time they cram in even more new characters while OT characters and even characters from The Force Awakens get thrown to the sideline.  Hopefully JJ can fix this with Episode IX because although Episode VII The Force Awakens was safe it at least worked within the larger context of the saga.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not perfect, but Rian Johnson nailed it considering the material he had to work with. It's well worth buying a ticket for.<br/><br/>Spoiler Section:<br/><br/>In my review of TFA, I complained that JJ Abrams and Disney did not take any risks. It felt almost like a clone of the original movie and none of the new characters grabbed me. Rey felt very much like a Mary Sue. It suffered from being average.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson on the other hand had the courage to take risks, and he made some decisions for the plot and characters I wouldn't have done, but he also made some choices I loved. I'll start with what I didn't like. I'm not too fussed on what was done with Luke. It made sense he would be embittered after what happened, and I agree with his assertion that the Jedi need to end. The problem is his "death" (joining the force like Obi-wan did) at the end of the film. Apparently the effort of projecting his image with the force to fool Kylo Ren took all he had. I can understand him being very drained, but dying? It's not enough to break the film though, and I'm convinced he will appear again as a force ghost. We've been shown that force ghosts can use the force to interact with the real world, and not just have a talk fest.<br/><br/>Killing off Snoke without explaining his backstory bothered me, and I'm kind of hoping he survived by transferring his consciousness or something. Rey still feels like a Mary Sue, albeit not as much. At least she's had some proper training in the force now. I would have liked to have seen Chewie play a bigger role. There wasn't enough about him dealing with his grief for Han.<br/><br/>One more thing. No Chiss and no Thrawn. I wasn't expecting it, but gee it would have been awesome. Now onto the good. This movie has made the franchise mature somewhat. I really appreciate the move towards "balance" of the force being a yin and yang like balance between dark and light. The idea that balance is the light side destroying the dark never sat right with me. The casino planet act also made some social commentary, which I enjoyed. Many people feel like it was filler, but for me, it fleshes out the universe more. Seeing Yoda again as a force ghost, and that force ghosts are able to physically interact with the real world through the force was great. It's probably my favourite scene of the film. I suspect in the next film we'll see Luke interacting with Rey in much the same way.<br/><br/>Kylo Ren is the star of this movie for me. His character has developed so much from the tantrum throwing emo kid in TFA. In typical darkside style, he waited for a good opportunity and turned on his master. The way it was done was brilliant, and the fight scene afterwards was possible the best in Star Wars yet. The relationship between Rey and Kylo developed in a really interesting way, leaving me interested to see what happens next. The misdirection in the trailers and movie itself were welcome. Poe's character was fleshed out quite a lot, and I enjoyed seeing him in action. Fin still didn't grab me much, but his interaction with the new character Rose was nice. Snoke was cool while we saw him. I'm not convinced he's really dead and I really want to learn more about him.<br/><br/>As I wrote earlier, Rey is still a bit of a Mary Sue, but Rian made a good effort of improving her character. I still can't say I like her, but I at least don't dislike her anymore. Overall, Rian told a really good story, and he sets some very interesting groundwork for the next movie. Some of the decisions made haven't gone down well with a big chunk of the fandom, and I'm not 100% happy with them myself, but they don't make the film bad. People are giving low scores because they didn't like Luke dying, Rey being a nobody, and Snoke being killed off so early. These aren't good or fair reasons to give a film a low score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

While I enjoyed both TFA and R1, this film made me feel just like I felt when the graduating class of Horizon Middle School's first year decided to go to the first matinee of Return of the Jedi over Highland Hills Water World. So that's my bona fides. I could not have cared less about Snoke and Mark Hamill delivers. Your petty plot hole complaints mirror the petty plot hole complaints from every single episode in this series. They ALWAYS have plot holes. It's part of the force. It's worth seeing in the theater.

You don't need to see any trailers to spoil this movie, you just have to be an avid fan of real Star Wars, and know Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi (scene with Snoke) by heart and The Last Jedi is spoiled. Why? Beacuse it's a soft, shallow remake, reboot and mishmash of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi best scenes, but ruined with CGI, EXTREME over-the-top political correctness and weak, uncharismatic main characters, be it villains or heroes or yet undecided/unturned. Compared to this movie and Episode 7, prequel trilogy is a masterpiece (I thought I would never say that!).<br/>I will give this movie a score of 1, just because of the scene in which Luke uses a blade of grass to show Rey how "strong" and what "Force" is?!

Rey and Kylo Ren try to bring each other on their sides about a half of the film, but in the end in a moment they just turn back. Princess Leia's fake death is hilariuos. Finn and Poe are useless. Kylo Ren's and Hux's constant hysterics are annoying. The more the newest trilogy continues, the more i appreciate the new trilogy (1999-2005).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It stole so many scenes from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi that it leaves one wondering if there was more rehashed content than original. Sadly, it doesn't even improve on those original scenes, but rather simply replays them with more CGI and less actual tension or suspense.<br/><br/>I would go into further issues with plot holes, missing backstories, and "If they could do something like that, why have they never done that before?" moments, but this movie just isn't worth the time to explain them all.<br/><br/>The popcorn is strong with this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
