Some scenes, like the scene with the cruiser blowing through the First Order's central ship, were actually really well executed and creative.  As a film on its own, it definitely stands its significant ground, and show how much effort Disney has put into the franchise.<br/>However, this movie is a sequel to The Force Awakens, and is an entry into the Star Wars series as a whole. And, on that ground, it concerns me how little care was given into recreating the atmosphere and style which made Star Wars what it is. The Last Jedi, above all else, feels like a Disney movie throughout its run time, which doesn't bode well for what should be a trilogy first and foremost. The aesthetic of a dirty, worn universe is gone, replaced by a more glossy and traditional Disney part-cyberpunk world likely because it's cheaper to shoot and animate for. This is a shame, considering that was one of the things J.J. did best in the previous film. Alien characters, too, have taken a cutback, a hallmark of Star Wars films. Interactions are kept to a bare minimum, with no subtitled scenes or, really, talking aliens whatsoever. Those that are there are mainly for comic relief, something the film has inherited an overabundance of from Marvel. (Yes, Star Wars has included humor in the past. But this feels different, and its comedy has that off-beat time which screams Disney over Lucasfilm.) The music is almost unrecognizable, with few notable themes throughout and low usage of the pre-existing score. Classic cast members were limited to only seconds of screentime, and what they have is painfully underutilized. This is a worse wound with the real-life death of Carrie Fisher, which means we have none of the classic cast able to fill living roles. Luke shouldn't have died in this film, especially since it could easily have been edited around. The plot, as a whole, is weak. The Force Awakens, with its sensation of buildup to this film, is virtually irrelevant. All of the plot points set up in the previous film are ignored, a common trait with this film. Much of the established canon is disregarded as unimportant, even with what was stated in the films themselves. Much of the dialogue is poor, too, making me think this is a script problem and not a direction issue. (I would follow by saying this is not Rian Johnson's fault, but iMDb states he wrote this film as well.) The story seems more obsessed with OCs and reinventing the wheel than it does following the traditions of the franchise, and that saddens me immensely. You can tell George Lucas was not consulted, and the plot suffers as a result.<br/>All that being said, I didn't hate the film. Again, a lot of the space CG was effective, and I am thankful to say the Porgs are not nearly as prominent as the trailer makes them seem. Kylo Ren's character was much better developed in this film than it was in TFA, leading to his performance with Daisy Ridley working quite decently. But I don't feel this makes up for a narrative weak film with such a low respect for its original material.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

These are the words that come to mind after watching what might arguably rival Episodes I and II as the worst in the series. It's as if the filmmakers knew they had a couple hours to fill and not much story to tell. The movie hops from one idea to the next without much weight, and as a result nothing in the movie feels as if it matters. Also, I'm not the most well-versed in Star Wars lore, but since when did the Force become this super-power that can conveniently do anything the characters need it to? I've been really hoping to like this new trilogy, but after seeing this, I have actually resolved not to see Episode IX.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie is honestly stupid, this movie makes me feel like Rian Johnson took the biggest, steaming pile of crap on Star Wars. I've been born into Star Wars, I know what I mean when I say this movie made Phantom Menace look like Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi did nothing to progress the story, answer any questions that were made by The Force Awakens, Rian Johnson dropped the ball on this one, and Disney let it happen. It was the stupidest move to avoid the death of Leia when Carrie Fisher (God rest her soul) is not able to play the part. There was no connection between the Luke Skywalker from episode VI (when Luke is the mature hero we love and grow up to be) and this Luke Skywalker that is a bitter, old man who doesn't give a crap about anything anymore, he just wants to die. Seriously??? The man, the hero, who saved his father from the dark side, who was willing to give up his life for his father, the one who sees the goodness in everyone, episode VIII was the worse interpretation of Luke Skywalker ever, to me it doesn't even seem like an interpretation of one of the Greatest heroes, but a parody. I grew up wanting to be like the real Luke, not this crapped on garbage. I believe that when Rey gave the lightsaber to Luke and he tossed it aside, that's exactly what Rian did as JJ Abrams gave him the formula for a great Star Wars movie. The sadness and anger that took over me when my hero became one with the force, you cannot, I repeat CANNOT, put so much hype into Luke only to kill him off because he was using too much of his Force Power, seriously no, that's not the way it works. You CANNOT simply destroy the stories of the characters because 'you feel like it', that is what Rian Johnson, did with Finn, with Poe, with Leia, with Luke, with SNOKE!, with Luke's old lightsaber. You have failed Rian Johnson, you have betrayed us all. You deserve all this backlash for your poor work. I really wish people understand what the problems are with this movie because they took a franchise that was beautifully made and written, the franchise that changed pop culture, and just took a massive dump on it, forget Phantom Menace, this movie sucked more than that!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Instead there are only a bunch of boring side plots.<br/><br/>The only good things are the effects, the cinematography, and Kylo Ren's character.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

When i left the theater after watching TLJ i felt sadness because how they treated Luke Skywalker character, i can overlook the slapstick humour, the cheap death of Snoke, Rose & Finn filler mission and leia's ridiculous travel in the vacuum... What i cant overlook is Luke trying to murder his nephew un full sith mode like palpatine killed plagueis, giving up and not even caring for his sister , not going to fight one last time against kylo ren and dying in the battlefield like the hero we all knew and love, instead of that we get a ridiculous force projection that by the way is by no means a cool force power or a interesting one, its a cheap desicion made by rian johnson to make something different but in a terrible way. RJ craps all over we knew about the force ...Yes, this movie is different but at the expense of butchering more than the half of the lore of Star Wars</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

When I went to see it I was hoping for to get the questions answered from the previous film, but instead, I was left with no depth and pointless explanation. The action scenes were not that good, characters were shallow, the script was brainless and there was too much comedy aspect everywhere. It is disgraceful to release a movie like this to the fans. The fans deserve a better movie. Also, stupid Disney **** us up real good and I hope they lose a lot of money on every star wars movie release from now on because of this disaster.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It took some time, but after thinking about the film, and coming to terms with what I actually think is the best way that anyone could've taken Skywalker, and the risks taken in this film...well, after LOATHING this movie for 6 days, I like it. It's more compelling in the end than The Force Awakens.<br/>It's not touching the OT, but what can?<br/><br/>There's a lot wrong with this movie (Canto Bight, gas running out?) but what's right about this movie (Rey/Ren's dynamic, Rey's backstory being perfect, the initial battle) is amazing. While the humor worked for me, YMMV. For others hurting from what happened to Luke, I'd recommend watching the Collider roundtable where they discuss Hamill's reaction to RJ's take on Luke. It allowed me to finally enjoy and accept this film as a worthy addition to the saga.

This is so poorly written and thought out that I can't even comprehend the stupidity with this film. Rian Johnson has absolutely 0 understanding of Star Wars and how the force is suppose to work; especially when it comes to the Jedi and the Sith. I'm not sure the dude has ever read a Star Wars book in his life. This was complete trash. The dude needs to read a few books, get high as **** and then watch every movie 1-6. Maybe then he will realize how poorly thought out this movie was. Unless Kylo was intentionally hiding his true power from Snoke by means of the force and intentionally looking weak then the death of Snoke makes absolutely 0 sense. Palpatine used the force to hide the presence of the dark side in him from the Jedi until he was finally able to rise to power and reveal him self as the Lord of the Sith. Sure, he killed his master in his sleep, but only after learning everything plagueis taught him or at least was willing to teach.<br/><br/>I hope this is a similar case with Kylo or this final trilogy is doomed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke Skywalker's character was rewritten to fit a poorly contrived plot. Carrie Fisher is pushed to the side lines and under used in what should have been her final moment to shine. The humour is forced and falls flat, completely missing the mark. I came away from this film feeling insulted and angry that such an incompetent director had been allowed free reign to create his own personal version of star wars. The fans are what have made the franchise so lucrative, and this is how Disney rewards them. George Lucas should never have sold out. So so sad. I will not be going to see any more Star Wars movies. It really is time for the Jedi to end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The director jettisoned everything JJ had built up, destroyed the legacy characters, added numerous new superfluous characters, failed to resolve/truncated several key plot lines without any satisfactory resolution.  Luke, Snoke, Phasma, Rey’s parentage all wasted.  The casino and code breaker thread was a silly waste of screen time.  Leia’s Superman routine... The chase/fuel plot was contrived and just plain dumb.  This was bad storing and bad choices.  Add in a very heavy handed socio-political slant with numerous brand new strong/flawless female leads interjected into an already crowded cast while simultaneously and turning Poe into an unlikable moron and you get a movie with an agenda.  Laura Dern was very good though.  Rose was painful to watch and the forced relationship with Finn was worthy of a groan and eye-roll.   My enthusiasm for the series is gone.  Hopefully JJ will be able to salvage the trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Yoda também sofreu com a culpa pelo fracasso, e também se exilou, porém ele era um MESTRE JEDI, e na FORÇA ele viveu e aprendeu. Eu esperava o mesmo com o Luke.<br/>- A Ray entrega o sabre-de-luz para o Luke e ele o arremessa? Ridículo! Isso demonstra que o "LUKE" da "NOVA VERSÂO DISNEY" não têm valores JEDI.<br/>- O Luke se naga a ensiná-la, e não a ensina nada!<br/>- Esperávamos (Sim, pois falo por muitos amigos fãs no Brasil) que o Luke demonstrasse a Sabedoria que somente um eremita na FORÇA poderia possuir. Esperávamos que ele se assemelhasse ao Mestre Yoda, testando a Ray e logo após treinando-a nos caminhos da Força.<br/>- A morte do Luke foi péssima! Ele poderia sim ter morrido em um último esforço, porém que o seu pai, Obi Wan e Yoda estivessem ali ao seu lado, para levá-lo, para nos dar o sentimento de que o seu papel findou e fora um final glorioso, finalizando assim, a SAGA SKYWALKER para iniciar a nova história "Disney".<br/>- A Princesa Leia estava limitada. Amargurada e cinzenta. Sem qualquer participação especial.<br/>- O Snoke comparar o Kylo Ren ao Vader? Isso foi uma piada?<br/>- O Snoke morreu de uma forma ridícula em vista do poder que possuía (ou que aparentava possuir).<br/>- Repetitismo chato! Fugas e mais fugas... Visões conectadas e mais visões. - Se a Leia tinha domínio da força o suficiente para protagonizar aquela cena, porquê que ela não conseguia sequer levitar pedras?<br/>- Canhão Protótipo da Estrela da Morte? Outra piada da Disney.<br/>- Um filme longo demais para mostrar apenas: fugas, deserções, visões e o péssimo Luke da Disney.<br/>- Só não classifico como ZERO porquê se trata de STAR WARS.<br/>- O Luke deveria ter sido uma combinação de Yoda e Obi Wan. Aquele que treina a nova geração, a Ray no caso, e que responde ao chamado da Rebelião, findando a sua existência em um ato heróico, glorioso e sábio.<br/>- Sabe o que teria sido muito legal? Mostrar o Templo Jedi original como ele é, e o treinamento da Ray nos caminhos da Força dentro do Templo. O treinamento de um Jedi nunca foi mostrado, apenas partes mesquinhas.<br/>- Enfim, sigam esse conselho: REFAÇAM O FILME ANTES QUE O MUNDO PERCA OUTRO ATOR MARAVILHOSO!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

However, it is a Star Wars film which means it needs to be viewed in the context as it being a successor to previous Star Wars films. One must consider how it fits in with the greater fabric of the Star Wars Universe and how it takes the ideas, characters, and places from previous movies and creates something fresh and original while still providing that majestic and hopeful experience that we know as Star Wars.<br/><br/>In the case of this utter atrocity of cinema, the creators have utterly failed in that and I am very, very disappointed.  This movie has the unfortunate effect of being more and more insulting the more you love Star Wars and I truly do love Star Wars.  I've watched all the movies save episode 1 more times than I can count.  When the expanded universe was still a thing I used to read every single book, some many, many times.  And while I was sad when "The Force Awakens" removed all those books from canon, I was still excited to see where they would bring the series.  I was still filled with the thrill of hope and amazement when I saw Episode 7 in theaters.  It may have suffered from a lack of originality but it didn't suffer from a lack of hope.  It didn't suffer from a lack of Star Wars.<br/><br/>With the Last Jedi, all my hope and excitement is gone.  This movie is just such a slap in the face to people who really loved all of the previous Star Wars films.  The film is such a mess of plot holes, utterly pointless scenes, and blatant contradictions that I quite frankly don't even know where to begin when it comes to criticizing this film.  It simply does not suffice to talk about the problems with particular bits or scenes of the movie when the problems are so fundamental to the direction and writing of this film as a whole.  The only bit of this movie I can really praise is the marvelous score by John Williams.  The rest of it, from the characters to the places and plot points was terrible.  Characters were static caricatures of themselves and the film's treatment of its minority cast members nearly offensive in its tastelessness at certain points.<br/><br/>I went into this film with such high hopes and I walked out very disappointed indeed.  I wish I could say I still have high hopes for the future of Star Wars but this movie was incredibly effective in its effort to utterly stamp them out of my very soul.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

JJ Abrams should reboot this entirely, especially the apparent resolution of Luke Skywalker's story. Sure the film was visually well made, and the Rey and Kylo Ren characters are well done and well performed. But three smart writers brainstorming in a room for one day could have written a far more compelling story (even an edgier one, if that was the aim) that did not stamp on the very heart of Luke Skywalker as well as break sharply from the nice new base created by The Force Awakens. It's trendy to eliminate heroes ever since Game of Thrones broke ground with Ned Stark, though it's getting tiresome and here it was negligent. Smart writers can pass the torch to a new generation of characters without destroying the foundation. If you're aiming to have big exits for time-honored characters, at least pen their tales in a way that doesn't rewrite personalities that were steadily built decades ago over a brilliant story arc that far surpasses anything in this film. This franchise and its key characters (especially Luke) deserve much more. It's no surprise there's a movement to demand JJ Abrams do a re-boot. Can we just pretend this was a bad dream? With all the creative Force in film, it's disheartening to think that this is the best that could be developed for this treasured franchise. Yes it will make money and yes it was optically stunning a few times--but so was The English Patient. Just looking cool (or sounding cool, in some scenes here) is not enough. "All that glitters is not gold." The studio should have demanded more creativity and prohibited character assassination. A half dozen fan boys on Reddit wrote far better story lines than we received here. Help us JJ Abrams, you're our only hope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Some pacing issues and WTF moments but not terrible.  If it were the first "Star Wars" movie ever, I'd probably rate it a 6-7 (overall enjoyable but with some faults).  It's not though...<br/><br/>As a Star Wars movie with almost 40 year of backstory, lore, and character development...it's pretty bad.  It breaks almost everything that has been built until this point.  I feel like it was written by someone with only a passing knowledge of Star Wars or who intentionally trolled fans.<br/><br/>Actions don't fit with characters, there are some significant plot holes, Jedi training breaks with every other movie (Rey is instantly god-like but Jedi training normally takes years/decades), notion of the force and balance goes against everything pushed in the prequels, timeline doesn't fit well with the immediate aftermath of the previous film other than Rey/Luke, the end of the space chase makes you wonder why this isn't done all the time to take out capital ships/death stars and makes all the previous military tactics look stupid, etc.  The Force Awakens set up a lot of mysteries and this movie basically said none of them matter and was sort of dismissive of them in my opinion (e.g., Rey's parents, Snoke, Knights of Ren, what's Luke been doing). Also as a practical matter, Princess Leia is a character that probably should have gone out in any number of points in the story but she's the only one who survives.  There are a lot of epic moments she could have died heroically.   Given the realities of the situation, this doesn't make much sense.<br/><br/>The Rey/Kylo interaction is pretty well done.  That would be the highlight of the movie.  Most of the other characters are weak or just not well developed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Beautiful to look at, but did not feel like a star wars movie. Don’t watch it! wait for it on your favorite streaming source. It’s a movie that striped away all the world building of previous Star Wars movies, so what was the point of naming this movie Star Wars. Might as well made a completely different thing. They forgot that people wanted to see a Star wars movie, not whatever this was. How is it that their letting Disney Get away with this destruction of modern mythology, it’s a disaster for any Star Wars fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The technical aspects of the film were competent - nice cinematography, lighting, sound and effects.  That being said, this series used to be about wonder and hope.  Now it's been saturated in nihilism and post-modernist box-checking.  So, so sad.  I don't know why they treated so many honorable characters with such disgrace.  I don't know why the villains were completely undermined as threats, or removed entirely. The pacing was nightmarish.  Entire plot threads went nowhere.  And there were far too many cringe-inducing moments.  Carrie Fisher flying through the vacuum of SPACE like Mary Poppins was as embarrassing as Zach Quinto's Spock yelling "Kaaaaaaaahn!!" in Star Trek Into Darkness.  My ears started throbbing from the shame.<br/><br/>Rian and Kathleen Kennedy evidently wanted to 'deconstruct' Star Wars, and they have succeeded.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Watching this movie was like having someone take a **** in my heart. They made Luke a coward and gave him no redemption. Dropped plot lines and threw away several characters. Where the hell are the Knights of Ren!? What about the other students of Luke that left with Kylo. Neither Rey nor Kylo received any training! The entire movie occurs over the coarse of like twenty-four hours which makes character development almost non existent! I Spent the whole movie waiting for that great moment that never came(excluding the throne room fight). Did anyone else notice that there is not a lightsaber battle in this entire movie? No two lightsabers come into contact with one another! Where the hell is Luke's green lightsaber? I enjoyed the force awakens to spite its many flaws. I never want to see this movie again and I no longer care about episode nine. I never thought I would say these words. Ryan Johnson should not be making his own trilogy if this is what he thinks star wars should be. I also cannot believe all the critical denial that is happening around this movie because critics are afraid to offend the creators and not get invited to the next flashy premier. The only thing to look forward to about this is the thirty minute honest trailer video you can make ripping this movie apart... Pathetic... 4/10 and that's being generous!﻿</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As a simple movie goer, I actually enjoyed The Force Awakens.  I also very much disliked The Last Jedi.  Forced jokes that seem out of place, stupid focus on cute animals, unexplained segments or motives, bad editing, pointless and bloated scenes; it's all there to make a bad movie.  The real takeaway here is that we cannot trust critic reviews anymore, as I have not seen such a false narrative and huge discrepancy in critic and audience opinion.  Truth be told, Star Wars is at a point that it is too big to not make money.  Despite the sour taste from TLJ, I will see Episode 9, since JJ will be directing.  However, I will not ever pay to watch another movie from Rian Johnson; of that you can be sure.  A complete mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The acting was pretty good, it didn't look all filmed on set as location filming is the best.  The story was a bit hectic with a lot of sub plots but overall really good.  I did get annoyed with all the emotional bits in the film and some of the 'cliche lets make it funny' statements but still not too bad.   People have to remember this is Disney.  SW has moved on from the original 5 movies and it won't ever be the same.  It will be different.  The original movies were awesome.  The new ones are good too but are not the same.  I look forward to more JJ Abrams directing in the future though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7855626"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">***Spoilers***<br/><br/>In short this movie, albeit directed by Rian Johnson, was another Jar Jar Abrams style unoriginal hack job copy paste from its predecessors; jam packed with special effects, prospective toy animals and story ideas of people who I presume, think that they are clever and/or special, but to their own detriment are not.<br/><br/>What Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy & Co. did in the Last Jedi is berserk tabula rasa butchery of not only the original trilogy but their own work TFA as well, in terms of consistency and story.<br/>Sure they have to sell new books and create newer cooler characters, and when they can’t they just make the old ones uncool to make the new ones look cool, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>Let’s go deeper.<br/>First of all, as far as Star Wars goes, I like the original trilogy a lot and respect it, I really disliked the Force Awakens because of its mock-Emperor and Darth Vader wanna be villains, its Mary Sue protagonist and the script which was copy pasted from “A New Hope”. But if I was to develop a sequel to TFA I would have to respect it even if I do not like it and keep it consistent.<br/><br/>But this film though, I hate it. Yep very strong words I know but unlike the film my feelings are sincere. I feel like Disney thinks that they can get away with any chance they take with the franchise because fans will flock to the theaters no matter what and throw away their money.<br/><br/>I did not like the “Lost” style building up of intrigue and mystery Jar Jar tried to pull off regarding Snoke and Rey’s origins and reasons for Luke’s reclusion in the Force Awakens, and it is evident in this movie that they did not think it through in TFA to have any developed story or ideas about them then. Abrams, Kasdan & Arndt were just winging it. And evidently when Kathleen Kennedy and Co. & Rian Johnson decided they cannot wing it in this movie, heck they just kill the people / ideas off without explanation. For instance:<br/><br/>-	Quickly they make Ren smash his mask. Yay no longer a Vader copy, he’s a real boy now.<br/><br/>-	Again quickly, snoke is killed by Whino Ren, while bragging how supreme he is (and we still did not learn who the bleep this guy was in the first place).<br/><br/>-	Lastly and in 10 seconds we learn that Rey’s childhood is a byproduct of bad parentage by insignificant no name junk collectors.<br/><br/>But the worst for me is the guy we love for being able to overcome the dark side and refused to kill his fallen father which in turn led to the Emperor’s undoing, Luke Skywalker, according to this movie freaked out upon sensing the dark side in Ben Solo and tried to kill him in his sleep, just for a moment. The guy who stood for optimism and was literally “the New Hope” who redeemed the unredeemable bad guy Vader, reduced to a hermit that turned his back on his loved ones, and killed off Obi Wan style, with the most ridiculous new force power of projecting interstellar holograms. Dude please.<br/><br/>Another major issue I have with this movie is that Disney, Rian Johnson or whomever is ridiculously desperate to be perceived as politically correct, diverse and inclusive; but in the end they come out as insincere since they just shove down an unnecessary parallel and nonsensical story arc of Finn and Rose with a little social commentary on capitalism, which is rich coming from Disney. As you know Disney has a rich history of depicting minorities (!).<br/><br/>Suffice it to say I will not be paying Disney for anything from now on. I probably won’t watch a Rian Johnson movie either.<br/><br/>Anyhow if you’re still reading lest make a soft exit by listing minor but nevertheless still very annoying stuff about the film:<br/>-	If you really wanted a Lando type character, here’s an idea why didn’t you just put Lando in the movie. Mr. Williams is alive and well last I checked.<br/><br/>-	You call that jedi training?<br/><br/>-	Luke milking an alien and drinking it caveman style?<br/><br/>-	I didn’t see a point in the character Vice Admiral Holdo.<br/><br/>-	I still don’t see the point of the character Maz Kanata.<br/><br/>-	Force skyping of Whino Ren and Rey, I’m no millennial nope, not for me.<br/><br/>-	Forced Marvel style humor every 2 minutes, I don’t even like it in Marvel movies either.<br/><br/>-	1 ewok type cg animal to be sold as toys is unbearable, 3 is just repugnant.<br/><br/>-	Damned Disney killed of Admiral Akbar.<br/>And on and on and on…</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The male characters (Luke, Kylo, Poe, Finn) are flawed, conflicted and interesting. They grow and change. But the female characters (Leia, Rey, Rose, Admiral Holdo) are flat, morally "pure," and have all the answers from start to finish. While their plans are occasionally thwarted (always by men), the women never truly fail on a personal level, so I found them impossible to relate to. As a woman, I want realistic female characters who are challenged, tempted, mistaken, devastated - and grow as a result. What message does this send to kids? It's okay for boys to make mistakes and learn from failure - but only perfect girls are worthy of portrayal? Women are only there to redirect men, clean up their messes, and make up for men's failings?

Imagine the longest, slowest most boring car chase scene youv watched, and extend it to 2 and a half hours of movie and youl have some idea of what Episode 8 has in store.<br/><br/>Overall a marginal improvement in some respects on episode 7, but thats not saying very much really.<br/><br/>Disapointing!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But the main problem is Rian Johnson doesn't seem to realise he is making the 2nd movie in a trilogy, or that he is making a Star Wars film.<br/><br/>None of the character arcs from TFA were dealt with in a meaningful way. Rey's background: there is none. But she is very competent with the force (bested Kylo in TFA having just picked up a lightsaber). Without training. granted she might be another Anakin type figure who comes from no where. But even the chosen one needed extensive training. Snoke: TFA looked to be setting up a good vs evil battle between Snoke/Kylo and Luke/Rey. The premise of TFA is the search for Luke whom Snoke is genuinely fearful of. Sounds like a classic Star Wars story arc to build the new trilogy on. Nope. Snoke is dispatched with no new information about him.<br/><br/>Luke: this is not the same Luke. Granted he may have changed over the years. But to believe that the guy who put it all on the line to go against Vader & Palpatine, because he believed there was some good in Anakin, would even consider killing his nephew is nonsense.<br/><br/>I could go on. The buffoon Hux, flying Leia, the kiss, animal convservation, the rebellion reduced to standing room on the Millenium falson, blue milk etc.   It seems like Disney is destroying all remnants of Lucas's Star Wars to build their own version. They should just be careful they don't destroy the fanbase in the process.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Too many people had made up their own mind about what they wanted to see and failed to go in with an open mind (or much of a mind at all).

First, White Men are not good people.  They are definitely not heroes, and humiliated and erased.  So, Han becomes a failed father that ran away from responsibility, and was so awful he was killed by his own son.  Luke is a miserable failed Jedi master that runs to a hiding place to die.  Too afraid to join the battle himself, he dies sending a projection instead.<br/><br/>Second, any new White Men characters must be evil, weak, and stupid.  So, the new generation White Men are on the dark side, but they are not scary.  General Hux, the whitest of White Men, is the joke of the new Star Wars.  He's a buffoon that is easily tricked, and made fun of, and snivels and grovels to those in power.  Kylo Ren is supposed to be dangerous; tall, physically strong, and strong with the force, he also has years and years of training.  However, a skinny homeless girl with no training at all easily defeats him, and has to save him in this film.  His primary character trait is temper tantrums when his White Privilege doesn't work out for him. Finally, true heroes in our Leftist Star Wars are a diverse group of people devoid of White Men and led by the new saviors of the galaxy, crazy powerful and wise White Women.  Leading this group is the untrained and skinny (yet beautiful) Rey.   She is all things good to the left; no family, homeless, and poor (yet beautiful).  She can easily defeat the greatest killers in the galaxy... just cause.   She is surrounded by her diverse group of comrades.  A wise older and powerful White Woman mentor in Leia (dare we say Kathleen Kennedy).  A daring fighter in Hispanic fighter pilot Poe Dameron who is taught to temper his fight by wise White Women superiors.  A freed black slave in Finn, who learns to stand for something because of his love of a White Woman.  And now, an Asian woman has been added to bring balance (and someone to fix their electronics cause... you know... she's probably real good a math and stuff).  The reason the movie is either loved or hated depends on if you're far left SJW or not.  In the echo chamber of Hollywood, I'm sure they don't understand why everyone doesn't love this film.  However, I went with two millennial women, and they didn't like it either.  Go figure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7957763"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Stars Wars as a franchise has hit the same problem all episodic franchises (Star Trek, The Walking Dead, the WWE) eventually hit, the story has been told so often by so many diferent people, writers run in to walls trying to keep it fresh. As such, rather than work on a thoughtful retelling (which will label them as copycats) or working within the mythology to bring about logical change, they instead settle on the swerve. While a swerve can be done to great effect and still work with in narrative (The Original Planet of the Apes, The Sixth Sense) all too often it is used to hide a poor plot or lack of a real direction in a story. I would argue that is what Rian Johnson did in the Last Jedi.    *Spoilers*<br/>Having Luke become a bitter and despondent character was a bold move, and Hamill, to his credit, did an excellent job with the portrayal.  However, it was a change that did little to help the story and was promptly forgotten about when he suddenly changed his mind in a swerve that seemed only there to allow the epic battle to take place.   The betrayal of Snoke by Ren was a swerve that mirrored the betrayal of Return of Jedi, and while making Kylo a better character did so at the expense of The Force Awakens. (To be fair, I didn't care for the Force Awakens, so seeing that movie cheapened wasn't a great loss) It hurts the overall narrative of all the stories in a franchise when such things happen. If you doubt it, try watching the Godfather III.    The swerve to make the entire side quest to the Casino meaningless was, quite frankly, baffling. It seemed as if Rian Johnson literally had no idea what to do with the characters and the screen time put into it could have been spent elsewhere to much greater effect.    Putting aside the short (albeit cringe-worthy) shot of Leia's survival in space. The swerve of her surviving seemed to cheapen the moment. Epecially when you consider the only Leia we can get from this point is some CGI painting.    Needless to say, by the time Luke found his way to the the resistance, it was painfully evident that some swerve was coming. And Rian Johnson all but used the most painful, laziest, most overused swerve of them all....it was just a dream. I know, technically it was a force projection, but it all amounted to lucid dream. Luke wasn't there, it was stalling tactic, and he was ok. Except he wasn't. Throwing yet another swerve in, Luke dies, becuase... well..no reason. Just kill the past as the movie says (except for Leia).    I think that proffesional critics gave the film good reviews because anytime a movie can suprise them, it is a welcome change. What they seemed to forget is a story needs more than a plot twist to be good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They made Luke skywalker act like a frightened child and so out of character from the original Star wars movies. Luke went from being a heroic masterful jedi to a character who hates himself and those around him. It's never explained as to why the jedi must end when Luke says it. How the hell is leia alive after floating and freezing in space from being blasted out of the mothership? Yea there's mentions of her having some sort of abilities with the Force in previous movies but this movie doesn't care to explain it. Snoke was hyped up to become equivalent of Palpatin but kylo kills him in a flick of a finger. Nothing else is brought up of him. No one knows where he comes from or how strong he really is. Will he be brought back? Who knows and at this point who cares. For the love of god if you're gonna kill Luke one of the strongest Jedi to ever live and with the original actor still alive bless him to play the whole please make an EPIC **** SCENE instead he's too distressed from using the force to astral project. He died from intense meditation. This Star wars movie might have potentially killed the franchise as a whole we'll see in the coming years but personally I couldn't care less for Episode 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But sadly it is.<br/>I can`t get my head around the fact that some idiot thought it would be a good idea to go a new, exiting direction MIDWAY THROUGH A TRILOGY. **** hell, if they wanted to have a fresh approve why not set it like 200 years in the future? Why did they have to make Luke a grumpy, uncaring, alientit grabbing LOSER. HOW on earth do the defend Mary Sue beating Luke with virtually no training at all. Like in the first the people said no Mary Sue isn`t a Mary Sue you know. Kylo just had a bad day, you know. Happens to everybody. But suddenly Mary Sue is within 2 days of training a master in light saber combat.<br/>And don`t get me startet on the endless Plot Holes, the constant Deus ex machina and plot conveniences just to further a badly written story, which **** UP the storyline for the previous and following movies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson pulled off an amazing feat: create a film that feels quintessentially Star Wars while also introducing fresh ideas and pushing the story (and the whole universe) in an exciting new direction for old and new fans alike. The highs in this movie are as exhilarating and powerful as many of the best moments in the original trilogy, with a few scenes and images that are more beautiful and breathtaking than anything in the Star Wars canon. There are at least 3 scenes that made me gasp, and a half dozen images/scenes that are permanently embedded in my movie fan memory bank. It's also funny, balances dark/heavy elements with light/fun moments, does a great job of establishing new geographies and critters in a seamless way and, best of all, it's unpredictable. This is not going to go the way you think.<br/><br/>Ignore the haters. There is a small percentage of entitled, nutball fans who are trashing this film because it doesn't bow to the tyrannical, whiny 11-year boy inside them. Of course, the movie isn't perfect, and there are a few things here and there that I had considerations about, but these are nothing compared to the power and impact of what this film does well, and the huge themes that are at its foundation. To me, The Last Jedi immediately ranks no less than 4th overall behind 1) Empire Strikes Back, 2) A New Hope, and 3) Return Of The Jedi. And after I view it a few more times, it might be tied for third or possibly take over 3rd place completely. Ignore that tiny fraction of loudmouthed fanboi haters, go in with an open mind, and have a blast. I'm already looking forward to Episode IX, and I can't wait to see what Rian Johnson does with the 3 brand new Stars Wars movies (outside the Skywalker saga) that Lucasfilm has asked him to create. Exciting time to be a Star Wars fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Unfortunately after seeing The Last Jedi I have nowhere near as much enthusiam for seeing the next film. If I could describe The Last Jedi in one word it would be "Dissapointing". I feel like this film could of been so much more but ultimately fell flat in meeting my expectations. While there were some fun and visually appealing scenes throughout the movie they didn't make up for rest of the films weaknesses. I guess I could say this film lacked the spirit and fun the other films had ( Yes even the prequels ). It almost didn't feel like a Star Wars film at times but something else entirely different. It seems like the writers for this film couldn't decide what they wanted this film to be and after running out of time put out this jumbled mess. Ramblings aside, I can only hope the next film is able to redeem the franchise and if not I won't be tuning in for anymore Star Wars films.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie is a bit of a mess with far too many implausible moments (even for a Star Wars movie) that it ruins the strong parts. A certain scene with Leia especially. Snoke is way under developed and is a 1 dimensional bad guy. Kylo Ren’s role is expanded and is very good and Rey is very likable. The biggest issue I have is that the Force has turned into Deus Ex Machina and all sorts of new “powers” are invented in this film that are just far too convenient. The movie is good, not great. The Porgs are adorable and there is some good humor around them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The time to change style and reboot story is NOT the second film in a trilogy (and the 8th in a saga). Characters don't go against their core values, even when they've been through trauma, they still stay true to who they are. These characters didn't. This was terrible, lazy writing, and it makes me sad beyond words to see this parody style for something so beloved to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The media is trying to spin this as just a few fans and the backlash is mostly political hacks bombing the review websites. The reality is, this is one of the only ways average fans can voice their opinions. Countless articles are being written daily that pop up if you Google Star wars that basically say "If you don't like the movie it's because you don't like diversity ect"...Nonsense.  Almost everyone wanted this movie to be great! But it's painfully obvious for not for the same reasons.  Fans wanted to see a movie that them built on the plotlines from the Force Awakens and see Luke Freaking Skywalker.  The filmmakers wanted this movie to be great because of the "groundbreaking message of diversity it was going to send". And it's painfully obvious that more effort was put into pushing this political narrative than building a compelling story that gives us reason to care about anything. The twists and turns will surprise you but not because they are brilliant or earth shattering, but because they simply make no sense or were done for cheap shock value. There is no chemistry between characters because well... they are never together to even see if there is any. I feel bad for these young actors because it's not their fault.  This movie smugly disrespects everything done before it and that is just not cool.  Bob Iger is a smart guy, I'm sure he is behind the backlash against the backlash we are seeing.  He knows they need to right this ship ASAP because their next movie up to bat features a millennial playing Han Solo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7956864"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I do enjoy a great standalone action flick from time to time in which a new foundation is established and from which new concepts are spring boarded. However, Star Wars is not a new concept, its root system or foundation is well established. To remove the foundation from something by changing many of its fundamental characteristics and load bearing walls, one will quickly find a new construction. In cases in which load bearing walls, key characteristics of the franchise such as but not limited to Luke Skywalker, are to be adjusted they must must be treated with respect as they are removed to ensure that the structure does not implode. In that same vein, they must be replaced with a load bearing wall that is equally robust if not more robust in the process if one does not intend for the structure to fail at the point of alteration. It is my fear that the load bearing walls that are being removed (Luke, Han Solo, etc.) are not being replaced with much more than sticks and drywall (shallow characters & plot) and as a result the structure, in time, will inevitably fail. I can appreciate the dynamic between Kylo and Rey. However, I feel their innate abilities, in particular Rey AKA Mary Sue, to have such command over the nature of the force despite a lack of training or(struggle) seems to gut some of the epic appeal of Star Wars. Such a counter intuitive deviation from the trajectory within the physical tapestry of the Star Wars Universe seems to rattle the foundation of what constitutes the realm known as "Star Wars." To slap the name of Star Wars onto that which is only a mere reflection of what was previously known as Star Wars supplants the series' uniqueness with ambiguity and shallow attempts at balancing character introductions without first fleshing them out. Many missed opportunities to set this adventure upon new heights followed from the method in which the movie was approached. Instead of remodeling a building and adding another story to its current foundation, the foundation was demolished, and an entirely new building was constructed in which only the outside appearance retains some semblance to the buildings previous greatness. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with trying something innovative with this series, however in doing such, it is necessary to first establish plot shifts that evolve out of a catalyst that is birthed within a plot that is consistent with and logically follows from the foundation. That is to say, plot innovation does not have to come with disregard to the past, it only need to logically follow, or be backed with a sufficient reason or cause, as to why the story line is shifting the way it is. To simply take and input characters without depth, to input force abilities without reason or explanation, and to construct every villain with the structural integrity of a scarecrow and the emotional maturity of a child so that every "good" character always wins, is just disappointing. Ultimately, without a robust reason for changes in a set system while simply interjecting them with a disregard for consistency, removes the core appeal replacing it with something that is seemingly a hollow shell claiming to be Star Wars whilst being something altogether different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Bear with me as I try to quantify my thoughts and prioritize what I deem most important.<br/><br/>To start small, there are plotholes abundant. From the 1.5 hour long pointless space chase to the casino planet subplot, it's all pointless. Vice Admiral Holdo withholds information from Poe simply for dramatic effect and General Hux refuses to send TIE Fighters to intercept Ackbar's capital ship because dramatic effect. The casino planet exists to interweave a theme of animal rights and the entire subplot does nothing, absolutely nothing, to the main plot. It's literally pointless. Then, after about 90 minutes of time wasted, we reach the climax of the film which lasts about 20 minutes and there is no actual battle.<br/><br/>Then there's the lore breakers. For example, we see the Resistance (which I'm still not sure what they're "resisting") is reduced to a handful of starpilots and commanding officers. Why? This is a big galaxy, right? There was a Rebellion but 30 year prior. Where is everyone? That Rebellion was massive; so massive they won. The lore established by the Disney canon recognizes that billions, even trillions of Imperial citizens rose up to topple the Imperial Remnant and the First Order is all that remains. If anything, the First Order should be dwindling at this point. So why is the Resistance so flipping small? The Rebellion had millions of cells, as made clear in the TV series Rebels. It seems more likely all of this was manufactured for dramatic effect.<br/><br/>I am ok with Star Wars going in a bold new direction. That's fine. That's encouraged. I do not want to watch the same trilogy twice. Give me something new. However, and this is a big point, don't undo the previous plot. This seems petty, I know, but then what's the point, story-wise, of the original trilogy? Everything ends up backfiring and failing. In destroying the world created from the original trilogy, you honestly make the original trilogy a waste of time. We have to have a coherent plot from point A to point B: Phantom Menace to Episode IX. This is (hopefully) not a whiny critique from a fanboy, but an honest one from the perspective of all nine episodes. We've now created a world where 1-6 are somewhat less important of a story. If you want to have a good series of movies, then each of the films play off of one another to create one large plotline that tells one big story: the Skywalker Saga, as Lucas put it back in the day. This seems to throw that out the window. 7-9 shouldn't be a new story but a continuation of the bigger plot from 1-6; otherwise make them anthology films. These are no longer episodes in a bigger story, but three films completely separate from the previous 6. I think they did for marketing purposes rather than to maximize story potential.<br/><br/>Then there's Luke. He's received much criticism from the fanbase for being an inaccurate portrayal, even Mark Hamill has made it clear this is not who Luke Skywalker is, however, I'll throw that out the window. We'll disregard that the man who redeemed Darth Vader was about to kill his own sister's son because he was tempted by the dark. We'll manufacture a valid excuse and move on. However, I cannot forgive the fact that he nearly gets his ass beat by Rey, who apparently is the master of the Force despite having no training and they simply write that off because Yoda said "nah, she's an expert already. No training needed. Don't question it." Luke could have been utilized so well, but instead all we get is a mindless, pathetic, whiny old man who doesn't do much of anything and dies in the end for no reason except for, you guessed it, dramatic effect. (Remember Ackbar died so they could use Holdo to sell more toys?) Also what the hell did Chewbacca do?<br/><br/>All in all, this film, while visually stunning, acted perfectly, and has some amazing moments, like Holdo's sacrifice (which could've been Ackbar, but oh well), fails to utilize the potential it had to tie itself in with the first six films and instead chooses to line the characters at the chopping block and throw the entire plot out the window. This along with the long space chase, lack of adventure, and pointless characters seems to be nothing more than a marketing ploy that sacrifices plot for drama. That being said, the actors do a spectacular job and, for the average moviegoer, it's impossible for me to give it a poor score because it's a stunning film in its own right, but for the Star Wars fan, or for anyone who cares about the larger plot of movie serieses, this is an utter failure. However, you will be entertained from the beginning to end, guaranteed.<br/><br/>1.	Production: 21/30<br/>a.	Acting: 9<br/>b.	Crew: 9<br/>c.	Direction: 3<br/><br/>2.	Story: 8/30<br/>a.	Plot: 1<br/>b.

Lame. This film ruined Rey, making her some awkward, pointless character looking in on a family dispute she has no stake in. Rey was flat and was just used to give Kylo an arc, because Rian Johnson was in love with him. Finn was giving nothing to do, as well. All the mystery created by Abrams in TFA--gone. All the wonderful new characters introduced in TFA--disrespected. Yes, there was emotion between Kylo, Luke, and Leia, but Luke is dead and Fisher is sadly gone. No one cares about Rey vs. Kylo, now that Rey is a nothing character. This is not a legitimate Star Wars movie.  It is an ANTI-Star Wars movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Most fans of it don't understand it, even more so today in the modern ultra-rational age where everything must be explained or it's a plot hole. Believe it or not I'm not an especially faith driven person either, I can be pretty cynical at times, but even *I* get what these movies were about. What's sad is this movie hits Star Wars' themes even harder than anything before it, so it's kind of ironic that its one of the most hated of the series.<br/><br/>This hate is coming off of the awareness that Disney is milking Star Wars (which I don't deny), the old fans not getting the payoff they've been waiting for for decades, retcons of the extended universe, and the Battlefront II controversy. To be clear, Disney IS milking Star Wars, but it doesn't keep a movie from being good, neither does EA endorsing gambling for children. They make it clear throughout the entire movie that they're trying to break away from the past, trying to remake the Star Wars universe into something new, and you can feel that intention from start to end. As for the extended universe? It's just an impossible patchwork of philosophies, ideas and stories that couldn't in any way work together cohesively, let alone be kept track of. Imagine what kind of creative nightmare a movie crew would have if they had to keep track of every little fact from every comic, tv series, or book. It's a disaster waiting to happen, so they decided to create something new.<br/><br/>I'm going to keep this short and sweet. If you've always loved Star Wars for it's deeply felt emotions and it's philosophy and musings on faith, go watch it. If you're a jaded, uninspired and unflinching skeptic towards anything that can be construed as 'illogical' or a plot hole, then stay home. The movie has incredible action scenes, some great laughs and some lines that make you think, and it doesn't shy away from displaying miracles or commentate on war from multiple sides. It even gets a little psychological thrillery at some point weirdly enough. I think the reason it's being hated so much is because they got too ambitious, and in the end, I think people are too cynical to accept a hopeful movie about letting go of the past and reinventing themselves, or learning the value of failure. Beautiful isn't it? How this movie sparked the very dark and light struggle this series has been about for so long. Anyways I'm giving it a 9 because this movie didn't change my life, pce.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are no heroes here, or well developed villains, no cool light saber fights or amazing star battles. Even in in terms of being a regular sci-fi film there are so many questions. There are so many distracting and head scratching moments in this film - I cant believe these ideas got past storybording given the budget of this film. The director of this film shows no regard for the past of SW and no care for its future. Avoid this film if you want to keep thinking of Luke as hero rather than a coward, and Leia as a brave leader rather than a bystander. Sadly, Porgs are probably the best thing about the film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And the positive reviews must be from bots<br/>This movie was terrible. It had cool visuals but that's all. The worst part was Luke's character, he was not a hero or evil, either of those would have been better. He was nothing, the legend of Luke Skywalker was apocryphal, he created Kylo then refused to help fix the problems he created. The man that saw good in Vader would think of killing a teenager, impossible. Even at the end he did nothing. They dishonored the hero we grew up loving. Beyond ruining Luke, many gaping plot holes. Fin's role was pointless and caused hundreds of rebels to die. Snoke and Phasma were weak and went down like Jawas. Kylo's turn to the dark side was based on a misunderstanding. Flying Leia was moronic. Why not tell Poe the plan and save hundreds of lives? Why didn't a star destroyer cut off the rebels ship? No lightsaber duels!!!!! BB-8 can't be the solution to every problem(In the AT-ST, get's the ship, stops the prison guards...). Why didn't the laws of physics apply to Rose's ship. Fin is heading straight at full speed, she turns and comes at him from the side, and dooms everyone and stops him for actually helping the rebellion. If Yoda can affect the physical world with lightning, why isn't he helping the rebels?<br/>Rey going down the dark side pit, we learned nothing, it was pointless.<br/>That's all I can remember at the moment.<br/>Rey moving those rocks was cool(even though we never see her move anything prior to that, not sure when she developed that ability)<br/><br/>Only casual Star Wars fans and children could like this movie. If you are a serious Star Wars fan, you will hate it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As a fan of the movies, books, comics, etc. this film got a lot of things very wrong.  Now, fans are left wondering how the force or physics in the galaxy far, far away are even supposed to work.  The Last Jedi destroys the hero of the series, makes the end result of episode 7 seem pointless, and manages to really back the franchise in a corner by implying that there will be no more Jedi, which is a major drawback to the future of interest in this galaxy.  At first watch I think people will be entertained by this film but not long after the show is over it is far too easy to find glaring mistakes in the plot that are infuriating to any hardcore fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There are all sorts of cool battles and lasers going TCHEW! TCHEW! TCHEW! right by your ear. The diversity of the cast was welcome but there weren't enough aliens on the rebel side I thought. Or are there ever aliens on the dark side? I do not know. Seems like mostly humans. I think the people getting upset by this film are those who don't really understand the universe and maybe they just can't be pleased no matter what.

There is so much wrong with this that as you try to lay out the criticisms in some sort of coherent fashion you are bombarded with memory after memory of this mess of a film.<br/><br/>It starts fairly well, the iconic scrolling text and opening are solid despite some daft spaceship designs (bombers... in space? And it ends as well as you might expect) the brief space battle looks good but it too heavy handed and sets the tone for this movie; it wants to be emotionally hard-hitting and slapstick without succeeding at either.<br/><br/>The comedy elements: often mentioned but I found them so unobtrusive or ineffective that I won't mention them further beyond that they were often at the expense of the audience.<br/><br/>The story premise is a fairly good one and could have worked (plucky rebellion are being pursued by a vastly superior First Order force and need to think their way out of almost certain defeat) but every arc and subplot is self-defeating at best or outright awful at worst. The Force Awakens did not do a very good job of uniting the characters it hopes to build this franchise upon and compounds the problem by including more characters that are even less fleshed out - if asked I could not describe Finn, Rey or even Poe except in the vaguest of terms - which leads to the bigger problem.<br/><br/>What the hell is going on? Is there a Republic, who are the Resistance, what situation are they in, what planets got blown up and what was actually lost by the First Order's attack? The world building is non-existent, I have -no- idea what the Resistance is what it's fighting for what challenges it faces and I cynically expect it is kept nebulous to allow lazy writers to shoe-horn in details as it needs them down the line.<br/><br/>I had expected to enjoy this, and I could not believe how embarrassed I was to be sitting there watching this film. I spent the majority of the excessive runtime staring at the screen incredulously; the choices and direction this film takes are breathtakingly stupid in places (Space Leia anyone?) and seriously detract from the story which begins disintegrating almost immediately after the opening scene. During the screening I was in there were regularly groans and whispered complaints, even strangers behind me were asking me if I were seeing what they were, and there was not a single laugh to be had. The Force Awakens for all its faults was still enjoyable, and the audience was right there carried along (admittedly once you left the theater or attempted a second viewing the spell was broken) but this was one of the least joyful experiences I have ever had watching a film.<br/><br/>Everyone outside of Luke Skywalker (with some uneasy character development) was a single note character, they were whatever emotion they happened to be portraying at that moment. From the writing and narrative it was impossible to determine what any of these characters principles or motivations are. Granted, Kylo and Rey get some intrigue that worked better than I expected only for it to unravel in an utterly pointless confrontation towards the end of the movie - and by then I just wanted it to end.<br/><br/>There is so much that did not work in this film and it is bitterly disappointing. I don't think I'll be watching the next one, and I'm not someone who would support boycotts or petitions for a remake or any of that silliness, I have just seen all I need to see and don't want any more.<br/><br/>TL;DR Force Awakens was fun whilst I was watching it, but does not hold up to further viewings.<br/>Rogue One was watchable but utterly meh and suffered from some casting issues.<br/>The Last Jedi was badly thought through, regularly undermined itself and uncomfortable viewing. There are a few good moments peppered throughout, but they are destroyed by terrible writing and confounding plot choices. Not that the Last Jedi is hard to follow, you just find yourself wondering about how these ideas made it to the screen. It reminds you it is a movie at every turn, and a very bad one at that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm a star wars fan who was genuinely excited by 'The Force Awakens' and very let down by 'The Last Jedi'. It wasn't the worst movie ever but it wasn't great. First off - who let Lucas write again? Didn't we decide that was a terrible idea? The dialogue is bad (and yes I know Star Wars films traditionally have cheesy ass lines) and most of the jokes are tone deaf and/or fall flat. Rose's "beautiful lousy place" line was so bad it was incredible. Kylo Ren (arguably the best part of the film) keeps saying "kill the past" and yet all this movie does is recycle the same Star Wars tropes over and over and over again. I couldn't believe the end was ANOTHER rebels-trapped-in-rebel-hold-while-AT-ATs-attack (Hoth did it better). I understand that "The Force Awakens" had to gently get the audience to trust the Star Wars franchise again by lovingly following the old movies but now that you've got us - could you please do something more interesting and new? In general the cartoonification of it all was annoying. I don't need that many stupid creatures. I don't need General Hux made up to look more sickly and evil than in the 'Force Awakens' and then have everybody fling him around like a comic relief puppet. One of the joys of Star Wars is when the writers can walk the line between serious drama and realizing its a space opera. This movie's slapstick stupidity drowned the few dramatic pearls. I have so many things to complain about - the editing and pacing of the film was terrible. Finn and Rose's story was completely pointless. The force was used to do tricks that I guess were suppose to be cool (surviving space?) but came off as dumb. I usually agree with the critics reviews but now I'm wondering if Disney slipped them some cash. I'm writing this review in the hopes that maybe....maybe somebody is listening to the audience reviews (and not just writing them off as angry fanboys). Please use the feedback to make episode IX better!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7956683"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Here is my review and reasoning for my 1 star rating:<br/><br/>I seriously can't believe that the question leading to the ST was "Who is Luke Skywalker" and professional people and self professed Star Wars fans came up with this mess. They took the greatest hero in cinematic history and turned him into a complete failure that gets schooled in the Force by some random junkbaby. Rose says before we even meet Luke that heroes don’t run. Yet that is exactly what they had Luke do for years. Rey is also ruined for me as a character as of TLJ. Tell us she is junkbaby from the beginning. No need for secrecy. Her perfect mary sue-esque routine was slightly annoying in TFA, but I thought that she would be brought down in TLJ like Luke was in TESB or Anakin was in AotC, but instead they make her even more perfect with no failures and able to do everything. She is without a doubt what people feared she was - a MARY SUE. She will have ZERO failures in the ST while they completely destroyed the OT3. Clearly this was a direction from Disney and KK to kill GL's work. White slavers indeed.<br/><br/>I didn’t mind the new characters or the idea of Canto Bight. Some of the sequences there dragged out longer than needed. Mark was outstanding for his work with what he was given, particularly since we know he didn’t agree with it. The OP Force use seemed more like a video game or cartoon than Saga rules. Hux and the FO as comic relief made this seem like Space Balls II more than Star Wars VIII. Poe’s prank call drew groans. Not good for an opening sequence. The chase idea was poorly executed. We’ve never seen fuel being an issue before on one ship, let alone a whole fleet. Also, they could have jumped to different locations and split up. This chase idea works great in a WWII sub chase movie, but this is Star Wars and the FO could have just jumped a destroyer or two in front of the limping rebel ships and pinned them in. The crawl seemed to make it clear the FO instantaneously took control of the galaxy, yet it is said in the movie that it will take weeks to take control of the central/important systems. Milking the monster was not needed and got universal groans in the theater, as did Leia flying. People laughed at Leia. The SFX looked off at times. Ships, particularly X-Wings, don’t move like that in the Star Wars universe. Yoda looked ridiculous and people actually laughed at it. The lightsaber effects were off as well. Fan films have better SFX than these and LFL did well in Rogue One so there is no excuse. The Holdo maneuver was executed really well though. I thought it was a nice place for the sound to drop. The whole Poe-tiny seemed out of place. Luke’s flashback costume looked like a RotJ version in TFA/TLJ color scheme. It looked awesome and I hope they make that Sideshow figure. Speaking of the flashback, you have to be kidding me. From Luke lying about it to Ben’s version to how it actually played out to Ben still looking like he’s 30 years old, all of it was horrible. Snoke was a complete waste. So many threads dropped. They also could have used Lando in either Maz’s role or as the target at the casino. I get what they were doing with the stable kids telling Luke’s last stand, but continuing past that and using the stable boy as the end fell flat. If they would have cut from the kids retelling the story to the rebels meeting up with ships answering the call and assembling a new fleet, it would have shown Luke as a legend and that the spark worked. It would have really given hope. It would have also ended on a more Star Wars style ending. A huge complaint is that the movie breaks the established visual language established for the Saga films. Not a problem in anthology films, but it is jarring in the context of the Saga. It was the first Star Wars film that I have seen with people booing as it irised out.<br/><br/>I know that it doesn't matter, but I will never watch another Star Wars movie or series or buy any other non-Luke merchandise. My collecting that started when I was a kid around 1980 is now over. Congratulations BI/KK/JJ/LK/RJ, you killed my lifelong fandom/desire for new Star Wars content. We will never buy another Disney product, support Disney movies (except for maybe Captain America), or go to any parks again. I will never watch another movie produced, written, or directed by any of the above individuals.<br/><br/>I wish them the same level of success they afforded the OT3. For what they did to Lucas' vision, I simply hope that what goes around comes around.<br/><br/>#NotMyLukeSkywalker</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I didn't hate the movie but from what experienced it was definitely the weakest of the new Star Wars films. I left confused and disappointed. So much of what was setup in Episove VII simply vanishes. No Snoke reveal. Maz Kanata, who is pretty key in Rey's force journey makes a Skype cameo, Hux becomes a dunce. Too much humor, felt more like Space Balls or a parody then a dark, serious film. There were some good moments but I'm really being generous with a 4. It lacked any kind of plot, the time line which is supposed to happen right after Episode VII makes no sense, the First Order recovers in 5 minutes and Hux is finding the hidden, not so hidden base. The main Space Chase was just an awful plot device. I mean ships and people were jumping on and off of the Resistance and First Order ships in that sequence and Tie fighters destroyed the bridge of a ship, almost killing Leia, but no let's just chase them till the run out of gas? The ending was interesting and introduces us to new abilities in the force and the throne room scene with Rey and Kylo was awesome but outside of that the movie was 70 minutes too long, 100 jokes too many, and sought to do nothing then smash the die hard fans construct of the Star Wars universe. Disney is taking this series in the direction of it's Marvel films, so expect cheese, no plot, no real meat to the stories.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

What isn't rehashed from the original trilogy is lifted from Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. There are enormous plot holes. Perhaps the worst was what they did with the last cruiser. If that was possible, why didn't they do it earlier? It makes screeching tonal shifts from the silly to the supposedly serious. The light sabre action is less exciting than in either of the other two Star Wars trilogies. I wouldn't like more Revenge of the Sith wire-fu. Return of the Jedi and The Phatom Menace got this right. The visual design is good, but this is true of most big budget films.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is just plain bad story writing. Throw in making heroes look stupid, etc and this is what you end up with. A pretentious show using "new direction" as a veil to cover up a **** movie.<br/><br/>that is what Disney and all the pundits will be claiming over and over. How can so many fans be wrong or ignorant as they are alluding to? This movie has split the fan base when it wasnt necessary. One can write a good script moves into a new direction logically and makes sense. This was utter garbage and its amazing to see how people defend it.

Everything that was built-up in the first movie, is easily discarded by a highschool plot that wants to be more Michael Bay than the man himself.  Apparently ending with a 45 cinematic scene is enough to appease those whom are easily entertained, so they forget all the plot holes and abrupt conclusions for significant characters.  The rest of us are left wondering why this movie was necessary at all, given how little actual development occurred during the first hour and 45 minutes.  Rey suddenly becomes a sword master *before* Luke begins training.  The master himself, the very embodiment of forgiveness (especially for a family member) is turned into a homicidal, alien nipple sucking (for laughs apparently) imitation of what he is supposed to be.<br/><br/>Edit - to all those claiming any view but your own *must* be due to trolls, you should look in the mirror and see what you have become.  Also, for those blaming the writers, the only writer is Rian Johnson (the director).  You can add a little for JJ Abrams as the Exec. Producer as well, since he should have been paying *some* attention to what was going on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
