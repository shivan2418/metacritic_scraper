Inexplicable actions.<br/>Ruinous cringe-worthy sophomoric and inappropriately-timed slapstick throughout. Took away any sense of mysticism, gravitas, and wonder/awe that was the hallmark of the SW universe.<br/>Completely unimaginative, and rip-off of episodes 5/6 poorly gelled together<br/>Weak "bad-guys" that looked more like they need to be put to bed early without dinner rather than be feared or dreaded. No way these guys could go one weekend without being over-thrown by a million middling aliens with ambition.<br/>Risible annoying minor characters introduced for no point on side tales that went nowhere<br/>Abuse of a generation spanning icon (Luke) who is reduced to a character from grumpy old men and then "dies" for no reason<br/>A pathetic purple haired leader who chooses not to let her crew know her (pathetic) plan and then forgives/forgets blatant mutiny in a casual manner<br/>The list goes on....<br/>WORST OF ALL: It was an insult to the audience/viewers. THERE WAS NOTHING NEW! They have hundreds of millions of dollars to make something novel, and exciting and awe-inspiring. They basically retold the SAME STORY. Can't they think of anything new? Continue to retool same story over and over. I have zero talent - but I bet I could have come up with something more interesting and inspiring<br/>The only way to like this film is to be someone who has never seen any prior SW films. Or, on the converse be so brain-washed enamored with the lore/history and childhood wonder of the prior films that you just can't see this film for what is its - an abject failure at all levels.

So let the angry fans shouting hate, by pointing plot issues, their own projections toward character - all of this doesn't have sense : the Last Jedi is an analogy, one that combines so well with the rest of the saga, an analogy of how is our world, our politics, our moral judgements and more. People should focus on these aspects rather than reducing a movie - which is a piece of art - to a cartoon, to a sum of characters, to a simple story. Star Wars has always been a contradiction between scale, between a family drama and a powers ruling the entire galaxy, a contradiction that remind us of our own world. The last scene of the Last Jedi is just showing us how can we handle this, it gives us hope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Star Wars The Last Jedi is a great continuation for the franchise, it is an extremely captivating film, it has scenes nostalgic and that make the public get thrilled. All characters have their screen time, developing in an exceptional way the old characters and the new characters. The film is beautiful (especially the scenes of space battles), director Rian Johnson surprised me with his work and his way of filming the scenes. Star Wars The Last Jedi leaves the public waiting for the next movie and curious about what is to come.<br/><br/>Sorry for any errors in English.

These wankers of pseudo cineasts had 10 years to cook something of value for the fans, they have all the money, they had countless descent materials to inspire from... and, that's all they can come up with?? this is absolutely UNFORGIVABLE, this is a middle finger to the legacy, a childhood rape of a cosmic magnitude. Disney, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson should be sued for this abomination. This movie is a force feed sh*t unconvincing propaganda, poisoned with the current Western political trends and virtue-signalling. Men are portrayed as reckless, impulsive, dumb animals and women as compassionate, rational, noetic beings; "wooo! yaaay! masculinity is toxic, GO MATRIARCHY!". George Lucas should've never sold the franchise to Disney, and I wish there could be some kind of petition for claiming back Star Wars to the fans or Mr Lucas and finally stop this atrocity, enough is enough. To me, the SW movies ends with The Return Of The Jedi and goes on with the Timothy Zahn Novels, the rest can royally f*ck off. This is a movie made for a specific crowd, for the Marvel audience, the fatherless generation, the low of the low, the vulgar monkeys without pre-fontal cortex trapped in unrestrained consumerism, and hopeless victims of the economic pressure, drones without sense of what is artistically valid and what is not, selfish betrayers of mankind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Easily the worst of the new (disney) star wars movies.  Great visually, I still love the cast, and I even appreciate the "message"; but the plot and dialog feels like it was written by a 10 year old. (I guess that's the target audience).  Really so much is just bad and doesn't make sense.  It's stupid at a Transformers or Pirates of the Caribbean level.  If you liked those you'd probably enjoy this along with your lobotomy.  Worst thing about it is Disney signed this guy to make three more star wars movies.

Actual Review:  This movie is weird, in that it combines goofy humor, bizarre characters, and painful loss against the background of some ofthe most beautiful cinematic landscapes in movie history. In other words, it's a lot like the Empire Strikes Back, where a confused college-aged kid straps a green goblin to his back and tromps around a swamp. When Yoda and Luke first meet in Empire, Yoda steals a granola bar from Luke's supplies and wrestles with R2D2, basically acting like a spoiled brat. Real serious! In Empire, Han, C-3PO, Chewbacca, and Leia basically crack jokes through 1/3 of the movie as they take on famously stupendous odds from scene to scene. The shock of seriousness and silliness juxtaposed in great Star Wars movies has been lost on the great number of persons who are critiquing the Last Jedi for being too funny. If you have a single, brash star pilot attacking an entire fleet, you really think that dude isn't gonna add a little levity? Humor has always been a small resistance's weapon against great tyranny. Study history (or look around at the world today).<br/><br/>And, at its core, this is a movie about what it means to be a rebel against great odds. From scene to scene, Rian Johnson shows--with great heart, jaw-dropping visuals, and genuinely new ideas in a world rotting with copycats--what it means to take on great evil with courage, wit, and a few dedicated friends. There are some ideas that miss, but that's what happens when you try out so many new ideas. When the ideas do land, this movie splits your mind in two at light speed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Many of the narrative decisions here were refreshing too, from plans failing to materialize, chasitizing of reckless bravura in favor of feminine wisdom, lamentations on the ambiguity of good and evil, reluctant father figures, and some surprising tension/tenderness between Kylo and Rey. Still, the movie is genuinely bad through most of its overlong (by a few parsecs) running time. It's a tonal mess and the reliance on humor ends up more like a crutch. It's also just a shame they couldn't have tried to make something good with the material instead. In it's current form, Its really taking a lot of mental gymnastics and Orwellian double think to contort my brain sufficiently and appreciate the absurdity on display in this new Disney trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Riding llamas through Las Vegas???<br/>- Why is there a Hunger Games/Fantastic Beasts subplot AT ALL?? Does NOTHING for the story—the codebreaking sequence is literally totally ditched. Wasted, BORING 30 min. In the middle of a Star Wars movie.<br/>- Rose is a terrible, useless, annoying character.<br/>- Why do Finn and Rose go all the way across the galaxy for THE MASTER CODEBREAKER and then randomly get put in a cell with a perfectly good codebreaker who just happens to be waiting to escape when they need him? - Halfway through the movie I actually thought “I wonder if I’m going to watch this again.” I should *never* think that in a Star Wars film. I still can’t believe it crossed my mind. I LOVE Star Wars. I saw the Phantom Menace and the Force Awakens four times *each* in theaters. I am NOT a hard Star Wars critic.<br/>- SO. MANY. BAD. JOKES.<br/>- Bill Weasley is so freaking annoying.<br/>- We both know the two characters with fake-out death scenes should have died or not had those fake-out death scenes.<br/>- NO backstory on Snoke???? NOTHING on Rey’s parents?? These were major questions from TFA! Rey’s lineage was a MAJOR theme in TFA. No continuity with Abrams. Hopefully J.J. saves these in Episode IX.<br/>- Also, I initially thought The Last Jedi was original. Upon further reflection, I’ve realized that he freaking copied and pasted almost every major plot point from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. No idea what they’re going to do in Episode IX because The Force Awakens already stole everything from A New Hope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Pure ego service for the director. Rian Johnson took 7 films of story, and broke that story in a single film. Most of the tropes from the 7 movies - broken. Strong story elements from Abrams revitalisation of Star Wars - broken. Johnson came into this film like a spoiled child breaking other people’s toys. In the process of “making it his own” Johnson dismissed much of what is good in Star Wars. Furthermore, the story as a one-off was incredibly weak. A “chase scene” that took the WHOLE film. Introduction of a mediocre new character at the expense of character development for established characters. Bringing an immensely self-pitying Luke back in order to turn him into a force ghost. Flying Leia. Snoke as a non-entity. And is Finn an interesting character anymore? From the perspective of story it’s incredibly weak. In terms of spectacle it’s strong - reminding me of...prequels. I hope Disney takes note of the fan response. It will take a number of books and comics to make Johnson’s “story” work for Abrams to build on. Abrams is a miracle worker in terms of bringing back beaten, broken stories - but I’m not sure even he can salvage this. May the force be with him. I really hope Disney reconsiders Johnson for a trilogy...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The force goes from a mystical energy that guides the Jedi to plot armor and silly tricks. If you're not a Star Wars fan you still may want to pass. The story is bloated and many sequences add nothing to the plot. Kylo Ren is the only character with any development. Despite Adam Driver's great performance, it is overshadowed by all the comical missteps. A joke is forced into every 60 seconds of dialog and most miss the mark . If you thought Jar Jar humor detracted from the Phantom Menace just wait till you see this movie. Not a single scene is allowed to be serious in a movie that was supposed to the darkest entry yet. This movie is a hard pass for me and the biggest let down ever in the Star Wars series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Left me disgusted with a terrible taste in my mouth that has completely destroyed all respect I previously had for Disney and any optimism for the future of this beloved, cherished franchise. This installment just didn't feel right and certainly lacked respect for what made the originals great and what Star Wars is/represents. I wish that I wouldn't have seen it. As a lifelong Star Wars fan who truly cherishes this franchise for the beauty and wonder that it represents (or used to), I feel betrayed and broken hearted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This one I feel was actually pretty awesome until the last hour (maybe hour and 1/2..?). First thing, there was too much humor, the trailers made it look a lot more serious, with a dark tone.<br/><br/>The biggest complaint right now for me is the ending gave us nothing to really look forward to in Ep 9. It was like it was building a damn good story then they just were like "Oh you think this is going to happen now? Noooope.. sorry, oh you also wanted this to happen? Not that either.. Sorry." Then they just obliterated stuff they shouldn't of and made a messy film.<br/><br/>Snoke is looking like a wasted character now if he's really dead (the battle with Rey and Finn, and his whole room setting was dope), either way dead or alive they should've teased us with something more on his background especially if hes alive. I wanted him to be Plagueis like many others I've spoken to on here and at Cons, but I was fine if he wasn't if they just gave us some badass story with him. I understand if they want to wait on a reveal until Ep9, but give us a few nice teases in this. Even when Luke was telling Rey about how Snoke got to Ben in the flashback scenes, why not dive into a few sentences on who he is there? Missed opportunities I just kept finding throughout the movie. The Yoda scene especially.<br/><br/>Smaller things that irritated me, you make Poe look like an idiot for an awesome attempt at mutiny, just cause the Admiral couldn't properly communicate to you her actual plan? Would've rather him, Finn and Rose actually pulled off the deactivation of the tracker and Finn fought Phasma maybe to deactivate it. Leia and Poe meanwhile evacuate to whatever planet they went to. I cannot spell it, sorry. The Vulptex (Crystal Foxes) did nothing cool like other indigenous SW creatures. Was hoping for more there, but again that is something I would've let slide. Also, where was an epic lightsaber duel? I loved Rey and and Kylo fighting the Praetorian Guards, but I wanted to see an epic one with Luke and Kylo or even Kylo and Rey. Come on! I still would've let this one slide.<br/><br/>I agree with many others I did not like that Admiral Holdo got the kamikaze light speed scene, should've went to Ackbar damnit! Very little character development with anyone really, those subplots with Finn and Rose were just a waste of time I felt like, way way to long. Took time away from Luke/Kylo/Rey story arc. Rose I also felt like just deviated away from the story progression they had with Rey and Finn from EP7.<br/><br/>WTF was with Leia floating like some space witch? No explanation.. I can let it slide cause it was sort of cool. I look at it as she had unused reserved force ability to save herself. A big "oh **** button.<br/><br/>Also, How are they going to deal with Leia's story now that Carrie Fisher (RIP) has past? The one character I thought would get killed off didn't. (I thought it would've been cool if Snoke or even Kylo had kidnapped her leaving Luke and Rey to rescue her in Ep9.)<br/><br/>Reys parents.. If it is true what Kylo said about Rey's parents and they leave it at that for ep9, then that is just completely lame. wtf is her last name?! give us that even. If so what is the point of saving that until Ep8 then? Lamest cliffhanger ever. Could've told us that in the last one.<br/><br/>Luke's ending was also very disappointing. Especially if he doesn't return as a Force Ghost in Ep9 (If he does I am guessing its small little scenes) The Force Projection and the Force Connect was really cool, but right when we get him actually back you just kill him off after 10-15 mins? I also wanted a real epic lightsaber battle between him and Kylo. No real training for Rey? Especially after what Yoda told him? No Anakin Force Ghost? He also didn't even really stop Kylo like he told Leia he would. He just made a temporary fix to let his sister get away, accepted he failed Ben, and then vanished into the sun? Come on..<br/><br/>As you can tell, I just am not happy. That's just the stuff I can name off the top of my head for now. All the hype for this disappointment. I wanted to like it, but just didn't.<br/><br/>I highly doubt they can make all this resolve in episode 9. Sorry if you enjoyed it and I am bringing you down. I seriously am a huge Star Wars fan, I've seen it twice now and little has changed, in fact I've found only more little flaws in the dialogue.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Simply put, this movie is pure garbage, disguised under the popular moniker. This film clearly wanted to separate its story from its predecessor (Star Wars: The Force Awakens), and in doing so eliminated what made Star Wars great in the first place; good vs. evil. The plot twisted through a number of storylines that varied in tone from one another, all the while refusing to give any screen weight to a defined villain. You could argue the mysterious Snoke is the main antagonist, but he remains too mysterious. There is no explanation of who he is and his demise is about as predictable as they come. And who is the real hero of the story? Your guess will be as good as mine. There is no defined hero, unless you consider the lazy storyline of Luke Skywalker to be the main draw. But the protagonists from the previous film, Rey, Finn, and Poe are all separated through most of the story, and their individual journeys couldn’t be more different or tonally busting from on another. Intermixed you will find miscellaneous characters who are given more weight than necessary, including Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), & DJ (Benicio Del Toro). All three of these characters could have easily been scrapped from the story and the audience would have been none the wiser. And sadly, if you came to see a wll crafted film, you’ll be tacking on another disappointment. Disney handed the reigns to director Rian Johnson, who is clearly caught up in his own story and personal nostalgic feel, rather than even trying to understand how to direct a film of this caliber. A Star Wars film is ripe for technical achievments, and this movie is void of most of it. And don’t even get me started on the “lightsaber battles.” The only sound decision Rian Johnson makes this entire film involves a green puppet. At least Johnson won’t be around for the next installment and we can only hope it’s anything but this mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7867749"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I would give this is a 5.5/10. I really loved some moments in this....and equally despised some others. I agree with a lot of what Kenny said above. Some really beautiful moments that overall were ruined by a hugely contrived plot.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed<br/>1) I enjoyed the interaction between the characters. Luke, Kylo, Rey, Leia, even Snoke were all great in this.<br/>2) The fight between Rey, Kylo and the guards was great.<br/>3) Luke's force projection for his end fight was fantastic. I always felt that this was how strong force users would fight, not with a lightsaber (i.e. Yoda in the prequels). Well done.<br/>4) Great visuals overall. Crait was beautiful.<br/>5) I liked how Luke harped on how the Jedi order was flawed. It gave voice to my distaste of the Jedi as they were portrayed in the prequels. Again, Luke is fantastic in this.<br/>6) It at least didn't feel to me like this was a rehash of any other Star Wars movie. Rian did move the series in directions I didn't expect.<br/><br/>What I did not enjoy<br/>1) Poe/General Hux opening exchange was really corny to me and set a tone right off the bat where I felt uneasy with what was to come. Domhnall Gleeson is flat out miscast for this part IMO. He's a great actor in other movies but in this series is whiny and not intimidating at all as I would think a leader of the first order should be.<br/>2) Supergirl Leia. For her to survive the explosion, then decompression, then come flying back to the ship like she's from Krypton just felt so un-Star Wars to me. Thought I was watching a Marvel movie at that moment.<br/>3) Bombers that require a person to manually release the bombs...really? This isn't WWII. Also, could they have been any slower?<br/>4) The use or non-use of shields, cloaking. Some ships had shields (resistance), others didn't (dreadnaught), some ships were cloaked....their use just seemed to be there to support the contrived plot.<br/>5) The long chase between the first order and resistance....hugely contrived in my opinion. Kenny explained this well above...non use of tie fighters to attack, why didn't some of the FO destroyers jump ahead to cut off the resistance, etc etc etc. Just dumb. And then the resistance need to send someone to find a slicer, board the Super star destroyer, slice into....just dumb. All of this was lazy writing with huge holes.<br/>6) Canto Bight was unnecessary. Although I didn't mind the design etc, it did not add much to the story. See point above.<br/>7) So Luke dies because....he's worn out? Lame, I immediately thought of Padme dying from a broken heart. Felt really contrived to me.<br/>8) The destruction of the FO fleet by the resistance carrier going to lightspeed spits in the face of every other star wars battle ever. Why didn't they use similar tactics to destroy the death stars, etc. And why didn't she do this earlier? Or use the medical frigate first to do this before it runs out of fuel. Dumb<br/>9) Rose. Although I liked her at times, her exposition at other times (being the moral compass that she was) felt really hamfisted and preachy at times.<br/><br/>Did anyone else think Yoda looked odd? I enjoyed his part in the movie but to me, his cgi seemed off.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm just kind of disappointed. There were glimpses of a truly special all time great movie in here.....but some of the lazy writing for particular plot points really ruined it for me. Perhaps I'm too picky, I don't know.<br/><br/>Just my 2 cents.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The humour is too much, too often and too forced. It just isn't fitting in a Star wars film. The plot is shallow and leaves you wondering what was the point in all of those hints in The Force awakens, were they just leading us down the garden path to cash in on that sweet sweet nostalgia? Classic characters are killed off seemingly for no reason and new characters are killed off leaving you thinking, what was the point in episode 7? Kylo Ren flip-flops more than a fish out of water, making him possibly the least likeable character since Hayden Christensen played Anakin. The final result is a film that spends 60% of it's time on a side quest that would have been totally avoided if the rebellion leader had just said 'here's the plan' and another 30% on pretty poor character development. Leaving the fans with about 10% of the film which is actually worth watching. The reality is that if this is a sign of what's to come for Star Wars then the franchise is in serious trouble. Thanks Disney /s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Before I went, I contacted 3 avid Star Wars fans who had seen it, and they LOVED it. So I had hope. Overall, it was quite enjoyable and a solid addition to the Star Wars saga. Sure there were things that weren't perfect, but it's just a movie - one to enjoy. Unfortunately, for me, the middle of the movie was ruined by the guy next to me who was eating popcorn out of a crackly bag and I was pulled out of the movie for a while. Will have to see it again. I recall not really liking the Force Awakens with the first viewing, but saw it 2 more times in the theater and each time liked it better. I expect that may happen with this one as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Last Jedi was quite an experience. The first 1.5 hours is great with moments of brilliance, but that last hour... I honestly thought the movie was almost over, but it just got started. This is one of the most unpredictable recent movies I've seen, please don't get the plot spoiled for you. I've no idea how the sequel will be and that's a very rare thing in a movie franchise. For anyone who thought The Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope and who thought this would be similar to The Empire Strikes Back rest assured, it is not. It's almost 100% original ideas and that's so ballsy. Not every single thing worked perfectly, but I have so much respect that they went into this route. Not everyone will like all the ideas and I can understand if you don't enjoy parts of the movie because of this, but I still can't believe they actually went there. The acting is unbelievable. Hamill is amazing, but Adam Driver is the true star of he movie: seriously Oscar worthy. I actually got emotional twice during the movie near the end and I didn't see it coming, it just hit me. I want to see it again right now. For the last 20 minutes I kept wishing that it wouldn't end and if a 150 minute-long movie makes you think that you know it's a good one. Personally I enjoyed The Force Awakens, but this movie blows The Force Awakens out of the water and then some. Empire will (probably) always remain my favorite Star Wars movie, but this is top 3 Star Wars material. Even though Empire is my favorite I dare to say that the last hour of The Last Jedi is the best hour ever in a Star Wars movie. I have to let it sink in for a while, but if you're doubting if you should see it, go immediately! I think the first 1.5 hours of the movie is an 8/10 & the last hour a 10/10. So you'd say that a 9/10 would be reasonable, but I'm giving it a 10/10. That last hour was just so good that it elevates the entire movie and shows you that you need the slower first part to prepare you for what's coming. I think that the first part of the movie will be even better on a rewatch.  P.S.: this movie has received quite a bit of hate the last days. I read the negative reviews and I don't agree with them at all. Yes, this is a very different Star Wars movie and not what you expected when you went into the theaters, but that doesn't make it bad, especially not when all the new things are handled so perfectly. Quite the opposite, it makes it the most refreshing Star Wars movie since Empire.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Characters felt flat, plot was flawed and boring, the pacing couldn't be worse... The secondary arc, or side quest, is completely pointless, not adding anything to the end of the film and being a complete failure. A lot of bad humour, cheesy and cringeworthy dialogue, lots of weird alien animals getting in the way of the scenes... it reminded me of Attack of the Clones, but with a worse plot. Oh and don't get me started with Snoke... what a waste of a character, what a waste of a villain. As generic and boring as they get.

They didn´t respond to our demands. Cinematographically speaking it was good and it was a good story but the focus too much on innecesary things and humor that was good but from my point of view they had put most of the film around it. The act of luke was the mostremarkable thing of the film, but at the end because his attitude in the beginning doesn´t match with the luke we used to know. To conclude i think it was a good story but not well made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Some bad humor, these pog things that are apparently supposed to be cute but don't actually do anything.<br/><br/>They even try to rehash the "Traitor" line from Force Awakens but it was just bad.  The fight scenes were badly filmed....<br/><br/>The only real redeeming qualities of this film involved Rey and Ben.... Adam Driver and Daisy were excellent but the direction was just so bad and it didn't help that many times there was just humor which wasn't funny and was rather pointless (like much of it in the casino).  As someone put it to me... it felt more like a Disney film than a Star Wars film and is a HUGE stepback from Force Awakens and definitely Rogue One which was the pinnacle of the Disney Star Wars universe so far.  Force Awakens had some odd moments too (like the aliens chasing them on the transport vessel when they captured the Falcon...  but that was better directed.<br/><br/>I can see that I should've come here instead of Rotten Tomatoes for a review but even there now, the users are rating this at around 56%.  Still, I used my Movie Pass and paid nothing to see it and I'm still feeling ripped off.  :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

So how much did Disney pay these critics for these rankings? The writing was absolutely atrocious. It reminded me more of a mix of Star Trek and Hunger Games, more than Star Wars. I am now so happy to hear JJ Abrams will be returning for the last movie, but appalled that Rian Johnson is getting his own trilogy. Wait for this move to come out on Netflix. Even then, I wouldn't ever recommend it if it wasn't a Star Wars movie and necessary to watch to understand what happens in the final movie (which hopefully, but i've lost nearly all hope, redeems this trilogy).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's not perfect and you might not like it. I won't spoil anything, but some parts seem like filler, the porgs obviously serve no story purpose and the pacing and some choices seem a bit odd at times. I enjoyed watching Star Wars Episode 8 though, I will see it again without a doubt, and I look forward to episode 9. The film is fun, some jokes don't land but oh well; there was moments when I was genuinely shocked, sometimes the shocks are cheap and have no actual meaning but I still had my mouth open at more than one point; and finally there is some genuinely good themes and scenes in the film, some themes are shoehorned, but others were relevant and you can hate me but I think a lot of the big choices and twists were good ones and I enjoyed watching them unfold. Go check out the film- but don't think it's gonna answer the universe's questions or anything.

Finn's entire storyline does feel exactly the same as it was in TFA, which is a shame and the worst bit of the movie for me. They could have been more original in that regard.<br/>Johnson made some decisions I wouldn't have made in writing and shooting the movie, but all in all it is a great movie, with its heart in the right place, and which might leave people a bit depressed at the end of it.<br/><br/>The lesson of this movie is failure, but I look forward to how much higher these characters will be able to soar in the last chapter of this trilogy.<br/><br/>The creature designs were amazing and used at the appropriate times to bring some lightheartedness into an otherwise very dark movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7867020"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The first half is a cheap copy of ESB, almost copying some aspects of it line-for-line. It begins with an evacuation. Rey, a young person from a remote desert planet, is about to learn from the last existing Jedi Master who's in exile on a hidden, watery, misty planet with rough terrain, and every second of this makes you hope that some aspect of it will be fresh. Meanwhile, Finn and his not-a-princess girlfriend goes and meets a swindler/gambler type person who sets him up with an imperial ambush while Leia is being frozen. The silver-armored bounty hunter gets the credit and reward for the imperial setup. The subordinate lord (Kylo Ren) of a dark lord (Snoke) sets a trap for the protagonist (Rey) and she goes to him and falls right into it. Sound familiar? It's exactly what happens in ESB.<br/><br/>The second half is a cheap copy of ROTJ, almost copying some aspects of it line-for-line. Rey hands herself in and is taken to a throne room in binders with Emperor Sid-I mean Snoke and Lord V-I mean Kylo Ren. She witnesses the near-final destruction of the Reb-I mean Resistance through a patterned window. She sees the conflict within Kylo Ren and turns him onto her side and he defeats Snoke during a period of overconfidence. Meanwhile, Poe thinks that Finn will have that tracking device down, he just needs to give him more time. The millenium falcon comes down to the planet the rebels escaped to and drives ties through a trench area that just happens to look dark-reddish and mechanical and the thinking is the narrow route might destroy them. Sound famiiar? It's exactly what happens in ROTJ.<br/><br/>What little remains of the film is unique. Luke dies due to an aneurism from using the force so much that he effectively had transformed into a force ghost and left his current existance, resulting in his vessel's aneurism and death. When he realised this he completed the transition into a force ghost. His death felt bizzare, pointless and unexplained, frankly, since nobody even killed him.<br/><br/>There is no proper lightsaber battle in this film. Finn fights with a vibroblade. Rey fights Luke with a stick, a bit. Kylo and Rey sort of clash their lightsabers a tiny bit, but not properly. Kylo and Rey team up to defeat the Royal Guards and their vibroblades in a lengthy fight. Luke's force duplicate clashes his ghostly lightsaber with Kylo Ren, a bit, sort of. There's no proper lightsaber battle at all, yet the untraditional fighting scenes, mostly involving vibroblades, oddly leave you more satisfied than the films which had full blown lightsaber battles. How this is I do not know.<br/><br/>The ending leaves the story in the same place it is at the start of EP4, with a strong (albeit less strong) empire and a weak rebellion. Since it's hard to follow what happens in these new films, the Republic had their home planet and government destroyed in EP7 paving the way for the First Order to win over star systems and once again become the dominant government of the galaxy with the good guys being rebels again.<br/><br/>Perplexingly, although Leia appeared to die, she managed to survive because of her force power. It appeared to be an excellent way to kill her off given her real life death, but instead she appears to survive in the film and continues to be the overarching general of the Resistance (or Rebellion again now, I guess). And Disney have vowed not to reuse recent footage or use CGI. How they will explain that away in a way that isn't lame, without any footage of her, is as perplexing to me as it is to you, given how her son Kylo will want to interact with her. Had her actor lived though, I would not have a problem with the way in which she survived, unlike many other reviewers.<br/><br/>To be fair, there is original stuff weaved into everything that's been redone and I'm sure there is a long list of personal achievements for the cast and crew in this film, but as a viewer watching the final product you just cannot ignore how it did a cheap copy of not one, but two previous films to the point the lines were almost identical or deliberately cringey.<br/><br/>To be fair to Rian Johnson, he almost had no choice but to rehash EP5 and EP6 after JJ Abrams' previous film rehashed EP4. Furthermore, there is little you can do other than to repeatedly train up a new apprentice every 3 episodes and build them up the same way Luke was, while there is only one other Jedi left. In order to create original storylines, they need to re-establish the Jedi Order and the Sith Empire so there is the same capacity for originality that KOTOR and SWTOR have had.<br/><br/>In spite of this negative review, the film was better than The Force Awakens because of the originality that was weaved in, the feeling of it being longer and the fact it didn't feel like we were rushing through it so much. Unfortunately, it was still worse than the original 6 due to the sheer fact that it is a rehash of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I haven’t been able to get rid of this knot in my stomach of disappointment and feeling upset since watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I don’t blame Disney because they got it right with The Force Awakens and Rogue One, but I do most certainly blame Rian Johnson. He has single handedly ruined, if nothing else, the story of Luke Skywalker. Remember, the very last time that we saw Luke was as a wise, strong, teachable, and good natured young man that had just faced his Father and the Emperor. He had very humbly burned the suit of Darth Vader after having a heart wrenching first and last conversation with his real Father.<br/><br/>Jump to now, The Last Jedi, we meet a resentful, selfish, and angry Luke who is only worried about himself as he says “I came here to die”. And why? Because Kylo Ren turned on you to the darkside? So that’s how this once wise, strong, teachable, and good natured Luke deals with challenges, to isolate and think only of his failure? Not to mention the fact that he has ‘lost his faith’ in the Jedi and his once perfect understanding and humble use of the force? Just because it would appear Mark Hamill is a little resentful and overly sarcastic at times doesn’t mean that’s who we knew Luke Skywalker to be. How can anyone really watch the original trilogy now with the same feelings towards Luke knowing what a loser he ends up becoming? Why care about Luke at all anymore? He doesn’t even care for Yoda it would appear. How contrasting was that compared to the last time we saw them together?<br/><br/>The movie felt like constant projection of Rian Johnson, projecting his own person opinions and resentments and humor (that he personally finds funny) in nearly every single scene. There were times I felt like I was watching The Hunger Games and no longer Star Wars. Purple hair, come on. Why do we have to modernize, and in turn ruin the greatest movie series ever made? The planet of gamblers and casinos also felt like Hunger Games and the police looked like they belonged on The Incredibles. My son adores Star Wars at age 6. But he won’t be able to watch this film for years to come with all the overly intense and dark nature with Snoke, far too much compared to what we’re used to which is saying something. And when did Star Wars decide to swear constantly? Talk about trying to ‘get with the times’ in a world where swearing isn’t nearly as offensive or uncommon as it now is.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about flying Princess Leia’s and how pathetic those AT-AT’s now look compared to those pointless other machines next to them that are far larger and apparently supposed to be cooler. I want Episode 8 back with a clean slate and pray that someday, someone will remake it and retain the sanctity of what it once was. But how? Mark Hamill will be gone soon and we’ll be left with the memory of how we once viewed him in his role of Luke Skywalker before Rian Johnson destroyed it all with his own projection and agenda.<br/><br/>Any movie can entertain you, but Star Wars has always been about more than that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Force Awakens was called unoriginal and uninspired in its strive to rouse a sense of nostalgia within people. Well, The Last Jedi makes it abundantly clear throughout the movie that it is not afraid to skew from the paths of traditional storytelling and make the experience a highly more high-risks endeavor. These twists and unorthodox directions the movie takes, however effective in weaving a different and innovative storyline, are a huge risk that ultimately made the movie as polarizing as it was. For fans who are not afraid to stray away slightly from the strict format of other star wars movies, this movie will be all fun and emotion that keeps you interested because it never goes the way you think it's going to. For fans who don't like the transitional role of the sequel trilogy (ushering in a new generation of galactic heroes while saying a respectful goodbye to the classics), this movie will be incredibly frustrating. This star wars movie is a lot more fantastical than the rest, making very different decisions in terms of storytelling (this is the first star wars movie, I believe, where we get a real flashback) and in cinematography. The movie is very divorced from the rest of the franchise artistically, it has no remorse in taking much more flamboyant strides with its cinematography that makes it very unique visually. However, where this movie excels in, is the development of Rey, Luke, and Kylo Ren's characters as they are easily the three protagonists. It takes turns with characters that we weren't expecting in ways that will leave you reeling at how badass some scenes were... but also empty at the lack of resolve it provides. It answers a lot of questions, but not in a manner that is satisfactory or proportional to the two-year wait that it took to get them, and because of them, you leave the theatre feeling... unimpressed-- as if the answers were thrown into the script only after the bulk of it was written just to please the fans. However, one question goes starkly unanswered, and it doesn't feel natural, it feels like the moviemakers just genuinely couldn't think of a good answer so they didn't even bother. But maybe that mystery was intentional... who knows.<br/><br/>Unlike some reviews say, this is not the best star wars movie since Empire Strikes Back, but it is better than The Force Awakens, especially for fans with more of an open mind towards the franchise.<br/><br/>Going into this movie expecting a strict, algorithmic movie, like The Force Awakens, would be a mistake, and why many fans left the movie emotionless, for they were expecting a classic star wars tale, rather than (if I dare say it) a revolutionary method of star wars storytelling.<br/><br/>As for story points and some of the subplots, The Last Jedi leaves a lot to be desired. Some stories are unnecessarily convoluted, while others have noticeable plot holes that you really only realize once you finish the movie. The major ones of these, really, leave you unconvinced that the enemy is really worth the fear or that they hold any real threat.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a healthy and much-needed break from the classic star wars method of storytelling, while still keeping true (usually) to the classic Lucas quote: "It's like poetry. It rhymes." It answers questions in ways no star wars fan was expecting and takes the story to unconventional places (whether that is a positive or a negative is up to the audience solely). However, ultimately, this movie suffers from the change in director. The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi are radically different in most respects and it feels like Rian Johnson didn't agree with, or care to continue, some of the plot threads JJ Abrams had left, so he cut them short and focused on his own story.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie feels more like an end to the story than a middle, as if the new movies should not be a trilogy, but instead just two movies.<br/><br/>This movie will excite you throughout, if you don't think too deeply about the stories, but does not do its job at leaving questions or plots unattended to in order to excite you for the next one. It really feels like this movie was tailored to be a finale, even though it is confirmed to not be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The only one that should have been existed. This is not a 10 because the movie worth a 10. A user score of 5 is unfair. The movie is great but it does not have the Star Wars feeling anymore. It's been done for a wide range of people and little new fans. Times are different from 40 years ago. We should open our point of view before judging this movie. I've found some scenes frustrating - i.e. Leia in space...wtf? - the Casino part is horrible. Luke's struggle within it's lacking of passages, too Obi Wan style. Even if since the very beginning he was a kind of pessimist - i.e. Yoda's training on Dagobah. I felt the force only in few passages. It's not what I wanted to see.

No, sadly it is not.<br/><br/>First of all: I won't spoil anything in this review! Now for the Movie, I came into this with massive, probably to massive, expectations. The Force Awakens (TFA) was alright - a good introduction into a new era of Star Wars but also borrowed to many plot devices from A New Hope. So, for me, in order to fall in love with this new trilogy, The Last Jedi (TLJ) had to really become a new Empire, a Movie that embraces all that's great about Star Wars and expands on it while also surprising the audience with new and unexpected twists and turns. And while the movie succeeds at the latter tasks, by really delivering some memorable and unexpected scenes, TLJ managed to really mess up the "Star Wars" part of the movie. It just feels like a fan film at times. A really good one, that comes close to Star Wars but never actually manages to create the same atmosphere and tension. This is mostly due to some questionable story decisions (that straight up make no sense at times), too many characters (its hard to get involved with a "core team" like back in the original trilogy with Han, Leia and Luke. TLJ has a tone of characters but that means each them only gets limited screen time) and the Movies tendencies to make scenes unnecessarily funny. You will know exactly what I mean after you've seen the first 10 minutes. Many scenes are just dark, serious and in their essence really good - until the awkward joke moment. I don't want to spoil, so let me give you an unrelated example: Imagine you watch the Vader scene in Empire, and just after the " I am your father" line Luke would respond with a little wink and a "Oh really?". A little tiny moment, that would change the whole movie. TLJ is full of these little moments, that are forcefully funny and sadly just don't work for me. They destroy otherwise really amazing moments for no apparent reason. And then there are some moments of magic and a long and really unnecessary "safe the animals" subplot adding salt to open wounds. But enough complaining, there is also a lot to like about TLJ . Its really well made. The visuals are stunning, the creatures are great, the Worlds amazing and the space battles intense and beautiful. The Soundtrack is on the expected level, meaning really, really amazing and just everything about the production is almost flawless. Also certain characters are really well developed, Kylo and Ray have some great moments and some of the stuff I don't want to spoil is just really amazing. Overall this is not a bad movie, nor ist an unenjoyable one. But I wanted to leave the cinema with a big smile on my face - and I didn't. As a movie this is a solid, enjoyable 7 out 10 - a really good movie, but not a masterwork. If this wasn't a Star Wars movie, I would be happy with it. But as a Star Wars movie, it did sadly disappoint me overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They are so much fun. But The Last Jedi doesn’t want to remind you of anything. It doesn’t care about your relationship with Star Wars. The only relationship that matters here is Rian Johnson’s relationship with Star Wars, and for the first time in a long time, here is a Star Wars movie with a proper point of view, one delivered by a storyteller who is unafraid to shatter a universe he loves, to break down the heroes that mean so much to him. A wise and noble Luke is easy. A Luke with regrets? That’s hard. That’s tough to swallow. That’s what elevates The Last Jedi beyond a simple retread – it asks you to take these characters seriously in a way that other Star Wars films have not, to acknowledge them as something beyond a vessel for escapism. Star Wars can only matter in the long run if it’s given the room to grow. And right now, it feels like the sky is the limit. Right now, Star Wars feels…unsafe. And that's great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7866892"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">When searching for a descriptor for this film, pedestrian comes to mind. If you are looking for a patchwork quilt of nostalgia that blatantly grabs entire scenes from Episodes 4, 5, and 6, this is the movie for you. It seems like its creators were not interested in doing anything other than tugging at the strings of nostalgia with the hopes of selling tickets to the masses. For a long awaited movie like TFA, it worked, for TLJ, it becomes cumbersome and tiring. Every scene, and I mean EVERY scene and narrative element is taken directly from its predecessors. Master Jedi training scene with reluctant Jedi Master (ESB) it's in there; throne room confrontation with a powerful leader who pushes for the "dark side" (ROTJ), it's in there too; cheesy bar scene, got it; Journeying to the other side in the form of the cave of reflection while being trained(ESB), got that too. And the list goes on. When the movie attempts to be original, it only provides non-sequitur moments and characters that only confound the narrative and confuse the viewer. The movie is like a bad cover band who hopes to get you dancing by playing the tunes from your youth, but winds up failing miserably because they are horribly out of sync and out of tune. It becomes ever clear that this movie will be a jumping off point for SEVERAL franchise knock offs looking to do nothing but take our time and money with the hopes of capturing nostalgia and providing unnecessary back stories that only further confuse the audience.  Like Luke and his gratuitous milking of the beast on Jedi Island, and choking it down in one gluttonous gulp, Disney will continue to force the magic of that "green milk" Galaxy of nostalgia down the throats of fans who are asking, no begging, for something of substance on which they can chew.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7862399"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I have absolutely no idea how this film is getting bad ratings.<br/><br/>Well actually, that's not true.  I do know.  Fanboys.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what direction some of you wanted this movie to take, but as a lifelong fan of the series, old enough to see the original when it and I were still young I was delighted when Rey's turned out to NOT be the offspring of anyone prominent or shocking.<br/><br/>I also felt that the handling of the Rey and Kylo's struggles with the force was spot-on, as was the explanation and exploration of Luke's failure.  The way each of these characters expressed subtle emotions and soul-searching in these scenes was night and day from Anakin Skywalker's "turning" in the prequels.  In fact, while I've never been as down on those movies as some, seeing similar scenarios and processes handled well, makes me feel worse for what those movies could have been.<br/><br/>Could we have learned more about Snoke?  Sure.<br/><br/>Did some of the last-ditch "saves" feel a bit stretched?  Indeed - but that's true of not just every Star Wars movie, but just about any film of this nature ever made.<br/><br/>For the most part though, this movie was incredible.  It avoided being predictable, while being careful not to go with the polar opposite of the expected outcome often enough that it became crass.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how you can watch this and say that the characters don't undergo development.  I mean, the way detractors are talking, you'd think the original trilogy fully explored Han Solo's history, background and motivation.  Do we even know how he became best friends with a Wookie?  Nope.  We didn't need to.  Tying up loose ends was my biggest issue with the prequels.  Boba Fett was cool because he had a menacing demeanor, a cool look and he was mysterious.  Knowing his backstory, literally removed one of his defining characteristics.<br/><br/>Personally, I think TLJ stands with Empire as one of the greatest films in the series.<br/><br/>Oh, and an enormous THANK YOU for returning Yoda to his wise but wryly mischievous self.  After the stilted, pompous, joyless, one-dimesional know-it-all that episodes I-III presented us with, it was literally a joy to see the restoration of my favorite character.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Yes, I even found some enjoyment in episode 1, 2 & 3 (nobody can deny the action scenes were epic!), but The Last Jedi was a complete disappointment from top to bottom. The action was lame, the story was lame, the jokes were lame, the pacing was off, and of course the acting was atrocious. I believe the only reason the critics and some audience members are giving this a glowing review is primarily due to Carrie Fisher's passing. The film virtually has no redeeming qualities. Thankfully, this is a one and done effort from this director. Hopefully, Star Wars can get back on track with the next episode.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Episode VII sucks for what I said before and is a ripoff of The Empire Strikes Back!

I really appreciated the way the film grapples with themes of disappointment and failure. It would have been really easy to make a Star Wars movie that pandered to exactly what fans and mainstream audiences wanted to see (arguably, The Force Awakens does that a bit too much), but I don't think that would have made for a compelling narrative. Sure, there are flaws with the plot of The Last Jedi, but none are so overwhelming that they overshadow the central point of the movie: we must learn from our failures as much as our successes, our weaknesses as much as our strengths. I thought Rian Johnson communicated an emotionally and philosophically complex story that really delivered. If you've grappled with grief and disillusionment in a serious way, this may be your favorite Star Wars film. I know it's one of mine. Thank you, Rian Johnson, for making a Star Wars film that was so different from and better than my expectations. I look forward to your future Star Wars films!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Emperor's throne room scene, the Hoth battle, the flying over the deathstar while turrets shoot at them, etc.  It all feels like a huge effort to play it safe and work from a pallet of known Star Wars scenes and moments.  Think of it as Lego Star Wars.  Plug and play the same known shapes together in a different order.<br/><br/>The humor, seemingly forcibly injected into the movie would be more at home with Starlord's crew.  It didn't sit well in the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>So much seems pointless.  There's a side adventure that they engage in that serves no point.  If they had never gone, nothing in the movie would change.  You could easily edit out 30 minutes of footage and the movie still reaches the same conclusion.  Which gets us to the gratuitous, bogged down middle section, with the part where Obi Wan rides a lizard through the streets and over some cliffs, I nearly fell asleep. Seriously, I was shaking my head trying to stay awake. The other side plot could have and would have been resolved by the General simply taking 10 seconds and explaining to the officers what the plan is.  I'm no fan of complicating storylines through the assumption that people are too stupid to talk to each other.<br/><br/>There's a lot of talk in some circles about shocking moments that left them stunned.  I didn't see any.  Of all of the characters, where's the character growth? Ask yourself if Rey is any different at the end than when we found her?  Is Kylo really different??  Poe showed a smidge of advancement at the end.  Ultimately Finn is the only character going through a transformation in these movies. He has a solid arc and progression as a character.  But ask yourself...  if they edited out Finn and everything he did in this movie, would it change anything? At all?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is a Lord of the Rings style science fiction film set in a parallel Star Wars universe. A lot was "thrown out the window" with the direction the film took, including just about everything that makes a Star Wars film feel like Star Wars. Further more, it is bewidering how Disney managed to release Rogue One a year ago which absolutely nailed the Star Wars "feel" to the film, yet manages to release this a year later, which is completely tone deaf to the setting of the franchise.<br/><br/>It makes no sense to defend the film's new direction when it doesn't remotely fit in the Star Wars universe, and to simply dismiss/label everything preceding this film as just the nostalgic views of a bunch of old nerdy people is not only insulting to those who support the franchise but completely insensitive to the decades of lore and millions of hours of work put into building the universe. It is evident from reading such reviews that facts and setting no longer matter when expanding upon an established setting, and that change for the sake of change is seemingly self-justified for the purpose of spitting in the face of those who have done nothing more than simply support the Star Wars universe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

At 152 minutes, the film could have packed an immense story, but decided to cram three different plots with no connection to the other. The flow ended up feeling like flying through an asteroid belt. A diversion onto Kanto Brine and meeting Benicio del Toro served no purpose than to introduce new commercial toys. It functioned no purpose on the plot, and worst of all, all new characters did nothing. In all, this film lacked any theme. It had an inconsistent tone, inserting jokes in the most serious intended scenes. Did Marvel writers stumble on the wrong project?<br/><br/>This film felt like an insult to anyone who enjoyed Star Wars. It destroys purpose of the Jedi; the purpose of training; any sense of consistency; and worst of all, any purpose of a story in a franchise. The film literally tells the audience dressing in masks and costumes is stupid, not to look up to heroes, there is no bad or good, and most stinging of all, there is no need for reading texts or back stories. Burn all copies of this movie and refer anyone asking for Episode VII or VII to play Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Came out so disappointed.  Never had a Star Wars movie that you walked out of and everyone you talk to was like "Im not sure what to think"  The more you thought the worse it seemed.  Though a fast paced movie with many good parts, nothing seemed to come together.  Then, everything is rushed together at the end to wrap up bad writing.  The Main Plot is 2 capital ships chasing each other in and out of hyperspace.....thats it!  Couldn't come up with something better?  Totally destroyed Luke's character.  Wasted Chewbacca and just a glimpse of R2.  Leia was Superman?  really? It was the swinging on the vines in Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.  Luke milking a boob creature?  I really wanted this to be good and kept waiting on the edge of my seat, but it never came.  Then finally Luke walks out to face the resistance and I thought here we go, they could do something awesome here and make this a great movie with one final scene, but nope.  He isn't really there and dies from the effort of not really being there.  What?  The most famous Jedi in the Galaxy and he dies of exhaustion?   Really only had 2 scenes that I was a fan of:  Yoda and the throne room scene.  Glad Abrams is back for episode 9 but not sure what he can do with this.   Maybe Luke didn't die and can re-materialize not in ghost form.  Maybe he just phased somewhere else.    Really I wouldn't have liked it but would have been a better movie if Luke turned bad.   Hope they recall their decision to give this director a trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

After a plodding 2 and a half hour run-time, The Last Jedi leaves those characters at nearly an identical spot to which they started, only now with a sense of apathy from the audience.<br/><br/>This is not a good movie. This will be kept spoiler free, which will keep things shorter, as there is no need to get into specifics (which could be literally every scene), but this movie suffers from awful writing and structure. Few scenes are established, most characters/actions don't matter, and throughout the entire film for nearly every Rebel action you could ask, "Why are they doing this again? What's the point", and each time The First Order is on the screen you could ask, "Why don't they just...?". It's a shame because there are some worthwhile scenes in the films final act, but by that point all the flaws have added up to a point where it's tough to care about anything or anyone on the screen.<br/><br/>It really feels like the Rey/Kylo/Luke story was the only idea for the movie and every other scene was pieced together around it, each created by a different person, the day before production began.<br/><br/>The Last Jedi is not a good movie. It's frustrating to think that anyone that watches it from a critical standpoint could possibly argue otherwise. It fails as a captivating and coherent story on the most basic of levels (Writing 101 level stuff). It's not simply a story decision, or one issue people are nitpicking, there are over a dozen major plot/structure/tone issues, etc and if you want to delve further into those I would suggest reading the more lengthy spoiler reviews. Full Disclosure - I was planning on rating the movie a 4, but for some reason 4 = Yellow. I think this movie deserves a negative review, so i bumped it down to 3 to adhere to metacritic's rankings system.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

A lot of plot progressions and subplots were just there for the sake of advancing the plot. Many characters and scenes were wasted to advance this plot. Yet the plot somewhat ends up being hypocritical and not creative, rather than being entertaining. On one side, we have characters who are portrayed as bumbling, war-crazed idiots. On the other side, there are characters who oppose the 'traditional resistance movement' because it perpetuate hate, etc. Yet these same characters perform hyperspace kamikaze on the enemies, perpetuating hate. What is the message? First Order's atrocities were well-portrayed on the first movie and there was a reason, albeit being stale and unoriginal, for resistance. Now, there is some random side-character who preaches this 'both sides are dumb puppets to the weapons industry, get out of war,' 80's hippie philosophy. Yet at the end, our characters again promises to fight for tomorrow to undo the First Order. Again, what is the message? A lot of twists and cliche breaking were done for the sake of just having such. If the producers wanted to create something new and revolutionary, that is not a Star Wars, they should have done so by not abusing the franchise name and nostalgia value of the IP. When you were raking gold with this IP and promptly attempt to create this edgy, 'modern' twists on the IP through a lot of plot-holes and conflicting messages, don't expect the audience to take it so kindly. At the end of the movie, when almost all the old casts are wiped away, we have these bland characters with near to none character development over two new movies. We have a main antagonist who is still this man-child who has anger-management issue and teenage emo angst. I am not sure what should I be expecting for the last movie. What is the message and what am I supposed to expect out of all this?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movies is not zero to anyone that actually reviews it, the movies is a zero only to people that want to purposely drag the score down. This movie is at least a 7, even to people that aren't very fond of the universe. The effects, the acting, the dialogue, all done very well, so even if you disagree with the way it was written, you should still appreciate the good things.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

However, I get 'mentally taken out' of a movie when there are too many unnecessary 'jokes' and 'slapstick moments' within a story that is largely designed to be taken more seriously than not (OT had slapstick moments, but mostly with the characters meant for these moments and they were carefully placed). This is especially true for scenes that are supposed to highlight the lore that makes SW so great. It's fine to have comedy, but if scenes clearly designed for gravitas and emotion get their bubble popped by unnecessary, and in many cases strangely placed, comedy you start to lose your emotional investment in both film and characters. Disney and Rian take this to new heights here and it's just not for me unfortunately. This movie is for kids and teens not a 35 year old fan of the OT. I'm afraid Disney SW movies wont be the revival I'd hoped and I'll just have to re-watch the originals from time to time (although Rogue One was pretty darn good).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The best selling items are still the main trilogy, go ask how many kids want a Jar Jar Binks toy. The best scene in Rogue One was the Vader Hallway battle. Vader, Luke, Han, Leia, R2D2, Lando...these characters haunt the hallways of Disney.<br/><br/>The only way forward is to literally cut away the umbilical cord of the original trilogy and forge ahead with something new, while balancing what made this franchise so precious to so many.<br/><br/>----SPOILER----<br/><br/>The Movie's entire third act is about running out of Gas....and that one scene where Luke is drinking green milk. I don't know if Rian Johnson was trying to making an in-joke. If he was, he should have left it to more talented directors like Taika Waititi.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Most of the humor is not funny, terrible with timing and just distracting. The movie in general try to go in all different directions at the same time, all the time, and of course fails. It's just a lack of focus. Acting is mostly bad, writing is bad to ok, lots of inconsistencies and plot holes (like why general Lora Dern won't hyperjump into First Order capital ship as soon as she realize that rebels plan is **** up? She just watch her comrades die, "hang there, buddies!". Makes no sense.<br/>Luke. Ok, it's so much a real-life, old bored man, mid-life crysis, I won't use Force again thing. I don't think writers realize how much anti-star wars this kind of stuff is, but think about it - you don't watch star wars to be fed this **** you already have this **** in real life! This supposed to be flashy fights, jedi knights vs sith warriors, epic space battles, edgy adventure kind of thing.<br/><br/>Princess Leia space swimming: makes literally no sense. Looks weird in a bad way. Quite ****-up.<br/><br/>**** SPACE BOMBERS?!?!! **** YOU DISNEY THAT IS ****. "Hey, we'll very slowly float above you in **** SPACE to **** DROP BOMBS on you! IT IS SPACE, THERE IS NO GRAVITY HERE, THEY WON'T FALL.<br/>There is reason we lived for 6 episodes without space bombers - cause it's retarded and won't work, got it? Just fly some Y-wings over, fire cool fast torpedoes into critical structural points of big enemy ship, finish 'em with big lances or whatever.<br/>This movie is too long, this movie falls apart, most of the characters are not interesting. Boba's Fett awkward death in the Return of the Jedi is nothing compared to how Snoke is tossed into the window, or Finn's ex. commander, or about dozen of other characters whom I can't really remember - not only their names, but also their looks.<br/>It's star wars soup opera, not star wars movie.<br/>Not enough action to be episode 5, not enough redemption to be episode 6, but enough Jar-Jar to be episode 1. or 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This felt like being diddled by your favorite uncle for three hours then offered ice cream afterward. Every single major plot point and mystery from Awakens is wasted in the worst of ways. Star Wars has always bordered on hokey and corny but it had just the right tone to keep it dramatic and serious. Rion Johnson didn’t understand that and went full on Lucas (ep I-III) with the tone. I was waiting for a laugh track to kick in during the very first scene it was so bad. F this movie and Rion Johnson! Do not support this trash. A waste of some of the best characters of all time...the people raving about how great this pile was would probably be just as entertained watching dogs hump for three hours...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

With a storyline that is utterly captivating, and some powerful performances, this is a satisfying film for fans that delivers on its promises with ingenuity, providing some of the most awe inspiring cinema moments in recent memory that are sure to be revered in years to come. Whilst some dialogue is occasionally overly simplistic, the script is generally a delight that further endears us to characters we are now intimately familiar with, An experience that will stay with you well after you leave the theatre, I will certainly be seeing this again on the big screen.
