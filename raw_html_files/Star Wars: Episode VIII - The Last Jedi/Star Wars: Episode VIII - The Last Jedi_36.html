The story felt disjointed from start to finish and worst of all, the story had no heart. I actually enjoyed The Force Awakens and entered the theater tonight with great promise. I left very disappointed yet hopeful Abrams can put this mess back together in the finale. 5/10, to be honest, is being generous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The kid at the end has control of the force if you didn't catch it. He pulled the broom to him. Phasma toys sold by the thousands before the force awakens. She was HUGELY advertised and now we are to accept that she died (though it's possible that she lives despite the mass explosions). The escape ships get massacred while purple hair women sits and watches. She waits until there are like 5 left (remember, she is already on a suicide mission, just waiting for fuel to run out) before she turns to ram Snoke's ship. Luke dies why? How? He had that nice x-wing in the water to raise so he could leave the planet. If Rian wanted Luke dead, what the **** was the point of having him do that **** force projection? Why not have him die like Obi Wan? I mean, i get that dying while watching the rising sun kind of goes back to the franchise's Japanese roots, but it's like going around your elbow to get to your **** So force protects an individual from the extreme cold of space. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. Someone prescribe me with Zoloft. This movie left me more depressed than The Mist and The Road combined.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

People beg for originality and creativity and when they get it, guess what? They hate it or spit on it. This is the reason why we don't get original ideas/concepts. Alright onto the film. First of all the actors and performances were all incredible, but Mark Hamill steals every single shot when he is in frame. Also Daisy and Adam are incredible. They better be right? They are the lead roles after all, but well done. The movie looked incredible down to every detail in design, costumes and CGI, and you can not forget about the creature models/designs. Some of the best creatures I've seen in a movie in a while. The story I felt was really engaging and felt more complete this time. It felt more of a fantasy and oddly enough a thriller at least to me. It has all the Star Wars fighting, lasers and Stormtroopers dying, along side some really awesome 1 on 1 fights and some surprises I did not see coming sprinkled in. Overall if you are a fan of Rian's work or just love Star Wars see it in theaters, and actually give originality and creativity a chance it might actually shock you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

As a matter of fact, the main solutions on the movie were done by those whom we couldn’t imagine. Beyond that, we could realize the importance of each character of the movie, and it made the movie more dynamic. The end of Luke Skywalker was perfectly built and acted. I would never think of a different ending.<br/>The footages were really nice and the soundtrack was fantastic (I mean, it’s a Star Wars movie).

That was a big surprise for a Star Wars movie, and I've realized this was not a Star Wars film!  The feel was Disney or Marvel. You could miss this movie in the series and that wouldn't be bad. Ohh, and it had some pretty scenes. ***Spoilers***<br/>The opening was the same as Thor. Comedy was way over the top and almost speaking directly to the audience(can you hear me now?) Not the comedic tone you will get from the first 6 films. The plot was so full of holes it was painful. Terrible writing. Every character, decision, and plot point is written in for convenience with no thought to how or why. This could be described as a writers attempt to make a world war 2 story about a fleeing ship trying to escape a massive fleet. How do you keep them from getting killed, make them fast. How do you keep them from getting away, add new tech that the top guy doesn't even know is on his own ship. Need to spice up the plot, add a completely avoidable mutiny. Need to get on to the aggressor fleet, pointless painful side plot that doesn't fit at all. Need to save the people in little ships(that in empire strikes back were hyperspace capable), ram the enemy fleet. Need someone to sacrifice for emotional investment, use a brand new character we don't like. Dark side master dies pointlessly, light side master has to do the same. Need your main character back from the bad guy ship, umm let's just not try to explain that one. I think I saw this movie in the 60's. The characters weren't developed, and nothing gets explained. This felt like a collection of Star Wars scenes from earlier movies layered on top of a 60's plot. If you are going to make a Star Wars movie, make a Star Wars movie. Don't make a fan picture begging for money with laughs. Keep the same Star Wars style and feel, take it serious with situational humor on the side. Don't slap us in the face with it. Left the theater empty and unmoved, writing this disappointed. Give us Jar Jar back if that's what it takes to return the rest of the film to quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Disney should be ashamed. Trivial, extraneous subplots that don't make any difference at all to the over-arching "story," terrible creative choices related to the primary antagonist who is carelessly tossed aside without any explanation, countless other examples of disregard for already established canon personalities and story-lines (including Luke Skywalker himself), make this perhaps the worst "Star Wars" movie ever made — if it could even be called that.

While some shots are beautiful and a few scenes even compelling, the overall movie is a contrived mess that takes an ax to the story of the previous films and providing only some tensionless action schlock in return.  Many character decisions are utterly baffling or groan-worthy, and one even provides a new Worst Line in the Saga - yes, below even not liking sand.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie weighs on you like some Dark Side user is trying to choke you from a system away.  It deserves recognition for its quality cinematography and a few well-executed scenes, but the overall product is not worth spending money on.<br/><br/>Yes, I would personally consider this movie worse than any of the prequels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I won’t drone on and on about it but I will say that I am so happy that the movie didn’t play it as safe as ‘The Force Awakens’ did (and that’s not to knock TFA, I really enjoyed that movie) but it did regurgitate a lot from ‘A New Hope’. In this one, we get a lot of creative twist and turns, engaging story arcs, some genuine surprises and an abundance of thrilling action sequences.<br/><br/>While I could nitpick about certain bit moments, the only thing I wasn’t really crazy about some scenes involving Finn’s subplot - those could have been handled better, in my opinion. That said, I am so happy with this movie. I will definitely be seeing this one multiple times in the theaters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Adam Driver is much less of an angry-teen-type as Kylo Ren in this one and I loved seeing the "light"er side of him. The space battles in this movie gave me anxiety but in a good way, I didn't know whether to close my eyes or sit on the edge of my seat. When I thought about it on the way home some of the lesser characters arcs seemed to be a bit unnecessary but I think they exist to serve the idea that not everyone has to be some revered hero. I got very emotional seeing some older characters return but also was wow'ed by the new sets. The standout part of the film for me was the costume design particularly on some of the newer, more red enemies. I will definitely be watching this a couple more times at the Cinema and I cannot wait to get this on a home release so I can pick it apart even more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

That was Luke's warning on the trailer and oh boy, seems like a lot of people didn't listen to that. I really enjoyed the movie and was surprised again and again. It's fun, heartwarming and overall a solid 8. I knew people would have trouble with some stuff but I didn't find them particularly bad. The plot builds upon the lore established on the novels, rises debate about the true powers of the Force and the role of the Jedi within it, offers a close up to the struggles of the members of the Resistance and resonates with a message of wonder for the future. The visuals were truly breathtaking with some of the best scenes I have seen in a Star Wars movie... it actually made my jaw drop in a couple of shots as I was taking in everything that was happening. Obviously, the music is superb. Yes, there are parts where the pacing slows down and I guess they could have been handled those better but they were not detrimental to the movie's enjoyment. It does make me wonder how are they going to handle EP9 with how things end in this movie. In any case, I can't wait to take my niece to watch it together.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

To be clear, I don't usually invest my time on the internet complaining or hating on other peoples creative efforts just be cause I don't agree with their choices.<br/><br/>The last Jedi is an exception. I'm driven by the rave reviews by professional critics to provide a counter point, and it seems many many other fans are too. This movie isn't just bad because it doesn't fit the Star Wars "formula", it is bad because it doesn't  fit the "interesting and engaging cinema" convention.<br/><br/>The pacing and plot are flat out bad. This is not simply a matter of this movie "Dancing to its' own beat". The flow of the story creates a jarring viewing experience and the plot doesn't movie along with any real purpose. The story itself is strange at best, terrible writing at worst. New characters are introduced with confused motivation and no sense of purpose. (Rose, Holdo, Del Toro) Others that were introduced in the previous iteration are cut down before they contribute anything solid to the story. (Phasma, Snoke). Our new heroes seem to stagnate, especially Finn and Poe.<br/><br/>The one exception is possibly Kylo, who is faced with some of the few moments of interesting emotional tension and is well acted by Driver. Rey, a new character I loved in TFA, is in limbo. She doesn't end up having journeyed anywhere as a character through this story. Sure she is put in some challenging situations and faces conflict, but where does it all leave her now? How has she changed or grown?<br/><br/>Our old heroes, Luke and Leia seem stuck in a bizarre parody of their former struggles and achievements, Mary Poppins-ing through space and milking alien sea cows. Add to this a drawn out casino sub-plot replete with alien horse race getaway and a few "wow that looked cool" moments. I'm willing to admit, given some time this might be passable for an afternoon's distraction, maybe on the level of Attack of the Clones, but it is certainly not great cinema and far from a great Star Wars movie. The adoration slathered all over this thing by the mainstream press is beyond bizarre. Sure, much loved franchises like Star Wars are prone to be divisive, but the overwhelming sentiment of disappointment is mounting and people will question how these glaring issues have gone almost completely unnoticed by the pros.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Lifelong Star Wars fan here. Another reviewer said that watching this made her long for the prequels, and I was amazed to find that I totally agree; (extremely) flawed though those films may have been, at least Lucas had a grand vision. Here there are only fleeting glimpses of the old Star Wars magic, drowned in a stupefying story whose central crisis makes little sense and which sends the interesting characters from Force Awakens off in bizarre and pointless directions or doesn't meaningfully send them in any new direction at all. Questions raised in Force Awakens are blithely cut up and laughed at in this movie. And god, don't get me started on the downright insultingly lowbrow Marvel-esque attempts at humor. The most difficult thing to see was what was done with Luke. In an interview, Mark Hamill said his first response on reading the script was that he "fundamentally disagreed with every single choice Rian Johnson made as to Luke Skywalker." On seeing this film fans of the original trilogy will sadly learn that that wasn't just Mark making fun chit chat with the interviewer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The battles were absolutely edge of your seat intense from the very start. I loved the attention to detail in all the props and costumes and CGI. The new characters were great and as Luke states in the teaser, "this (movie) is not going to go the way you think!"<br/><br/>I have minor gripes but I won't go into spoilers. They could have trimmed some time from scenes. I believe there was line in that was intended to be comedic but fell a bit flat. Other than that, this was an absolute triumph! I cannot for the life me understand why some fans have given it such a negative review other than there is a certain subsection of our society which have all lost their minds at the moment.

So after Rogue One was so good I had hopes that this one would be better and that Disney would have learned from their mistakes they made in Episode 7. Well They didn't. :(  They made the SAME EXACT mistakes as Episode 7 with repeating things that happened in the original trilogy over and over and over again.  They also went with the Marvel philosophy and had some corney Jokes (namely the very beginning of the movie) and some things that just didn't make any sense/are not possible.  I'm looking at YOU Leia!  My dad saw the movie and I was talking to him about it and he said he went to the restroom about 30 minutes into the movie and another patron was mumbling of how Disney has ruined Star Wars.  That man walked out of the theater and didn't even finish watching it!  THAT is a HUGE problem.  Disney is alienating the VERY people who LOVE WITH A PASSION this IP.

I didn't really care about Snoke, but I'm really pissed off on how they handled Captain Phasma, she had so much potential to be the next Boba Fett, but she barely gets any screen time, wtf. CGI was okay but you can clearly tell that all of the creatures showed off in this movie were made clearly for merchandising, this may sound weird but we need more disgusting, ugly creatures in this movie, we need a new Jabba. The Leia space scene [kind of] makes sense but the execution of the scene was bizarre, uncomfortable and just **** stupid, probably one of the worst Star Wars scenes ever. The Finn & Rose subplot was filler, you could literally remove the subplot, hell, you could also even remove Rose from the movie and it would barely be different. The best scene of this movie for me was the light speed ramming, Holdo at first was an unlikable prick, but she redeemed herself when she went out in one of the most badass ways I've ever seen in a movie, ramming the Star Destroyer at light speed and the audio went completely silent, while this movie had one of the worst scenes in Star Wars, it also had one of the best. Yoda is also in the movie and he doesn't feel that forced, and he states to Luke that failure is the best teacher which would end up being a subtle theme throughout the whole film, everyone fails at one point in this movie. I found the movie enjoyable, and I would recommend watching it if you wanted to see something wildly different from Star Wars, this film felt like an experiment by Rian Johnson to me. I think this is better than The Force Awakens because of the amount of risks and experiments Johnson took making this film, it's a different from any other Star Wars movie I've seen, and I welcome that, especially in the current state of these types of movies.<br/>Here's where I rank this film compared to the others from best to worst, keep in mind this is just an opinion.<br/><br/>Empire Strikes Back<br/>A New Hope<br/>Rogue One<br/>Return of the Jedi<br/>The Last Jedi<br/>The Force Awakens<br/>Revenge of the Sith<br/>The Phantom Menace<br/>Attack of the Clones</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's almost like there is a segment of people that automatically gravitate to the polar opposite of the conventional wisdom. So this thing gets great reviews across the board and poof they hate it. This is a great movie and sad it largely getting hammered because it got such great reviews. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. Lots of twists, genuine scenes that had high gravity (something totally missing from the prequels). I genuinely disliked the prequels as they were almost like watching a cartoon. This movie was excellent and has a very real real Star Wars feel to it in every way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

However, the entire second act is made up of nonsensical plot points, excessive CGI (worse than anything in the prequels), and scenes that could have had emotional weight had they not been made to be incredibly short. The third act is also okay, despite many instances of poor dialogue and character development. As such, the movie gets a 4/10.

Again we see another predictable death to conclude the chapter, as fan favourites take a back seat to one dimensional token characters. Former trademarks of the franchise such as lightsaber battles and epic narratives are exchanged in this edition for a romantic comedy's worth of humour, shoe-horned into the film at the most inappropriate of moments. The big questions remaining from the previous installment are either brushed aside or ignored in a strange attempt to belittle fans who actually enjoyed episode VII. The future of the franchise is bleak if the last three films are any indication, as it is blatantly obvious Disney is not prepared to put in the work required to make a great film along the lines of Lucas' work and is merely concerned with cashing in on their purchased logo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Star Wars seems to be creeping into comicbook super hero franchise territory. I don't see all of those anymore, and if I do get tricked into one and dont like it, well then I don't go to see that film multiple times. Because thats what i enjoy, a film that makes me feel good, interested,or anything, something. I wont be seeing Last Jedi again. My least favorite Star Wars movie. The comedy worked, but was just the same joke the entire film done over-and-over. Nothing resonated very well for me, just a total disconnect. All that firepower and tech and I feel like no characters, plot, or anything at all moved forward, nor looked back well enough, no added mythos, no questions answered. A meme gif reel of a film. Saw on IMAX RPX, but the cinematography was disappointing, even if it was purposefully vintage. Adam driver was apt with a poor script. Finn is screaming to be better written, Boyega could give so much more. Leia could be added to a blog about another potential hidden sith lord in the star wars cinematic universe. So many evil Jar Jars in Last Jedi if you look at these characters decision making. I felt that the ending was like watching a tv show that I decide half way was a poor choice and I just shut if off, click, over, so what. The movie should have ended directly after Lukes reaction to being handed the lightsaber from Rey. Luke, atleast, knew wtf was going on here. Yoga-Luke phoning in his wisdom. I had high demands, but still, least favorite, which is a long list at this point, that will never stop growing. The origin of blue-milk is not the fan service I was looking for. Animals are cuddly and our friends, thanks Walt Disney. We know.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Poe is a colossal gung hoe cliche that suffers no consequences for his actions. Snoke's story has no payoff. No explanations. They destroy Luke's character. No respect/understanding of the Force. Not enough alien characters, they just replace them with colored people (seriously wtf? I say this as a brown man). This is a Marvel movie in space (and not the good kind like Guardians of the Galaxy). Humor comes at inappropriate times leading to weak drama and no gravitas. Rey is still unnecessarily powerful and overall there are no explanations for anything. Really mad at where Disney is taking this beloved and magical franchise. Help me George Lucas, you're my only hope...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

He makes his truimpent return after all these years of being absent from one of the most beloved series in the world. It didn’t feel much of a cliche as the last movie and presented a decent amount of adventure and action. I liked how both good and evil characters questioned one another’s moralities instead of being cocky heroes or diabolical bad guys. They filled in the blanks to Kylo’s mysterious upbringing and introduced a few new interesting characters in the mix. Did not dislike any characters, scenes, or special effects. The only thing I could say negativly about this movie is that Rey and Finn barely had screen time together. Glad there was no cliff hangers left this time. Gives us a better sense that next movie will begin with something fresh to build off of.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

That fight scene in Snoke's chambers is the best lightsaber fight scene in any of the movies. It's raw and primal, without relying on laughable choreography to carry a scene.<br/><br/>But if you like your space opera's to have a real story with flow, TLJ is easily the worst in the franchise. It's pandering to a social-justicey type crowd, and it's not even good at doing it. There's an open sore of an overtone that every male in this story is either evil or grossly incompetent. Or both. And every female in this story has lead-plated plot-armor or unimpeachable character. Or both.<br/><br/>Holdo is supposed to be this stotic War Admiral who Poe immediately dismisses for being a female ("That's Holdo? Huh, not what I expected..."). Holdo's rebuking of Poe causes him to believe her marching them out of fuel and to certain death. Multiple times she is asked what their plans are, and multiple times her answer is a falsely stoic: "Steady Ahead".<br/><br/>"She's a stronk independent space womyn who don't need no flyboi."<br/><br/>This leads Poe to ultimately hatch a plan that dooms the few survivors of the Resistance he didn't sacrifice for a Pyrrhic victory over a Dreadnought. The remaining survivors (of the initial 400) are wittled down to a size which very comfortably fit on the Millenium Falcon. 20-40 people? So a 90-95% casualty rate. If you include the fighters/bombers from the first scene it's definitely over 90%.<br/><br/>While Finn and Rose are responsible too, Poe is a Commanding Officer who's ultimately to blame in virtually erasing the Resistance. Leia's smug smirk at the end because Poe has finally learned his lesson and is a NOW a good leader? Oh now he is? After killing 90% of the last bastion of hope in the galaxy, NOW Poe is ready.<br/><br/>Jesus yoda-muppet christ. Poe was a GOOD character in TFA. He was a spy/pilot that was cool and collected in the face of impossible odds. In TLJ? He's Maverick in Top Gun; A hot-head misogynist who shoulda just listened to his Instructor Purple-Hair. Pfft, typical man.<br/><br/>I walked away from this movie thinking, "No **** wonder the Resistance is in such dire straights, with these objectively retarded leaders."<br/><br/>Rey and Kylo are the only two who salvage this trainwreck of a movie, and Kylo is a whipping boy for the first half of it. Rey's character is the only constant good thing from start to finish in this movie. There's so much more wrong with this movie than I've listed here, but I've only scratched the surface of this abomination and it's 9 paragraphs long.<br/><br/>The only redeeming part of TLJ is that it's going to be a warning against letting SJW's sink their mandibles into any of your favorite IPs, because that's the core reason this movie stunk to high heaven.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I can honestly see the hand of the suits a play in the writer's room.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7857808"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The Last Jedi is a polarizing but poignant film that takes exciting new directions with established concepts that seems to me an incredibly worthy evolution of Star Wars. It shrugs off the formulaic approach taken by The Force Awakens (and to an extent, Rogue One) and takes the cast and story in a bold new direction but, unlike many may think, does not rewrite the rules of Star Wars.<br/><br/>Action movies tend to favor the bold, brave heroes, but this time around they are put in check by more cautious, albeit conscientious, leaders. Right off the bat, Poe leads a reckless victory that is marred by the amount of casualties and loss of ships. He, Finn, and Rose end up concocting a bold plan to infiltrate the enemy fleet to temporarily disable their tracking system for just long enough for the rebels to escape, but end up nearly getting the remaining resistance members decimated. It’s in fact Admiral Amilyn who saves the day by evacuating the resistance to a remote planet, then sacrificing her life to save them from Poe’s miscalculations by going at light speed straight into a First Order star destroyer. While Leia’s role is not prominent in this film, her wisdom as a leader is shown in brief glimpses and through Amilyn as a disciple, while our new heroes are forced to contend with the consequences of their approaches.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Rey and Kylo Ren is beautiful and amazingly portrayed. They struggle with being pulled in the opposite direction of where they want to be pulled, yet find a powerful connection in their mirroring struggles. There are callbacks to Vader and Luke here, but their stories go in completely different directions that are legitimately surprising but also feel entirely natural. I was not convinced that when Kylo killed Han Solo that he was completely free of his light side inclinations, but I never expected how much harder he could fall into a downward spiral. And that’s where killing Snoke was such a brilliant twist - unlike Vader’s killing of his master, which definitely brought him back to the light, Snoke’s death marks Kylo’s true descent into darkness, filled with a hatred that can (seemingly) never be cured. Rey’s hope for Kylo’s redemption is shattered along being confronted with the painful truth that her parents were nobodies that simply abandoned her, but she does not give in to his desperate attempt at turning her to his side.<br/><br/>This movie tears down the old masters and gives birth to a newer generation of light and dark users of the force. Kylo is not Snoke, Rey is not Luke, yet both of them have definitely picked their side. Luke’s downfall is perhaps as tragic as his father’s, and while he hasn’t turned to darkness, his light has certainly been snuffed out for a long time. His final sacrifice is so true to his character (humor included) and a beautiful redemption, as well as an exciting cliffhanger to find out what the Jedi have learned about existing as force ghosts (I highly doubt this is the last we see of Luke).<br/><br/>The Last Jedi is filled with a lot of surprises and revelations that I’m sure are eliciting some negative responses from people. But the way I see it, these all fit in perfectly with the established universe while not being a retreading of old ideas, and that’s exactly what I wanted out of this movie. It’s what George Lucas would have done anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Unwatchable does not begin to cover it. I don't have anything to say about this joke of a film except that this time around, Disney must have not only paid the critics but bought them all their own private islands to have garnered such reviews. To true Star Wars fans: avoid at all costs, and Mr. Lucas, you have my deepest apologies and sympathy. Very expensive trash, and it worries me that Disney will now own 21st Century Fox, too. Will people even remember what a good film that has depth of story rather than pushes a weak and manipulative agenda is anymore in ten or fifteen years? This is junk, plain and simple. Disney has thus far tanked Marvel (compare the first X-Men film to the latest Spider-Man), Pixar (compare Ratatouille or Up to anything from the past five years), and Star Wars (the prequels were genius compared to this). Is Star Trek next on the chopping block? Doctor Who? Will they only be content after they have bought and destroyed every beloved property that has ever existed and twisted it into something crass in the name of their bottom line? Not only will I no longer shell out for Star Wars, but for any Disney-owned property. This is a disgrace. Full disclosure: Love the OT, liked in my own way the prequels (at least they had narrative and drama), didn't like TFA, not at all, but this is beyond the pale. Puerile, predictable, and clearly designed by committee or algorithm to generate the most possible profit from the least common denominator. If you must see it, wait for streaming, and make sure you don't pay extra for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The biggest thing was that so much stuff happened in the film that could have been cut out that you'd leave 1 scene and go away for half an hr with 2 other characters on a little adventure and lose track of what you'd been watching before. 2 1/2 hours of people running around and shooting at each other and at the end really nothing much had changed. As well they were always talking about how powerful these jedi and order sith guys were but really nobody did much force stuff at all. The light sabre fights were poorly choreographed None of the characters communicated with each other which made friction for no reason.<br/>Daisy is not a great actress and pretty much just played this by the book with 1 or 2 facial expressions .<br/>This film has no replay value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm 20 years old and have grown up with Star Wars. My Dad was a huge fan and took me to see episode 3 on release day. I wanted nothing more than for this new era of Star Wars to inspire and bring generations together once again. Unfortunately, my worst fears about Disney acquiring the franchise have been realized with Episode 8.    My worst fear was that Disney wouldn't understand what made the original trilogy so great. At least the prequels made an attempt to capture the essence of Star Wars. Sadly, Disney has made it clear they only care about the marketability and financial gains of their new IP. While ep. 7 was a spiritual successor to ep. 4, The Last Jedi was essentially a tone deaf, half-hearted attempt at episode 5. I've never felt the need to create an account and write a review before but I cannot let people feel the utter disappointment I felt after this movie. But on to the specifics.    - The Movie is incredibly jumpy. The movie starts where ep. 7 left off, but this time as soon as characters are reintroduced they split off. There are 4/5 separate story lines going on at any one time. There simply isn't enough screen time to fully develop nearly any of the story arcs and it shows. Luke and Rey are the only ones with any sort of meaningful character progression.    - The development of most characters is nonexistent. Fin loses any intrigue and interest gained in the first movie. They attempt to touch on the Fin/Rey dynamic but its horribly misplaced. The movie adds several completely unnecessary characters that serve almost no purpose other than to pad the run time. Fin's entire side story is useless. It doesn't progress his character, the new characters added through his story are bland and just flat out unlikable.    - The little character progression written in is flat out bad. Kylo Ren is even more of a cry baby. They try to dive deeper into his motivations but falls flat. The movie makes its obligatory 2-3 C3PO/R2D2 lines only to leave them out. The one character with any intrigue is killed off so unceremoniously its insulting.    - This is more of the Star Wars nuts like myself, but the lore is horrendously just shrugged off. Nothing is continuous from the past established lore. The introduction of B-52 like space bombers are incredibly insulting when Y wings exist. The First Order is the most incompetent, shadow of the empire you can imagine. Watered down versions of Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader ruin any sort of intimidation factor. The main criticisms of the prequel trilogy centered around how Anakin was just seemingly a whiny baby. Well bad news is that EVERYONE in the First Order is much, much worse. The Rule of 2 is just completely disregarded along with much of the other Star Wars lore in favor of pushing a more marketable and shallow line of reasoning.    - The worst thing in my opinion though is how much you can sense the "Disney Influence". The humor is so forced I winced several times. Rather than having several comic relief characters they needlessly force it upon everyone. From Luke to Fin to the stupid side characters they jam it down people's throats. The movie also avoids ANY meaningful hard topics or themes. It's easily the most predictable movie this year. It's a very child focused movie and that's what sets it so far apart. We begged the director to make some bold choices but I guess his idea was COPY AND PASTE shot for shot Matrix and Independence Day scenes. The movie is just so focused on selling as many tickets as possible and forcing child like themes and writings. Everything that made ep. 5 the best of the original 6 was attempted to be more kid friendly. The themes of loss, and hopelessness, and the enemies actually on the offensive is dismantled.<br/><br/>Im sorry if this review ran on or I rambled. This is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write one. I can't give this movie a 0 or 1 because there is one scene between Luke and Yoda that actually captured the essence of Star Wars. BY FAR AND AWAY the best writing, screenplay, etc. of any scene of the 3 most recent movies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not even the prequels did this much damage to the franchise as this single movie has done. I understand that the newer generation had to take over at some point. However, the way Rian Johnson has gone about accomplishing this task just desecrates the entire legacy of Star Wars. This movie is nothing but a massive back slap and complete disrespect to every Star Wars movie and character that has come before it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I would rather watch Attack of the Clones a hundred times over than watch this disaster of a movie again. Between the hatchet job on Luke's character and his arc in the OT, the forced comedy and tonal issues, Rey's force abilities being completely unexplained (I think they are changing the force into a superpower that requires literally no training now based on the scene with the kid at the end), the heavy handed shoehorning-in of the "next generation" characters who I find to be completely underdeveloped, unlikable, and annoying, offing Snoke without any backstory or answers. And the biggest WTF moment which was Leia flying through space and turning what at first I thought would have been an acceptable sendoff for Carrie into one of the most weirdest and distracting scenes in the entire franchise. Even Laura Dern was disappointing, there was something about the way she acted her character that was off-putting and didn't really work for me. This movie was an absolute trainwreck. It felt like TFA and TLJ had completely different tones to the point that it was distracting. The way TLJ handled force powers and Rey's unbelievably fast transition into force-god makes me feel like this universe is cannibalizing its own rules and the dissonance between the 3 trilogies is reaching ridiculous levels.<br/><br/>My issues with Luke's character in TLJ is that he faced down Palpatine and Vader in the OT, always believing there was good in Vader and successfully redeeming his father. Seeing the good in others is central to Luke's character. Kylo Ren has done absolutely nothing to earn the same level of respect story-wise and from the audience as Palpatine and Vader. He's a nothing, a poser. That has been established by TFA. So Luke's conflict with Ren feels so...wrong. It doesn't make sense. He was being manipulated as a teen by Snoke, and Jedi Master Luke couldn't do anything about it and actually considered murdering him in his sleep before Ben even attempted anything? After everything he accomplished in the OT? Are you kidding me? TLJ not only retroactively makes TFA worse, but also makes the character journeys of both Luke and Anakin less meaningful.<br/><br/>I can't be the only one extremely annoyed that they never bothered to flesh out the New Republic AT ALL? Or at least explain how Snoke was able to create such a strong military in the shadows to be able to overthrow the government? Now that the writers established that Snoke was a joke deserving no background or context in lore with his anticlimactic death, we're supposed to believe that the New Republic was just that weak and incompetent?<br/><br/>Positives: Benecio Del Toro, the creatures, seeing Mark Hamill again even if his character was butchered. I'm glad Rey's parents ended up being a nonfactor, I was holding my breath thinking the movie was going to disappoint me further with an awful reveal.<br/><br/>I miss George. The Sequel Trilogy is severely lacking in the coherent vision and themes present in both the Original Trilogy and the Prequel Trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

General Hux is reduced to being comic relief.  Snoke (probably the most interesting character in the prior movie) is killed off.  No explanation of who he is or where he came from, just wasted in the middle of the movie. Rey still manages to become a powerful Jedi with no training (?).  Yoda appears, well just because.  The slapstick is just gut wrenchingly bad.  The "your on hold" scene (near the beginning) elicited audible groans.  Finn is still completely uninteresting.  The only bright spot was Mark Hamill's performance.  For the first time in my life, I can honestly say I'm really not interested in what the next film has to say, and that's saying a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It has really bad moments but there are also breathtaking scenes, both direction-wise as fan service wise.<br/><br/>The reason why I didn’t like TLD that much: the movie basically said f*ck you to everything that episode VII and JJ Abrams was setting up.<br/>Rey is a nobody, so what was the point of the force vision in TFA, why should I care about her? Snoke’s plot was a big thing for me. He had SO MUCH potential, if Rian Johnson cut the crappiest part of the movie (act 2 in that casino-like planet and that PETA bs with the Chinese Jar Jar) and gave us a flashback showing Snoke’s past, who is he, how he recruited Kylo and made him go to the Dark Side, why was he so powerful, how he build the First Order from the reminiscents of the Empire. WE GOT NOTHING. Absolutely NOTHING. They killed Snoke in his second REAL appaearance in both episodes VII and VIII. Come on guys! You have **** Andy Serkis, a true legend and that’s all we got? Really? It seemed like Rian just wanted to clean up all of JJ Abrams work in TFA. It was a huge disappointment.<br/>Now all I see is a very predictable plot in ep XIX. To be honest, I really don’t see that much material left to work with.<br/>TLJ was a huge mess with some very good moments, like Yoda’s appearance, Luke’s last moment, the space battles, Poe’s character development, Rey’s relation with Luke, the cinemaography, this is hands down a gorgeous movie, and the best looking Star Wars. it introduces poorly developed characters that have no story at all instead of focusing on the characters TFA already established and needed further development (Snoke, Mas, Phasma, Hux, etc.). Instead of that horrible casino sequence, instead of Rose and DJ, why not try to develop more characters Rian already had? I would have love to see Mas’s story, her place in all of this, how she found Luke’s lightsaber. Phasma’s presence, once again, was useless.<br/>Commander Holdo was a very good addition to the Star Wars movies, she was incredibly charismatic and I could perfectly see her replacing Leia’s post in ep XIX, being the leader that the Resistance needed so much and honoring Carrie Fisher’s legacy, but no, they killed her right away.<br/><br/>I got out of the session with mixed feelings, and I still need to rewatch it for a second time, but this is my opinion for now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Is not the best of all, but is good, and there are some things that are interesting. Even that the movie is 152 minutes long, it doesn't´t feel that long. I like Episode VII more than this, but this movie feels a little more epic. Rain Johnson is a good director, not only let us see the characters developed in the way they do, but also visually, is stunning. The performances are amazing, specially from Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill, not saying that the other actors are not good, because everyone is great, but Daisy and Mark gave the best performances of their careers in this movie. The issues of this movie, at least to me, is that the movie takes some decisions that they were not good for the movie (like the direction of a character, and the fact that the movie could be 20 minutes short) I would love to explore Laura Dern character a little bit more. Also, the movie could use some more dark moments. Leaving that behind, the movie was entertaining and has some epic moments, that in the future, Star Wars fans will look up to.Not the best Star Wars movie, but it´s a good one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7856935"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Something fishy is indeed going on with critic reviews.  It's insane how well-received this film has been, both here and rotten tomatoes user scores are split down the middle while critics are unanimous with praise.  To the movie itself.  The in-universe plot-logistics are horrifically bad in this film and in fact insult the audience's intelligence.  The MAJORITY (>70%) of the movie consists of a long-drawn out chase scene between two fleets going on in the background, the First Order giving chase to the Resistance.  This is justified by the Resistance having moved out of the effective range of the First Order ship-mounted ordinance, thereby withstanding the barrage for longer.  Do what now?  THEY'RE **** SHIPS!  YOU'RE DRIVING **** SPACESHIPS!  MOVE CLOSER/CATCH UP TO THEM FOR **** SAKE.<br/><br/>This single contrivance is essentially the core of the film.  It drives the entire plot, which involves the forgettable new cast LEAVING THE FLEET while it's under fire to find a computer hacker on SOME PLANET WAY THE **** SOMEWHERE ELSE to help them bypass the flagships shields to disable the onboard hyperspace-capable tracking (but without anyone knowing, because then they could transfer the tracking to another ship - oh but only one ship tracks through hyperspace at a time, like they can transfer it to another, but only one at a time can use it, so removing it from the one ship will work, just as long as no one finds out about it) which plan by the way they arrive at on the HUNCH that they have this simultaneously universe-breaking and incomprehensibly brittle tech in the first place.  That complete drivel will occupy, as I said upwards of 70% of the film.  The other core flaw in this film is Disney's refusal to take anything seriously, in the form of jarring Marvelesque quipping and tonal shifts.  The opening sequence following the crawl is by far the worst, or at least most noticeable example of this.  The First Order, upon arriving in their arguably menacing cruisers, are immediately established as the butt of ever possible joke to be made, courtesy of the striking and incisive wit of Po Dameron in the form of your-mom jokes.  The pure incompetence of the villains of this film, including that of even the once-somewhat imposing (we can at least give him mysterious, right?) Supreme Leader Snoke, is astounding and deflates any possible tension this film could have cultivated.<br/><br/>This is not intended to be a complete accounting of the film's flaws, just the most grievous.  I expected to be disappointed by Luke's inevitable death, but I tell you truly that by the time that happened, I had long since stopped caring. This is a sad excuse for the continuation of the beloved Star Wars mythology.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Some of the humour and sequences are a bit off, but make no mistake, this is the most powerful Star Wars film ever made. The Last Jedi has some of the most epic moments and lore in the sagas history, coupled with amazing camera shots, an exciting plot, and the best character development it's ever seen in Ben and Rey. This is a very different Star Wars, and many fans will feel negatively towards it it; but there's no denying we begged Rian Johnson to take risks. The Last Jedi will stand alone as one of the most unique and memorable films in the saga and I only have praise for this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There seems to be a large portion of the "old fans club" who don't seem to want to see anything new. And there's nothing wrong with disliking the film, but to pour the same amount of vitriol that I see in these reviews is just childish.<br/>It's literally the reason I made this account. (Hello, by the way)<br/>And for reference, I too grew up with Star Wars, actually learnt English from it, played all the games and watched the series. I'm a fanboy too.<br/><br/>The film uses many plot twists and subverts the traditional "hero with an unlikely plan saves the day because he's the hero dammit" trope and is actually realistic about losses and such. Making realistic strategy work and the emphasis on sacrifice refreshes the action scenes leaves anticipation as to what will happen next and who will survive.<br/>Some scenes in particular just mesmerised the whole theatre, the set design, animation, choreography and general aesthetic of the whole film is just beautiful.<br/>Also, Kylo Ren is probably the best character from this trilogy, most certainly better than any prequel arcs.<br/><br/>There's no such thing as a perfect film, but this film does enough right to merit the high score,<br/>I'd say its biggest flaw is probably the set up for Luke, I disagree that he would run away like that (not a spoiler, seen in the previous film), however, I enjoyed how the film continued his story at the end. Ditto Admiral  Holdo, both could have been handled better but I liked how their characters evolved.<br/><br/>I can't do 9.5 so I'm rounding it to ten. Equal to a New Hope, not as good as TESB.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The Last Jedi is better than The Force Awakens, but is only just better than the Prequel Trilogy.<br/>Which is shameful.<br/><br/>I mean how creatively dead are the writers of Hollywood that they basically have to rip off the Original Trilogy.<br/>Again.<br/>But it doesn't totally steal from The Empire Strikes Back - It does the same plot, in reverse.<br/><br/>The fact that the writers cannot come up with better factions than the Empire and Rebels despite the fact that even with seemingly infinite resources and manpower the First Order cannot seem to crush a ragtag group.<br/>Not even America had this much trouble in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Frankly the CGI also was a bit of a mess. Watching this in VUE's usual quality really brings to the fore that modern technology is simply reaching the point where the Uncanny Valley effect begins to take effect.<br/><br/>The Characters themselves were largely a disappointment as well. The star of the movie was General Hux, played by Domhnall Gleeson, in that his character not only goes through an arc but also take his role in the movie seriously. The addition of constant quips and jokes from the cast, apart from those on the Antagonists, is really jarring - Let Marvel movies stick with the machine gun gags.<br/>Once again Rey is a flat, unlikable main characters, but at least she has improved since TFA. Finn and Poe have lost their charm because they almost feel like the exact same character over the 2 films - they are static in a changing world.<br/>Kylo Ren is good, though only towards the second part of the movie. Which is a shame because of Adam Driver's strong acting in TFA.<br/>Phasma is being pushed for being this Nu-Era's Boba Fett but has none of the charisma, or screen time, to pull it off.<br/><br/>This movie has zero ambition and frankly i was not alone in the theatre bored and mockingly amused at this production. It is such a shame what this wonderful IP has become - but that is what happens when you play it safe with a bunch of executive suits running the show, for maximum profit of course<br/><br/>3/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Also, Kylo was turned by Snoke although he was studying with Luke? How and when?<br/>BB8 - a droid - controlling walkers? Why not make it fly the Falcon next?<br/>As for the characters who are just killed off or play no real part.. they are just there for no reason but to sell toys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

What should have been incredibly tense action is undermined by a tone straight out of an animated Disney film (save the cute animals!). Characters that started out fairly interesting or at least with potential in ep.7, like Finn, fall completely flat in this one. Plot lines, imagery and even dialogue are copied/pasted straight out of the original trilogy. Everything feels forced, and imbued with a corporate blandness. There are constant, pointless "plot twists", and as a bonus, everything you knew and loved from Star Wars gets thrown out the window.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

How anyone can give it anything above a 5 speaks volumes to how there will never be a short supply of idiots. The treatment of Luke and his legacy is shameful. People dare to say it's good for being bold. Being bold for the sake of being bold is good? REALLY? Then why isn't Donald Trump the most popular politicain in history? This movie is indefensible. Those who do it are part of the problem. Disney has killed this franchise. Between this travesty of a movie and the recent mistreatment of Star Wars by EA, this franchise is on its way out. Millions of fans cried out in terror. And were suddenly silent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Finn, the male lead of the movie, was sidelined to hell and back. I love SW more than anything but I won't be paying for another SW movie directed by Rian Johnson. I had been counting down the days to TLJ for months but watching it was depressing. I watched it again today to be sure about how I really felt about it and it just drained me.

Rian Johnson is a good director, but he somehow dropped the ball here. The B-plot in this movie is poorly written and honestly even poorly acted (Kelly Marie Tran feels like a television actress). The whole thing feels pointless. Another issue is how they really don't do much with Luke Skywalker. Aside from making his character contradictory to how he was in the original trilogy, his arc in this film just isn't compelling.

It had some great moments but overall I thought crucial scenes just happened without any motivation. In the end I didn’t really care much. The characters were mostly just shells to spit out lines and you could tell that the actors weren't believing their lines. The two best performances were by Adam Driver, although I get sick of his temper tantrums, and Mark Hamill, whose Luke Skywalker is just chewed up and spit out with a heavy dose of cynicism and misery. I was ready to leave when it was over.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7854261"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I'll start my review by saying that in my opinion I feel like most of the more viscerally negative reactions to the movie are because it's a Star Wars movie, specifically the direct sequel to the widely successful and loved Episode 7 and spiritual successor to the most beloved Star Wars to this point Empire. Despite the fact that my inner nerd took exception to a lot of decisions in this movie, the really cool scenes are on par with some of the best and most iconic scenes in the franchise, and as a whole I enjoyed it more than I didn't. I honestly feel like if not for Episode VII and really liking the story/character threads that it started to sew, I'd like this movie a lot more.<br/><br/>There seemed to be a lot of hubbub about how much Episode VII seemed to mirror Episode IV. It's a fair criticism but I personally enjoyed that aspect of it. This movie feels like when they first started working on it they would continue to acknowledge a similar progression mirroring certain plot points of the original trilogy while gearing the future of the franchise toward the new characters. The first act will make you feel right at home if you're a fan of the original trilogy as the movie starts out pretty strong. Toward the end of the first act leading into the second though it feels almost as if Rian got cold feet based on the aforementioned "hubbub" .I feel like they spent the rest of the movie doing one of two things: 1. Rushing through the Empire and even Jedi callbacks through so they could move on from the comparisons and 2. Completely dismissing a lot of potentially interesting plot points and mysteries from Episode VII.<br/><br/>Mystery behind Snoke and who he is exactly? Dead. Rushed through the mirroring to the ending of Empire to essentially get it, despite a kick ass fight scene afterward. Finn's character arc (and placement as a co-star really) seems to get completely rebooted in favor of having him go through it again via some whacky side adventure that ultimately means nothing. Kylo torn on which "side of the force" he should be on, something that's touched on multiple times in the first act? Now the new supreme leader, tossing aside the Vader character arc hinted at through the first movie and a half. Toss in the fact that after one or two short training sessions with Luke that suddenly Rey's a pro with the force as opposed to Luke's amateurish familiarity with it after training with Yoda, and the tease that you might see Luke raise his again crashed-in-the-water X-Wing never shown on screen and there are so many missed opportunities.<br/><br/>Toss in a half baked spy/code cracker character with a really bizarre stuttering problem making points about the ethics about either side of a war that never goes anywhere and is negated by how **** the First Order is shown to repeatedly be, a blooming Finn/Rey chemistry that's been building for the better part of two movies that looks like it's suddenly tossed aside at the end with Poe Dameron suavely introducing himself to Rey just in time before the movie ends, Leia becoming some sort of space ghost jedi rather than using this as an opportunity to give Carrie Fisher the send off she deserves and Luke Skywalker coming up with a brilliant plan to stall Kylo Ren at the end without actually giving him the satisfaction of killing him only to die anyways, and this movie turns from a solid popcorn flick into a little bit of a conflicted mess that leaves me thinking this movie could've been so much more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Almost every story question, curiosity, or interesting character was just reduced to an insulting two and a half hour middle finger. I don't know what movie the critics were watching... I will list only a few of the many problems I have with this movie. SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>1) Leia just randomly having force powers, being able to survive the vacuum of space, and just pulling herself back into the ship. No. No, no, no, no, no. This just seems like a writer that was too uneducated to know which Skywalker had training in the force, and then just rolled with it. It wasn't awe-inspiring. It wasn't creative. It wasn't a "risk". It was just bad. 2) Rey is now a character that many, including myself, just do not care about anymore, or at the very least find less interesting. WHY would you make her a nobody? The entire Star Wars story (movies) has been based around the Skywalker family. You have other powerful force-sensitive families that she could have come from. You have characters from games/novelizations... ANYTHING! But now we have no background... no interesting lineage... just this random person that is now able to compete with a Skywalker. 3) The comedy. Why are you trying to make Star Wars into some Marvel-esque superhero comedy? You set this film up to be a battle of light and darkness. The stage was set for battle, tension, intrigue, and war. Instead... we got forced, out of place comedy, random shirtless Kylo Ren, and some awkward milking scene... 4) I have no desire to see the next episode. And I don't mean this in a "I'm boycotting the franchise because my fan theory didn't come true" way. What I mean is, this is the first time in the entirety of my love of Star Wars that I have no desire to see the next film, because every character progression or fate that I would normally care about, I just don't. That care, that wonder, that curiosity... it is just gone. I have no interest to see where these characters go, because to me they are insultingly ruined through poor writing, and destructive regression. That is how badly the writer/director has mutilated this film. I hope that this film hits Disney where it hurts, their bank accounts. Of course, it is Star Wars, people will want to see it. But, I have already started warning friends to just wait to see it when it becomes free to stream from a service like Amazon Prime. Paying to see this trash is the only further insult that can be done to many Star Wars fans. A disappointment, to be sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The crystal foxes were about the only new thing in this last film. Walt Disney are being very lazy and really just milking the brand.<br/><br/>I.e. ‘we are losing all our ships’. What. Useless bit of narrative that is. I can see you are losing all the ships. This telling what was going on happened over, and over, and over again. Film is a visual medium ‘SHOW DONT TELL. Daisy Ridley doesn’t have an acting bone in her body. Performances by her just make me and most of the people I went to the film with CRINGE.<br/><br/>POOR SCRIPTING, POOR STORY AND POOR ACTING GET IT A 2 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>GIVE THE FRANCHISE BACK TO GEORGE LUCAS - IT IS NOT SAFE IN WALT DISNEY’S HANDS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It exceeded my expectations in that regard, of course. A formulaic, boring, insulting - those are the words that come to mind. In this world of heroes, or, as movie puts it, 'legends', none of the characters of the episodes 6 and 7 feel like they earned their place, power or recognition. This is now the world of Mary Sues and fan fiction level of writing.<br/><br/>The movie is all over the place - from cast, in which I can only remember Mark Hamill for his outstanding work (as ever), to character development, to forced jokes almost every five minutes and petty attempts at pathos, to story delivery, which, I must note, feels disjointed, weak and sometimes not fit for a feature-length movie. Speaking of which, it was obvious for me and my friend sitting beside me from very early on that the story, with the ammount of characters and sub-plots going on, would look far better if it was series - it was that hard to follow all these characters and their irrelevant struggles, which, by the way, weren't able to convience me to empathise with them.<br/><br/>I said above that this is now the world of Mary Sues. Nothing characters achieve is earned. It is all given to them by the all-powerful will of writers that seem onlyto be bothered by pleasing the lowest possible common denominator, which, of course, will repay their, ahem, hard work a thousand times over. The only meaningful sacrifice in the whole movie, and fatal at that, was made by, you guessed it, Luke. Of course, as with the rest of the movie and it's contrived plot twists, this sacrifice wasn't without a 'that was not expected, in a bad way' moment. But to understand what I mean by that, you'll have to watch the movie, which I absolutely can not recomend if you have any respect to the universe of Star Wars. I can hardly find a few good words to say about this movie, but there some to be said. Except I won't - so bitter is the aftertaste. Okay, okay, the effects were nice, however, that's all I can say about them - there were a plenty of hiccups. But is it enough to give this movie more than, say, 5 (as it is the average user rating at the moment of writing this)?<br/><br/>To sum it up, it's not a movie for a Star Wars fan, as you might have guessed already. It's a cash grab, and I regret every penny I paid for a ticket. Sadly, these was no refund.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

While not perfect, it had me on the edge of my seat... I've never had a movie/theater experience like this before - I didn't know what was going to happen next. I can understand and respect why some would not like this movie. I used to be a die hard Star Wars fan who obsessed about lore details. As an adult I care more about moment to moment impact, emotion, humor, and surprise/wonder.. This movie surprised and moved me multiple times. (Spoiler) It feels like the movie and series are breaking from the tired old usual mold of Good vs. Evil, and into something different. We already had that story arc with episodes 1-6. (Jedi vs Sith, Empire vs Rebellion) To phrase what Luke said (in the trailers) it's time for the Jedi to end..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The directing is top notch with great pacing and good acting, so I'm dumbfounded by how much hate there is within the USER SCORES because it's so much better than TFA. For myself.. TLJ is the 3rd best Star Wars film after ANH and even then it's almost on par with it. It really was enjoyable and I wasn't bored at any point like I was with TFA.<br/><br/>Now for one scene which a lot of people are complaining about... Injured and unconscious Leia floating in space and then she wakes up to self rescues by launching herself towards the safety of a ship. It was a magical moment like a Superman moment. People seem to think that was farfetched... No it isn't, it should be common knowledge that Leia has force potential equal to her brother but has never really used it, until now. So calm down!!<br/><br/>Okay, now among other complaints like dumb convenient situations... Uhm that is in all Star Wars movies... It's no excuse to dislike this or any Star Wars film especially when you call yourself a fan of the original trilogy, like so many unhappy reviewers have been stating.<br/><br/>Luke Skywalker dying... why not? He over exerted himself with an insane feat. Don't worry people, Jedi like Luke are even more powerful when they ascend. It won't be the last we see of him.<br/><br/>I scored this movie a 10 to level out the unfair scores people have been giving out. It's a 9 really. Let go of the hate and you will like TLJ.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

TFA was too close to the originals and the fans hated it, now TLJ is too far and they hate it. There's no winning. Honestly my rating is a 8.8/9, but someone needs to offset all the 0's. Could have used a little less humor, let us live a little more in the emotion of the moment. That being said at least the jokes worked. SW has always been a little cheesy, and that's okay, but in my opinion they slightly cheapened the maturity of this entry. I liked the movement away from the black and white morality of the series, towards something more real and adult. This is a Star Wars film that's finally willing to acknowledge the grey areas, and I think the series is better for it. Yeah, there are still a lot of toy commercials in this, but it's SW, what do you expect?<br/><br/>All the things you want from the series are here. Space battles, ground battles, adventure, excitement, heroes and villains. The spectacle of it all is amazing, if not a little overlong. The saber duals featured here are by far the best choreography the series has ever seen. No spoilers, but about 2/3 of the way through is a sequence that I don't think Lucas could have conceived on his best day. These expected moments are solid, but what this film really has going for it is when it steps away from those expectations. To start with there's actual character development, believable and relatable character growth! TLJ features some of the most nuanced people I've seen in a major studio franchise film. Finn could have used a little more to work with, but his B-story is still fun, and has some payoff for the future of the series. What always made Han so great was that he felt like a real person dropped into this fantastic world. His presence is missed, but Rey and Kylo make up for this in spades.<br/><br/>This finally feels like a new direction for the series, and as someone who grew up with the original trilogy, I'm happy to move beyond the characters that shaped my childhood. Those characters are still here, and feel so much more real than they ever have before. You can feel the weight of 30 years of war on all of them, especially when you look in Luke's eyes. Life seldom turns out the way you expect it to, and this movie acknowledges that. I think this sentiment is the exact reason so many have trouble with the film, they want a simple story of good versus evil. They want the heroes that they know and love to be challenged, but they also want it to be safe. This movie is not safe. It wants you to see beyond the space opera conflict. To see that the universe is larger than Rebels and Empires. It wants to break the cycle and become something more. I applaud the audacity of this, and enjoyed every moment in the theatre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

So many things wrong with this movie which makes me worried for the future of the franchise with the countless spin offs and yet another trilogy on the way.<br/><br/>Cons: -CGI in some places was terrible, they managed to make this film look worse than TFA and RO. Some very dodgy looking scenes and the animals on the casino planet looked shoddy. -Acting was less than impressive (although Adam Driver and Mark Hamill were great).<br/>-Luke, who faced both Vader and Palpatine and managed to sway Vader back into the light side, was scared of Kylo Ren, who had not even gone to the dark side yet, and, for a brief moment, tried to kill him. Completely out of character. -Princess Leia flying through space (no explanation needed).<br/>-The whole Finn and Rose sub plot was not needed, boring and bad. It slowed the film down considerably, was completely pointless in the end, introduced DJ (who was incredibly irritating IMO), 5 minutes talking about how cruel the animals were treated (why is this needed) and were conveniently thrown into prison with a hacker. -Snoke, who in TFA was made out to be this all powerful Sith Master, is killed off halfway through. No explanation to his backstory, who he was, how he came to power. -Poe stalling Hux at the start. Again, no explanation needed. -Captian Phasma, like in TFA, literally does nothing in this film and, even worse, is killed. Probably had about 10 minutes screen time in both movies combined. -Comic relief/cringey 'jokes' every 5 minutes.<br/>-Unanswered questions from TFA. How was Anakin's/Luke's lightsaber found? What's happened to the Knights of Ren?<br/>-Poe and Finn, although my favourite characters from TFA, fell flat in this movie.<br/>-Luke dying.<br/>-BB8<br/>-Pogrs.<br/>(I would mention Rey's parents basically being nobodies, but I don't think we've got the actual answer to that yet).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Kylo Ren was the most interesting character by far. Adam Driver was excellent.<br/>-Some cool visuals - e.g when the Supremacy gets blown up. -Luke vs Kylo scene.<br/>-Yoda.<br/>-Enjoyed the training of Rey and Luke.<br/>-Thought Daisy Ridley was good, still think Rey is a good and interesting character.<br/>-Kylo Ren + Rey v Snoke's bodyguards.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

All of them had potential.<br/>Yet it was all turned in favor of doing a Marvel movie in the Star Wars universe. A good laugh here and there is okay, but this movie puts too much emphasis on bringing up laughs.<br/><br/>I loved some of the lines from Luke. The were the sound of the fans - the past Jedis did lots of things wrong and that's what finally broke him. Yet he was out of character at least two or three times.<br/><br/>Poe was a puppy held in a cage. Lots of noise and movement, but in the end - none of effect. Finn could be completely cut out of the movie and it wouldn't change a thing.<br/><br/>Leia had her scenes and one in particular should've been her last. That would be so much more both for her and Kylo. Yet they went with Superman style. Foolish.<br/><br/>Hux is a joke in this movie and I reckon that's on purpose.<br/><br/>While this one was not able to deliver the same thing that "Empire strikes back" did, it copied some of it, while also borrowing from "Return of the Jedi", yet lacking it's depth.<br/><br/>Kylo Ren is not and will never be the next Vader. Adam Driver tries hard, but all that is being written for his character makes it impossible.<br/><br/>Snoke was put to waste in the movie.<br/><br/>The FO and Resistance chase was absurd, and I mean absurd while looking at all SW movies and the final fight was just so plain and simple, it irritated me.<br/><br/>I feel a bit broken by this movie, as I see where Disney wants to go with it. "Kill the past", as Kylo states it, is Disney's plan. Cut the ties with the previous installments. That is "a" strategy.<br/><br/>I find it a broken one, as it could've built a new cult based on the old movies, sparkled with a fresh look, yet it killed both.<br/><br/>To sum up, two quotes:<br/>- Mark Hamill on his role in TLD: "When I read 8, I told Rian [Johnson, the writer-director], 'I fundamentally disagree with virtually everything you've decided about my character'," Hamill said during an ABC interview.<br/>- "This is not going to go the way you think." I concur. Sadly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
