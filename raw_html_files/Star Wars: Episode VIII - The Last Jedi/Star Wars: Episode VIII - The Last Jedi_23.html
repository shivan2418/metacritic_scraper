Some more specific comments:  1)  Did not like how Luke was portrayed in the Luke/Kylo Ren backstory.  Seemed out of character. 2)  Leia space scene was really strange and immediately induced a cringe.  Probably should have let her story end just before this.  3)  The light speed-ram scene was kind of cool, but my first thought was, "Wow, why didn't anyone do this against the death star!"  4)  The filmmakers seemed to go out of the way to NOT give the audience what was expected.  Surprise is fine, but with a movie like this, that's connected to lots of other stories, you still need to give the audience a bit of what they want (so maybe do it in an unexpected way).  For example, killing Snoke is fine, but give us SOMETHING about his background.  Also, no reason not to let Luke be a bit more of a jedi master, which I think many wanted to see.  There's lots more of this.  Almost felt like the filmmakers were being vindictive to more involved fans. 5)  The acting was good, the score was great, and some of the visuals were fantastic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Too many script's twists, some grotesque scenes, and the powers shown here by the Jedi (worthy in some cases of the Dragon Ball's Saiyans), added to an array of nonsense such as adding multiple story threads that do not fit, in poorly mounted sequences, just to give a reason to appear to the secondary characters, taking you completely out of the movie. From now on, script writers can take any easy way out they need without caring about rules and plausability.<br/><br/>Subtlety in humor is gone forever, adding easy gags in almost every scene, some remembering Leslie Nielsen's films, or parodies like Space Balls. Mel Brooks could have directed this movie. These references are not necessarily bad, but not in the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>Some positive reviews stated this movie is innovative, well... they literally copied one scene from "The Return of the Jedi" and the dialogue lines in another one. Episode 7 remembered Episode 4 in a much less explicit way.<br/><br/>Star Wars has moved to an even farther galaxy for most of its audience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I've read a lot of positive reviews and if I hear one more time "A bold new direction", I'm jumping off a cliff.  That's just another way of saying, "We took everything what the movie should have been, threw it in the garbage, brainstormed a bunch of awful ideas and ran with it.   Hey, thats real bold.  Thats what the movie should be called, Star Wars: A Bold New Direction, into the universe of garbage.  Also, I don't have a problem with female leads,  its that they were weak female leads, all teary eyed, lets run away, have faith.  They're supposed to take on the Darkside?!   If Vader was still around he'd a boarded  that ship and lay waste to everyone.  Rose to Finn, "We win by saving the people we love". No you don't!  You win by blowing sh*t up. Oh man, the more I think about the movie the angrier I get.  When I was kid I was afraid of Vader and even at 40 when Vader laid the smack down in Rogue One I got a little scared.  Who's afraid of Kylo Ren?  Snoke, who the hell was he?  There's no evil.  Actually there is, its the movie itself.  So insanely bad it destroyed the hope of every Star Wars fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

How can that become a cause by fighting via virtual reality..lol? It's better if Luke actually showed up, kicked some First Order butt and then became a sacrifice, ergo uniting everyone and doing the right thing. Man, that would have been such a powerful scene and all could be forgiven (maybe).<br/><br/>Comedy scenes included are absurd (comedy is good to have but not this way) and take away the sense of urgency and importance of the fight too much, characters are shallow and cliche, enough plot holes to fill every hole on a golf course, and severe deus ex machina (the Force mostly) used for convenience and lazy/bad writing.<br/><br/>Men in this movie are portrayed as idiots or macho. Women are not well represented or respected either and does them a disservice. The people who funded (Disney), wrote and directed this movie must have no morality or clue, therefore the movie had none.  I was giving it a 6/10 (probably from shock) but more I dwell on these things, it's more like a 1/10. Bad movie but terrible Star Wars.﻿</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Every male character is whiny, stupid, egotistic, immature, irrational, or make the wrong decisions or not to be trusted. And guess what, the “new” Luke Skywalker has some of them traits too! The leaders in this movie are female, the protagonist an over-powered female (with little training). The people making sacrifices to save everyone? Overwhelmingly female apart from one character. And most are infallible.  The days when men saved women? The roles are well and truly reversed in this movie. Not to mention the diversity, interracial relationships just for the sake of it (and also does not add to the movie), and the only joke when it came to racial issues was at the expense of white red headed male character when mentioning his “pasty" skin tone. It was comical to see Chewbacca becoming conscious of being a meat eater (but not in the way they intended), and Luke Skywalker disgustingly milking a sea cow (there was absolutely no point in this). This is supposed be a galaxy far away, and yet you’re reminded of the war-profiteering and rich people being evil. Having animal rights issues thrown in there and a war general being a female with purple dyed purple hair and looks like she teaches gender studies. And we’re all set. The only thing I wasn’t surprised at was that Luke Skywalker didn’t come out as transgender or wasn’t accused by Kylo ren as being a “white male” as an insult. Oh and did I mention that white people are evil? For what it’s worth, I enjoyed it. The visuals are well and truly beautiful, and the action sequences are great. However, had it not had that, I don’t know what score I would have given it, because the writer is so politically driven with Feminism, Diversity, and anti-white male bias. The focus is lost. Lost that is, on telling a remarkable story that makes sense and doesn’t contain more plot holes than Swiss cheese.  The character development is so bad that you simply do not care about any of the characters. Characters come and go, and you wonder not only who they are, but you don’t care either. Disney tried so hard to wipe the slate clean that even the Characters blatantly tell us to forget the past on BOTH sides of the war. Luckily, I’m not a huge Star Wars fan and I found some parts amusing that I shouldn’t. Something happens with Princess Leia that made some people including myself in the cinema laugh. Like wtf is going on here moment? otherwise I’d be completely gutted. Because what made Star Wars great, like the Jedi, the Luke Skywalker of old etc is not in this movie.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It's hard to write a review that doesn't include spoilers. But hey, If you ARE a Star Wars fan and want to be spoiled? You can't do any worse than actually watching this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Decisions need to be earned or explained. Say what you want about the prequels, they had a lot of problems, but the overall story made sense. The Last Jedi's main plot is the worst Star Wars story ever told. It wouldn't even make a bad Clone Wars episode. At least 30 minutes of this movie is dedicated to a weird, useless subplot. In a 2h30min, this time would've been better invested in making characters richer and deeper and taking the time to investigate their motivations.<br/><br/>Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is the only redeeming factor in this movie and the only main character who's motivations make sense.<br/><br/>All and all, this isn't a terrible movie. It's a fun movie with bad lazy writing. Star Wars deserves better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It has a lot of plot problems (a couple of ridiculous scenes like the one with Leia flying in space, the Rey and Kylo seaing each other because Snoke connected their minds, the unnescesary Finn and Rose subplot, the death of Snoke) and felt it very long. The performances are very good (especially Mark Hammil and the beautiful Daisy Ridley), the action scenes are excellent (the first 10 minutes have no waste) and the CGI as always perfect. The "forced" humor they criticize so much, I did not feel it at all. I really liked some of the twists, makes the movie unpredictable. Even do, I think there were many flaws in the script, so it's a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

All that mattered was that a woman named Leia met a man named Han and they had a child named Ben. That is it. Everything that the characters fought for in 1-6 is blown up in a matter of seconds in episode 7. And there is no reverse course here in episode 8 - it doubles down. To accept these new films as sequels is to accept that. You can't have it both ways.<br/><br/>I'm not whining. It's simply a fact. And it's bad story-telling to suggest in the 7th chapter of a 9 part saga that what happened in 1-6 is not relevant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie differs so much in tone, is so sprawling, and at least in the case of one plotline is completely unoriginal.  If you're going to steal a plotline, at least do what Abrams did in Episode VII and steal a previous Star Wars plotline.  The jarring changes in tone, even within scenes, is off-putting to say the least.  The arbitrariness behind how the director, producer, and writers discarded what was built in Ep VII is worthy of pause.  It's clear they want to take the series in a new direction, but the casualness with which they are discarding tradition and story is mind-boggling.  Even putting all that aside, the viewer will be frequently lost as the film bounces around from one scene to the next, wondering if anything of significance will finally move the story forward.<br/><br/>Wait for the Blu-Ray, if you insist on watching.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is a terrible Star Wars movie and a good Scifi movie.  I personally haven't followed any other scifi franchises for thirty years.  Disney is missing the boat and losing the Star Wars magic.  I explained to my nephew in a way he could understand.  Think if Spiderman was infected with Venom "DarkSide" and Captain America chose to kill him in his sleep.  Now think if Spiderman was his young nephew.  Now think if Spiderman was Captain America's twin sister's child and the only family he has.  That is what this movie chose for Star Wars.  Skywalker risked everything for family.  It is a well established character arc.  Even his evil father renounced the Dark Side for family.  Now he is willing to murder a child in his sleep that his twin sister has asked him to protect.  Just for LS to think about that is too much of a stretch.  This type of decision from Lucasfilm storymakers are represented throughout the film.  Terrible SW Movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

On its own this movie is badly paced and suffers from some glaring plot holes that canonically damage the Star Wars brand, at worst it destroys the character of previous characters and removes any desire to continue the lore.<br/><br/>On a positive note the acting is solid with great choreography and even when the scenes do not hold up the emotion always comes through.  The movie looks gorgeous despite some interesting costume choices, the sets and visuals of this movie are simply stunning, never has Star wars looked so good and smelt so bad.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams will return to the director's chair for the final instalment in the current trilogy, but most of that effort will now be required to steer this sinking ship back on course.  Any hope was lost immediately when moments that have been building for 30+ years are quickly dismissed for comedic relief.  Questions are either left unanswered or are given very unsatisfactory resolutions that will leave a bitter taste in your mouth.<br/><br/>As an admitted hyper-fan of the franchise (I even have a signed Luke Blue lighsaber in my office) I can reluctantly be open to change when it makes sense within the lore, but some of the actions in this movie (light speed attack) make decisions made in the original trilogy look stupid and lessen the struggles undertaken by the heros.<br/><br/>In short do not see this movie if you are a SW fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

If you are a superfan looking for a deep-dive coda built on the foundations of 20th-century storytelling (i.e "the past"), you'll probably be disappointed and join in with multitude of negative, self-flagellating, mourning user reviews. But, if you a looking for an updated foundation for storytelling in the 21st-century, with fresh takes on heroes and villains, with some measure of ambiguity about who is which, then you should really enjoy this movie. Personally, I enjoyed the challenge of this story. My expectations were not always met in scene after scene. But there is so much now to build on in future installments. Remember how you used to love going to Sears stores back in the 1970s? They were full of cool things to see (Pong video games! Overstuffed plaid couches! Dishwashers with clear doors! Toughskins jeans!!). Well, nowadays you can sit at your desk and peruse through everything your heart might desire on Amazon, WalMart, or any one of hundreds of Websites. Which shopping experience do you prefer? Everything points to the fact that most Americans strongly prefer 21st-century Internet shopping to the 20th-century bricks-and-mortar experience. You wistfully wish for the past and the hustle and bustle of in-person shopping; you lament its passing. But then you fire up your iPhone and buy from the Internet retailers anyway. IMHO, that's whats going on with the newest episodes of Star Wars. Once you give them a chance and see the new storytelling twists and turns, you will see that it really is better now. The past was precious, but it is now in the past. Progress is good. And so is this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

My husband and I both disliked this movie, it felt like a waste of time.  After the movie, my husband asked what was the point of the movie, I couldn't think of one.  I wasn't moved by any of the actors, and what was tolerable when I watched Star Wars in my teens, became unbearable this time.  It is sad that they try the same old formulation that barely worked back in the 70's, and movies today, run circles around this piece of trash.  I can't believe the reviewers gave it such high mark, WTF.  Makes me less likely to trust reviewers, less likely to go to the movies.  I too just created an account to write this review, too bad it wasn't a good review.

This movie is gorgeous.  I really mean drop dead, omg, praise jeebus gorgeous.  The sets are amazing, the effects are stellar, and the musical score really sets the mood.<br/><br/>It's a very shiny veneer to cover up the dog **** plot.  Whoever wrote this needs to have his writing card revoked.  Seriously.  Most of the plot revolves around an 18 hour stand off by which two *space ships* are trying to catch the other.  The rebels are trying to flee, the order is trying to catch.  They can both see each other but neither can really do more than spout platitudes.  Why is it like this?  Why can't one ship simply burn a bit more fuel to catch up?  Why can't they hyperspace one ship ahead and set up some kind of pincer attack on the rebels?  **** you that's why.  The rest of the plot is patently idiotic as well.  Rey and Luke kumbayaing on some distant planet but never really accomplishing anything.  Finn and some diversity hire going to a casino to *save the animals man* and wasting everyone's time.  I had high hopes for Kylo Ren to.  After the first movie I was one of the few that really liked Adam Driver and his portrayal of Ren as a tortured soul sort of juvenile sith/jedi.  In this one they just decided to make him a whiny brat.  I was even more disappointed in Rey.  Gone is the optimist fun loving, bright eyed Rey from the first movie.  Instead we get yet another mewling and crying Katniss character to act as the *strong female lead*.  I'ma close with one last criticism.  Leia flies in space.  Yes, superman flying in space.  That happens.  They had myriad ways to let Carrie Fisher die a dignified death during this cluster**** of a movie, but instead they choose to have her fly around in space.  Rian Johnson, please, for the love of god, go back to shooting indie films with your boy JGL and leave the big budget stuff to people who respect the canon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I saw this movie on saturday. I came out of the cinema feeling conflicted. Last Jedi continues Rey's personal journey towards becoming a jedi, sheds light on Kylo Ren's past, and shows the resistances continuing plight against the war machine of the first order. Unfortunately the way the movie does this, does not sit well with me. The movie is too enamored at pulling the rug out from under viewers expectations. It is one continuing sequence of plot twists and turns, most of the time for no particularly good reason. By doing this too much, it manages to undermine the emotional value of its characters and action. Most of the time I don't feel like cheering for the heroes, or being excited about what happens to them next, since they are mostly unlikeable and unrelatable. For example Laura Dern's character comes out of nowhere and establishes herself as unlikeable with the first words that come out of her mouth, so I am not at all interested in her ultimate fate despite it being a major event. Somebody might be excited by the terrific visual effects, but I'm not, especially since the whole fleet chase is utterly ridiculous in its unbelievability. The movie also has several utterly wasted and shallow characters and scenes that fall flat. Such as poor Phasma, who could have been entirely cut from the movie and nobody would have noticed. Benicio Del Toro's character is nothing but a shallow plot device, and his screentime can be calculated in seconds. He also has no redeeming qualities that would make us root for him. He comes, does his plot thing, and leaves. We forget him instantly. The porgs are more annoying than funny, and I'm not a fan of the ham-fisted vegan message of Chewbacca scene. There is also too much negativity in the movie to make it really feel 'heroic' or 'epic'. Everything the main characters do, is failure in one form or another. This, coupled with the director's pathological need of surprising the viewers, is not really enjoyable to watch, sorry.  Yes, this follows the SW formula of trilogies, where the middle chapter puts the heroes through their darkest times, but too much is too much. There is simply not enough to like about the movie. Speaking of failures, the worst crime the movie commits is not telling the story of Luke Skywalker. By this I mean the events that happened between return of the Jedi and this film. You'd imagine that after fans waited 30 years for Luke to kick ass as a Jedi master, we would be treated to at least some. I am not opposed to what happened to Luke in this movie. The scenes were cool and appropriate. The problem are the things that remained untold, because Luke's entire life after destruction of the first death star appears to be a failure. I guess it maintains with the movies ultimate downer theme.  The one thing that does work in this movie, is Rey and Kylo and everything related to them. Kylo Ren's story and his interaction with Rey is very interesting and I look forward to seeing what happens to them next. However Rey and Kylo remain almost entirely detached from the rest of the movie. You could have removed Kylo and Rey from the movie and everything between resistance and first order would have still happened. The whole movie is fragmented in this way and I don't like it. Kylo and Rey story are the only positive thing about the movie, so its not a total loss. (However I wish we could've made without the obligatory shirtless scene; which is so predictable now its almost a meme. Thor did it mere weeks before in Thor Ragnarok so its even more blatant)<br/><br/>There is also the thing that Last Jedi continues to copy the original trilogy (particularly empire strikes back) pretty blatantly, unfortunately I can't go into specifics without introducing spoilers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The very first line in the previous movie was "this should begin to put things right" and Episode VII did just that. It was basically a remake, but it restored faith in a series that many had felt lost it's way with the prequels.<br/><br/>If you were to encapsulate this movie in a single line it would be "this isn't going to go how you think" and the movie opens by defying all expectations, where some of the first dialogue is one of our heroes making fun of one of our villains. We're basically picking up from right after where the last movie left us, with the Resistance abandoning their base as they're hunted down by the first order. After an exhilarating space battle, we pick up with Luke and Rey, on a remote island. It's not two seconds since the last movie ended, and once again, your expectations are challenged when Luke Skywalker takes his lightsaber and casually tosses it over his shoulder and goes back to being a hermit, despite Rey's insistence that he train her. The movie continues on like that through all kinds of major twists and turns, which eventually upend much of what was set up in the previous film and leaves us in a spot where we are set up to once again be surprised by whatever is in store for the next installment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Follow him!"<br/><br/>I think that line is what a lot of the haters of this film didn't got. Stop trying to get back to the past and accept the future. This movie is diferent from anything we've seen from this franchise until now. Being the 9° film in a franchise and introducing new concepts is pretty bold. I admired that and i didn't have a problem with any of the new concepts so that helps.<br/><br/>Yep, i've gotta admit this movie is not perfect. Being Star Wars i can easily overlook some minor issues, like two or three lines that don't feel quite right, some underdeveloped characters or del Toro's stupid accent but it's a little difficult to overlook a whole sequence. The Canto Bight part felt kinda prequel-ish to me.<br/><br/>I belive i've never been as enthralled in film as when i first saw The Last Jedi. I don't recall feeling like this with any other film. I couldn't blink afraid to miss something. Every character interaction amazed me and when there was a big revelation i had butterflies in my stomach. This sent shivers down my spine countless times. I was dezzled- and actually, i still am.<br/><br/>On rewatch The Last Jedi is still amazing. Williams' score and Johnson's direction shine even more. This is Johnsson's expression, it's a piece of art. Some of what i felt the first time is lost, of course, that was something special and i hope i can feel that again with Episode XI or another film. Because that is why i watch movies. To feel. And this movie shook every bone in body and made feel through out every scene. This movie reminded me why i watch and love movies and my experience with it was really special.<br/><br/>"God speed, Rebels"</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson has done something for which a LOT of SW fans have been waiting: he took a hard left at viewers' expectations for how a new entry into the saga should look, and I don't think that counts as making a film "bad", let alone ruining an entire saga. Without spoiling any of the surprises "The Last Jedi" beholds, I was excited, surprised, and often giddy as a school child throughout the duration of this movie. It's by no means perfect (very few films are, let alone SW movies), but it takes risks in almost all of the right places. If you take a moment to consider the stories, the developments taking place within the characters (however small or large these may be), and the balance between the film's levity and darkness (or shall I say, "light and dark"? :) ), I think it's evident that Rian Johnson isn't the bumbling moron people are making him out to be. Disliking the turn of events within a film is everybody's right, and if 45% of audiences TRULY disliked these, then so be it. Everyone has a right to their own opinion, but The Last Jedi" is not the technically awful sacrilege many reviewers (and bots) are making it out to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie proves that making PC a priority over writing makes a terrible movie. The good guys are on some sort of constant women/minority kaleidoscope cycle throughout the movie which just feels forced; particularly with the dull writing. Not sure what the PETA thing in the middle of the movie was; both absurd and irritating to me. The pre-Disney Canon has myriad epic tales about 100 times more interesting than this movie; maybe Disney needs to stop being ignorant, and use those to make actually good movies instead of pushing PC liberal socialist agendas in lieu of actual Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It was good for the storytelling aspect of star wars. Because why watch a film knowing whats going to happen? That doesnt sound very fun.

I was obsessed with this series. I played every video game, read every lousy "Expanded Universe" book. I suffered through the prequel trilogy, and the series lost its luster for me quite a bit. Then Disney took over from George Lucas's tired hands, and my childhood returned. The Force Awakens was quite well done, even if it was an overly safe and derivative copy of my original passion. Rogue One was absolutely spectacular in every possible way. But The Last Jedi? Rian Johnson subverted every expectation, and he did it without sacrificing ANYTHING that makes Star Wars what it originally was. People rating this badly were likely the same few who actually enjoyed the prequel drivel. This returned to the original style of simple, tight plots, strong humor, character-driven narratives and action, but at the same time took the story in entirely new directions. Simply the best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back. Disney has returned me to my childhood, 40 years ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I watched 39 minutes of it and exited the theater. Do yourself a favor and either watch "The Room" or "Highlander : The Source". At least you will be entertained by something that's not politicized to a core. There is a constant premise of Female superiority in the movie which ultimately does nothing for the women. The SJW is strong with this one, too! Main characters are like puppets on a string. Nothing relatable. Nothing intellectual. Nothing deep. No suspense. Not a single moment felt realistically StarWars-like. This movie is a raging pile of crap and everyone working on it should feel ashamed for being a part of it. You blew your chance to make Star Wars great again. You bunch of hypocrites and ignorant who care nothing for the consistency, lore and fans. And this is the reason why it will be negative, since you are the cancer of the Star Wars. You are it's Dark Side and there will be time when the Balance will be made anew. Maybe not now. But you will be forgottn, Disney's trilogy of travesty and despair.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Such a relief that many, many others share my sense of disappointment.<br/>To start with, I'm 42. I went to cinema to watch Return of the Jedi when I was 9. I couldn't wait to see Luke Skywalker return from the wilderness to once again kick the Dark side's arse! However It seems that Disney is more interested in promoting the new characters, making Star Wars an advert for toys and cheap laughs. Firstly there are some incredible scenes in this film but not a lot of originality. It seems that a formula has been found. Credit for the casino scene but it didn't really work and felt more like Harry Potter. I was impressed by the realism in Snook's CGI but he came across as not remotely evil and pathetic in turns of a baddie. The irritating Porg birds were cute at first but then became as irritating as Jar Jar Binks and was an obvious ploy for Disney to sell merchandise. Then Luke Skywalker, where do I begin? One moment he's totally against helping Rey but it doesn't take much for him to change his mind. The best moment in the film is when he seems to be totally destroyed and emerges unscathed then follows a Matrix-style duck and an ever-so familiar Ben Kenobi death. I don't think I'll be in the minority of fans who wanted so much to see him kick ass, now it seems he's going to be a harmless ghost? That left me feeling totally deflated. Yes I know he's old now but he's LUKE SKYWALKER for Christ's sake! Surely he is the biggest character in the whole franchise? Many of newcomers will love the new film but for the old fogies like me, it wasn't terrible but left me walking out of cinema wondering why??? And all I can see is dollar signs for Disney.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

For example, one of the most legendary and highly-respected protagonists in cinematic history has been reduced to an uninspiring hermit drinking milk off an alien-cow hybrid as part of his daily routine. Luke deserves better.<br/><br/>Supreme Leader Snoke could potentially be a much sinister villain than Darth Sidious but was unfortunately killed off hastily, Darth Maul-style. Meanwhile, forgettable and insignificant token characters such as Finn and Rose were kept alive all in the name of "multiracial-diversity" and "political-correctness". And don't get me started on the space battles: It was vomit-inducing.<br/><br/>Two-thirds of the movie was built on the premise that the fleeing Resistance cruiser was conveniently placed out of the potent firing range of the entire First Order armada hence the need for the lengthy pursuit. But that clearly raises more questions than answers. Firstly, the entire armada consisted of an estimated 4-5 First Order Star Destroyers including the massive Snoke's personal flagship “Supremacy”, all armed to the teeth with thousands of turbolasers, hundreds of laser batteries, tractor beams, anti-ship torpedoes, and this movie is telling me that none of these sophisticated & powerful destroyers could handle one feeble Resistance cruiser? Unbelievable. Secondly, General Hux could have just deployed his entire squadron of TIE Bombers to strategically target the cruiser's engines and shield generators, decapitating it entirely! Mission accomplished.<br/><br/>The gigantic First Order Dreadnought that is capable of orbital bombardment from space was shockingly vulnerable to "vertical-dropping bombs that defies space physics" from one Resistance bomber.<br/><br/>The "finding the codebreaker at the Casino-Monaco Planet" storyline was grossly unnecessary and a borefest. I understand the writers wanted to further develop the Finn-Rose dynamic but as a longtime fan, it would have been better to allocate the precious screentime to a more-engaging backstory about Snoke or showing more of Rey's Jedi training.<br/><br/>Leia flying around in space without a spacesuit. Apparently being strong in the Force negates the urgent need for oxygen, being frozen, or propelling oneself through a microgravity environment. SpaceX, anyone?<br/><br/>Snoke's death was unreasonably premature.<br/><br/>Luke's death, while expected, could be better managed by the writers.<br/><br/>Kylo-Rey intergalactic Force-Skype communication: The next Tinder in the making?<br/><br/>My Conclusion: A Disney-approved Sci-Fi comedy specially made for the general audience, with Porgs for the kids, while leaving behind the tiny bits of crumbs for the longtime fans to scrimp on.<br/><br/>Hey, as long as Disney makes $2billion at the box office and millions more on merchandise and other related IPs, who are we to criticise them? In the end, it's all business, profits, and nothing else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

At its core its a story about hope.<br/>Things i love; Kylo Rens progression in to one of the best villains in a movie i have seen for a long time. I can't wait to see more of him, Adam Driver was brilliant. Rey and Lukes scenes are excellent, i like how Luke is training her why not to be a Jedi. The space battles and fight chirography are insanely good; especially the scene were Kylo and Rey are fighting Snokes guard together. All the actors are brilliant, direction and cinematography were also awesome. Things i didn't like; Snoke, altough i loved how he met his end (his arrogance basically got him killed) you did't really find out who the hell he was. Phasma was sort of wasted villain as well, i think she needed much more screen time to grow. I think this film is getting to much criticism, Leia has also used the force many times before,  a lot in a few of the books and in the previous films. Its not a stretch of the imagination that instincts took over at the point where she was about to die. I don't think it deserves a 0/10, (i say this a lot on metacritic) if you try hard enough you can find positives in any film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The character development is pretty good for a Star Wars movie! I personally don't want an another Darth Vader, a mute God-like anti-hero if you like. A human with drama, like Kylo Ren, is obviously a different kind of villain, but more relatable. Luke with his own mistakes has also become a mortal and stopped being a "myth". I liked Ren very much, but it was really disappointing to see that just because you have such power, you can just become the strongest Jedi ever existed without a proper training. As for the characters, the only annoying thing was just Ren "development" as a Jedi (not as a hero).<br/><br/>The humor was childish I get it. It was off-putting I get this too and nobody needs to defend the film for it. But we shouldn't act like the mythical original trilogy didn't wear the marks of the 80's film-making era.<br/><br/>Now we have these must-have Disney s**t like the cute creatures (for PR porpuses only) the quotable sentences without any shown depth or the childish humor. But nothing I personally cannot forgive them because it's consistent with the universe. Not the infantile jokes but e.g.: the creatures. It's adding to this world as did the new trilogy anno. The great power of Ren and Kylo is also a modern cliché.  Like in the previous movie: "It's like the Dead Star but bigger!" I was feeling I'm watching a Star Wars movie and I'm glad that the younger generations now also have a "Star Wars experience" too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I didn't really enjoy it and it occurred to me afterwards that the three most prominent male "rebel" characters all either cowards or idiots and all three are shown the error of their ways by wiser and smarter women who are basically in charge of things.  It felt very much like one of those stereotypically sexist sit coms where the Dad is an idiot and has to be told what to do by his clever wife.  Anyway, not very inspiring stuff.  I watched it with a largely male audience and it fell pretty flat.  We all just kind of shuffled out at the end having felt thoroughly lectured.  I mean there was even a bit in the middle which felt like part of educational video about mansplaining as one of the idiot male characters gets told off for being stupid :-(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In fact I still haven't met anyone who liked it... which makes me even more bamboozled by the critic reviews... The user reviews are about right...were the critics watching the same movie we watched? Were they giving a better score because it was Carrie Fisher's last movie?  The movie is filled with a myriad of plot holes, stupid jokes, wasted acting power and long, boring scenes... it does look very pretty, and you feel like you are getting two movies worth for you $$ as it runs so long... but oh boy, what a pity Disney have done this to Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Yes, this movie feels different from other Star Wars movies. And if you tune down your fandom, your despair because all the fan fiction didn't come true, and take a step back and look again with an open mind. you'll find a film that takes a radical and modern look at religion, at Lucas' pathos of family and the "force" and declares a lot of it as the mumbo jumbo it always has been. You cannot have watched the prequels and hope for the Jedi to come back like that. Ever. This film is the beginning of a new rebellion and it rightfully starts with its own in the Star Wars canon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It was so bad, that I simply don't care about the Star Wars universe anymore. There was so much potential wasted. For example, we've been waiting 30 years to see Luke Skywalker again, to see him just be a total jedi badass like vader was at the beginning of Episode 4. But no. We get a cranky old coward who milks aliens and fishes and just runs away for half the movie. We also got the lamest, stupidest space battles that have no bearing on reality. Why do the rebel bombers rely on gravity to pull their bombs down, in space, where there is no gravity? This movie is just such a joke, and wastes the interesting mysteries provided by Episode 7 (which also was bad), which clearly shows there is no one at Disney in charge of the overall story of Star Wars. The whole thing just totally turned me off of Star Wars and left me feeling totally betrayed. Why should I invest in a IP/Franchise/Setting if at any time, the stories I grew up with are all wiped away as no longer canon, only to be replaced with garbage like this? If they did it once, they can do it again at any time. Why give them any more money when they've clearly just given their fans the finger? I'm simply done. Star Wars is dead. Well done Disney.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7938023"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>No. No. No.  This was supposed to be the golden nugget; the Empire Strikes Back of the new franchise.  Suffice it to say, I was disappointed.  All is not lost though, as there were some really good parts.  The scenes between Rey and Kylo are great.  There is a real connection there and both actors are spectacular.  The lightsaber battle in the throne room is unbelievable.  Luke and Leia's characters are also really good and it's great to see them back on screen.<br/><br/>Now the bad news.  The First Order is portrayed to be total idiots.  Hux is a total p*ssy that gets owned at every turn.  In the opening battle they have 3 giant ships and tons of fighters that can't destroy 1 ship.  In the ending battle a ship the size of the moon gets taken down by the ridiculous tactic of simply ramming another ship into it (The Rebellion should just get their hands on 30 or so crappy transports, set course for the nearest Star Destroyer and hit the hyper-drive button.  War over).  Snoke's and Phasma's characters are a total waste.  I get that main characters, and especially supporting characters, often get killed off in big movies to create the shock factor.  But killing off the guy who is supposed to be the ultimate badass, ruler of the empire, shrouded in mystery force-God half way through the movie was a slap in the face.  Snoke is portrayed to be the ultimate puppet master in the Force Awakens.  We finally get to see him in action in Last Jedi only for him to be killed off with no big battle, no explanation and no closure.  The same is true for Phasma.  Who is she? In the 2 films she played in she was totally owned in all her scenes and seems just to be fodder for Disney to sell more toys.  She again confronts her former trooper and gets her ass kicked in seconds and then is dead.  Nothing there.  No development or back-story whatsoever.<br/><br/>On to more bad news.  Did you know this movie is a comedy?  The humor and one-liners in the Last Jedi are too many too count.  While I am all for not making a movie want to cut myself (Yes, you Man of Steel) or bore me to death there is a limit to how many zings you can put into what is supposed to be a serious drama.  The jokes keep running in Last Jedi, mostly at the expense of the First Order.  This serves to undermine their portrayed iron-fist rule over the galaxy.  Moreover, the jokes are misplaced.  I cringed when Rey made a joke about Kylo with his shirt off in what was supposed to be a dramatic force-connected moment.  In the confrontation between Kylo and Luke I was riveted when the two were about confront each other but distracted by the joke when Kylo throws Hex out of his way.  Bottom line is they made it all corny and goofy.<br/><br/>Hollywood sucks at making CGI people and animals.  You think that movie-makers would have learned their lesson after Lucas' Jar-Jar mess but, you would be wrong.  Riding on CGI animals, unnecessary creatures (shameless Disney marketing ploy named Porgs) and Luke milking a CGI Sea Lion are completely useless to the story and made me want to walk out.  Somehow most CGI landscapes can look completely real but the animals look like Doom creatures from 1998.  They suck and snap me out of the fantasy of the movie and back to the reality of the fact that its just a computer made mess.  The whole casino-crashing, riding on ugly donkeys scene was terrible.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are not interesting.  I didn't care about Rose, Finn, the entire command of the Rebellion or anyone not named Kylo Ren in the First Order.  The characters were crap and their story-lines were useless, uninteresting or not emotionally engaging.  The only saving grace was Poe.  Poe wrapped me up right from the start and didn't let go.  He is a wonderfully acted character.  Too bad his scenes are often ruined by the awful Admiral Holdo, played by Laura Dern.  Dern's purple-haired character doesn't blend in with the rest of the characters and feels completely forced.  That, and, she sucks as an actress.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very disappointed in this movie.  Rian Johnson has taken this franchise, which showed so much promise after Abram's Force Awakens, and sent it off the tracks.  His ill-timed use of humor, lack of respect for the characters of the franchise and overuse of CGI (does no one remember Episodes 1-3?) doom this movie.  I would rank it #4 in the lineage of the Star Wars episodes.  If you have seen the first 3 episodes you will know this is not a good thing.<br/><br/>You are still going to go see it no matter what the review says.  I just hope that the next film, directed by Abrams, goes back to the Lucas-style roots.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I had very mixed feelings after watching the film. There were some parts I liked a lot and some parts I very much didn't. In general, I am sad to say that, for me at least the bad outweighed the good. I enjoyed the the story line with Ray. I liked a lot of the subversion of expectation. I liked to see a diverse group in positions of power in the rebels. Though I enjoyed the expanded universe, ultimately, I am perfectly fine with them diverging from it, they established that they would be doing so with the previous movie. I did not like much of the humor, especially where it derailed the plot and streaked suspension of disbelief. I also feel that the movie's creators mistook the difference between grand and dramatic, with the movie leaning into the territory of overly dramatic. I don't think the tone fits with the original trilogy, or even with the prequels. That is not to say that I feel different is bad, I love change, as long as it fits with and connects to what has been previously established. Finally, I felt many characters were shallow, the action was often a bit too over the top, and any overall message dis-guarded subtlety, coming off a bit heavy handed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It ruined the characters, the lore, space battles, and brought nothing to the table, no interesting characters, no explanations...nothing. One thing it did do was make me like Kylo Ren which i hated in the last movie but thats not enough to save this movie, the fact the this Ryan Johnson is getting his own trilogy is a testament to how much Disney does not care about this franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Allowing that it's built upon countless ideas that came before, this might be the most exquisitely crafted of them all, from its individual moments to its unprecedented thematic strength. Every member of its sprawling cast is written sharp as a knife, many of them making a huge impression despite debuting in this chapter. Even in extremely judicious doses, Rian Johnson manages to find maybe the best ever moments for such mainstays as C-3PO, R2-D2, Chewbacca, and...well, to go on listing might be telling.<br/><br/>The control of tone is assured, veering from some of the funniest beats of a very funny series (don't let anyone tell you otherwise!) to high stakes action and surprisingly intimate drama, without one mode ever compromising another. The story choices are genuinely thrilling, taking us to places you never would have guessed were "allowed," and Johnson continually finds new ways to awe in organically expanding what a Star Wars movie can do.<br/><br/>Some viewers have "cleverly" pointed out that a certain subplot seemingly has no bearing on the rest of the story (the same type who will smugly tell you that Raiders of the Lost Ark didn't "need" Indiana Jones) but I am here to tell you that movies are more than plot, and the character development, thematic exploration and sense of whimsy and adventure in each of the plots is very much worthwhile, and crucial to the overall effect of the film.<br/><br/>This is all building to a finale that hinges on the embrace of myth, storytelling, and inspiration, with an all-time great poignant coda that is nothing less than the story of STAR WARS itself. If they were ever going to stop making these things, the final moments of this film would be the perfect coda to the whole series.<br/><br/>I must admit I am somewhat baffled by the vocal segment of fandom for whom this movie did not work, though I don't doubt the sincerity of their reactions. I won't claim to understand where everyone is coming from (and I'm sure there are many angles both supporters and detractors are coming from) but I imagine some might enjoy it more if they looked at the movie less as the sum of what happens in it and how "good" it is for the characters they love, and gave themselves more fully to how it all happens and what it means.. or perhaps if they were more comfortable laughing along with something and still taking it seriously, or with the movie working to earn awe in ways for which there is no precedent or shorthand.<br/><br/>It may just come down to some fans valuing different things in their Star Wars than I do, and that's okay. I will never understand how some apparently feel that the film is "insulting" to a character like Luke Skywalker -- to me it was a more loving, triumphant, fitting and poignant use of that character than I could have hoped for. I don't expect all those upset to come fully around to how I feel, but I do hope some of them get a taste of it eventually, because from where I'm sitting we have a truly exceptional movie. I've now seen almost 300 films that came out this year, and this may go down as my favorite of them all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke cuts himself off from the force?? I had to walk out to calm down a little.  Rey STILL has no training, yet she is just as powerful as Kylo Ren??  Luke couldn't levitate an x-wing under the tutelage of Yoda, but Rey can levitate a hundred boulders, again, with NO training??  Leia flies through space?? What is this nonsense? We wanted an original STORY, not a copy of a past movie, like The Force Awakens copied A New Hope.  An original story does not mean forsaking everything the original movies were about.  Luke would NEVER cut himself off from the force and go into exile, it's ludicrous.  And how about the tremendous disappointments of NOT finding out who Snoke is, or where he came from, or the terrible reveal about Rey's parents? I could go on forever and would have walked out of the movie theater if not for the hope that I would get to see Luke do something powerful at the end, only to be tricked into thinking something great was about to happen only to find out Luke isn't even present when he fights - if you can call it a fight - Kylo Ren. This killed Star Wars for me and I have no interest in seeing any further Star Wars movie and I've been a fan since I saw the original in the movie theater as a kid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Luke Skywalker is the embodiment of a character archetype that is as old as storytelling itself. He rises from nothing, pursues knowledge and enlightenment, overcomes despair, becomes a savior, and through courage and determination redeems the sins of the ones who came before him. His purpose as a character and as an icon is to personify everything a human should hope to become.<br/><br/>In The Last Jedi, Luke Skywalker tries to murder a child in his sleep, then cries in a cave for a few years while the world around him crumbles, then gets lectured by a teenager about responsibility, then dies nonsensically. Knowing that, go look at every other plot point and twist in this movie. The film's sole purpose isn't to push things forward or to build upon anything. It is reckless subversion for the sake of subversion. It is deconstruction with no meaning or purpose. It is a cynically assembled soapbox, made by people so arrogant and unappreciative that they would stand atop the legacy of one of film's most quintessential tales just to make an uninsightful, short-sighted point about "leaving the past behind", and toss some hamfisted political notes at the captive audience. It is worse than any corporate cash-in or any moronic prequels. The Last Jedi is an articulate attack on Star Wars itself and everything it represents. These people had no idea what they were dealing with. The Last Jedi was a cinematic manslaughter.<br/><br/>Star Wars and Luke Skywalker can't be tarnished by anyone- that story was already told, and at most is only one fleeting incarnation of one of humanity's oldest traditions. You can't crush that, but The Last Jedi tried.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is the first Star Wars movie that I left feeling sad;  not because beloved characters died, but I came to realize the franchise has no interest in connecting the old with the new. Seriously, Luke deserved better. I had no emotional response to his death scene, just a bad taste in my mouth.  In terms of Snoke, Star Wars 7 did a fantastic job developing a shroud of mystery around him.  I feel the writer gave a giant middle finger to all the background theories out there by purposely killing him off with an amateur jedi trick without revealing one shred of a background story.  It seems like writer Riam Johnson is like Kylo Ren and wants nothing to do with nostalgic ideas of the past. Kill them all with no explanation and lets move on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I loved the pace of the film and was never "bored" with the film.  My main complaint is that I felt the movie spent too much time in space and didn't visit enough new planets.  I also didn't feel the same wonder I felt in previous Star Wars movie.  That being said, I loved Admiral Holdo and Rose.  My whole theater was silent when Holdo hyperspaced into Snoke's mother ship.  Many people disliked when Leia forced back into the ship but I was crying at that point and thought that it was pretty cool.  I feel the humor throughout the movie was done well and wasn't forced (no pun intended) like it was in The Force Awakens.  I was a little upset that they didn't cover Admiral Ackbar's death more, but that might be the fanboy talking.  Yoda's appearance was tasteful and I loved that they kept him in puppet form.  I didn't like Benicio del Toro's character and felt like Finn and Rose's relationship, while cute, was a little forced.  Phasma's death was as disappointing as her first appearance and I do hope that she didn't actually die.  I loved the Rey and Kylo fight scene and felt like Snoke's death made sense because they didn't want to create another emperor.  I don't think that Luke would ever considering slaying Ben Solo so that bothered me a little, but his death was done well and the ending was cute.  I hated porgs at first but kinda liked them at the end.  I know my review was all over the place but I had so many feelings from this movie!  It's my fourth favorite Star Wars movie and I would give it an 8.6 overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The decisions Rian Johnson made with Luke's character were heart-shattering. I think I speak for most fans of the original trilogy: what they did with Luke in this movie was a betrayal of the character that we know Luke is. Mark Hamill said himself he was "insulted" when he read the script. I can only imagine how offended George Lucas is. I can't bring myself to see this movie a second time because it hurts just thinking about Luke. Disney is dead to me. What an absolute shame. What an absolute **** failure.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7937555"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Ante todo, quiero expresar que respeto cada una de las opiniones (aunque algunas no las comprenda).<br/><br/>The Last Jedi ha sido una de las pocas películas que me mantuvo al borde del asiento, haciendo que las más de dos horas se hicieran cortas, una entrega distinta con su propia estampa, la franquicia pedía esto luego de siete episodios, una precuela (Rogue One), y varias series de televisión. El lema es: "Cada generación tiene una historia" y en parte tiene razón, pero siempre bajo una misma línea, esta grandiosa leyenda necesitaba un refresco y eso lo entendió hasta el mismísimo George Lucas cuando decidió venderle los derechos a Disney porque comprendió que todo ciclo tiene su fin, es la ley de la vida, y el suyo terminó con las precuelas. No por esto hay que olvidar a George, siempre estaremos agradecidos de haber creado este fenómeno que se adueñó de los corazones de niños, adolescentes y adultos. Los críticos (público general) no les agradó de The Force Awakens argumentando que tomó demasiadas cosas del episodio IV, ahora los que están en contra de The Last Jedi apuntan que parece una película independiente, por alejarse de la línea de las originales (a mí no me parece tan así).<br/><br/>Ciertamente este episodio ocho va tomando va tomando un camino distinto del habitual, y como lo vengo diciendo es necesario luego de cuarenta años, o sino disney hubiese remasterizado la primera trilogía y listo. ¿Eso es lo que quieren? Yo no.<br/><br/>Lo que más me agradó de The Last Jedi es que no es otra película de Hollywood donde los buenos están bajo presión durante toda la película y en el tramo final de la nada consiguen revertir la situación, pues Rian Johnson no lo quiso así, acá no hay un claro dominio del "bien" o "mal", y nos enseña que todo objetivo requiere de mucho sacrificio y dolor para lograrlo.<br/><br/>------- SPOILERS --------<br/><br/>¿Cuál es el verdadero enojo del público?<br/><br/>En lo personal, creo que la gente que salió disgustada fue porque no se cumplió la teoría que la mayoría esperaba sobre el linaje de Rey, decisión a la cual aplaudo. "Dinámica de lo impensado" esta frase no aplica solo para el fútbol, para tener éxito muchas veces hay que arriesgarse, aunque habrá gente que no les guste ese estilo, pero a muchos otros sí. No hay nada de malo que Rey sea hija de unos "don nadie" acaso que para que la fuerza se manifieste debes ser obligatoriamente de un linaje heroico? Como lo dejó claro Luke, la fuerza no es sólo levantar rocas o usar un sable de luz, la fuerza es todo lo que rodea a esa galaxia lejana que es el poderoso aliado de los desamparados, de aquellos que a pesar de su situación crítica prevalecen con esperanza (como es el caso de Rey que a pesar de los años, ella seguía esperando a su familia en Jakku). Ciertamente a Rey le faltó algo de entrenamiento, pero si nos vamos a ese punto, Luke no terminó su entrenamiento tampoco en el episodio V y pudo por lo menos combatir a Darth Vader. No entiendo como hay gente que compara esta película con los primeros tres episodios, esos episodios sí se alejaron totalmente de lo que en realidad es Star Wars llenando la pantalla de política, diálogos innecesarios y romance al estilo de Romeo y Julieta. Acá empieza un nuevo trayecto donde se pone fin a la política y al ámbito religioso, y comienza la esperanza. LO MEJOR DE LA PELÍCULA<br/><br/>- El desarrollo de los personajes; sobretodo Kylo Ren, Rey, Luke, Poe y Leia.<br/><br/>- Lo impredecible de la trama<br/><br/>- Efectos visuales<br/><br/>LO QUE NO ME GUSTO<br/><br/>- Desenlace de Snoke<br/>- Falta de explicación de algunos tópicos.<br/><br/>En general, yo concuerdo con la crítica de los expertos, una maravillosa película.﻿</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It seems people are merely upset over the fact that old characters are passing, and they no longer use unrealistic fight scenes from the prequels. Regardless, it's a good story with a great twist that may seem confusing to non-die-hard fans, or people who don't understand the force. I'll give it 9/10, because The Force Awakens deserves a 10/10 and Rain Johnson simply cannot recreate JJ Abrams story-telling ability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I do not mind that this movie was about destroying the past to make way for the future, but the way it did it was just terrible. It was just terrible terrible script writing. Furthermore, I’d be surprised if the writers knew anything about the universe because they added so much ridiculous stuff that was just idiotic. Some examples include - Leia flying through spaces (she gets back in the ship without any sort of depressurisation and everyone’s fine and dandy), Yoda using his powers (why doesn’t Yoda, alone, destroy the first order then?), gravity in space, the ATAT’s land on that planet faster than Finn can get there (where did the ATAT’s even come from if the fleet was destroyed?), only one brief lightsaber fight scene, the ships run out of space fuel for the first time in the franchise, Snoke is just randomly killed (could’ve been done so much better), Luke is a whiney bum, Luke’s death is unbelievably unsatisfying and pointless, and for some reason the secret plan was held back from Poe (and therefore the audience) for no good reason... this is by no means an exhaustive list of all the things I hated about the film either! It was just trash. Horrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

More fans are noticing this time and not giving it a pass. Disney has changed the philosophy of Star Wars which used to embrace a deep history and they are changing where the good guys and the bad guys want nothing to do with the past; they burn it down, run from it and diminish the old to prop up the new characters. The past is inconvenient to the movies because they do not know how to connect it to the present, and the movie does not want to bother with the past.  And they want so badly to create their own Darth Vader, and give birth to the most powerful Jedi ever, they will pull everything down to force it to work. Star Wars fans want the history to be respected, understood, with some consistency of power and limits.   The biggest complaint about the Last Jedi is many scenes and actions are reversed immediately; they constantly make someone die then not, or the hate someone then not, or turn dark then not.  The movie is trying to be super tricky, as if to leave the door open for any possibility for any character.  Therefore everyone is bipolar, except for Snoke he just was evil but wasted quickly. There should be no redemption for Kylo, but they probably will.  Rey shows a lot of violent anger, and is open to the dark, but no she will be some super powerful grey jedi.  I did enjoy Kylo and Rey fighting together but that also was reversed.  Although I sort of enjoyed parts of the Last Jedi, the story leaves us with little; a small rebel group, like one First Order ship, and a war of no consequence. Luke was found after the whole first movie, but little pay off to the story. I am still hoping for some pay-off to show that the story was CRAFTED for more than a scene by scene basis, but it will be tough to write out of the corner they painted themselves into. I bet the next movie will take place years in the future, they will write out Leia, and that kid with the ring at the end will lead a new rebellion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Welcome to Star Wars Episode 8, just like Final Fantasy 8, anything labelled with an eight should fill you with dread. This film takes all the things that were good about the original series, sticks them in a blender and shats on them. In a move by Disney to make Episodes 1-3 seem good in comparison. All your favourite characters and their images are ruined and instea filled with social justice propoganda. You shouldn't even watch this movie even for free, as the hours you will waste watching it, not only will have you grasping for those hours of your lives back, you'll be forever traumatised knowing that Disney came and ruined your childhood memories. Sign the 'Last Jedi' petition and let's have this travesty removed from official canon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This movie was awesome and Rian Johnson did a great job. Anybody who thinks none of the other Star Wars movies contain their fair share of plot holes and faults is crazy, cuz they all do. This movie rips the saga out of the "fans'" hands and shows that Johnson had all intentions of making something original and his own. I love the lack of generic star wars tropes. It feels new and different and I love the he'll out of it for those reasons. Wish Johnson was doing episode 9, I'm afraid we might get a reskinned return of the Jedi with JJ. Regardless, Johnson made the sky the limit with the future of this saga and I'm super pumped about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

They have shown zero respect for the beloved original characters and I am nowhere near emotionally invested enough in their new characters to actually care what happens to them. I'm done. TFA was bad enough but at least presented some hopeful plot points for the future. This new movie not only did not deliver on those plot points, but completely laid waste to the heart and soul of the franchise - Luke Skywalker. I trusted that Disney knew how to be a caretaker of such a legacy franchise. I cannot believe how wrong I was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I have moved on from disbelief to anger. The film is a mess. It squanders a largely talented cast of actors including Mark Hamill to set fire to the legacy of the originals and succeeds in burying the franchise in one go.  Script is dire.  The plot is complete nonsense.  There is zero suspense and about million instances of just pure terrible moments. The Leia scene in space is just the worst thing that's ever happened in a film. That this made it through a test screening and an editing process is frankly astonishing.  I wish I'd never seen it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Granted, I was 8, but I do recall being disappointed. For MANY years after, Empire was always the weak link for me. I loved Star Wars and Return of the Jedi, but not Empire. As I got older, I obviously realized how great it was, and now it's by far my favorite. It took me probably 15 years to get there, though. Being 45 going into this one, it didn't take quite as long, but I still left the theater feeling a little unsure about what I just watched. In a very broad sense, a lot of what I hoped to see made it into the movie, but almost none of it in a way that I remotely expected. There was also quite a bit that I did not see coming. I loved TFA, and I love the Last Jedi. It is NOT all that similar to what's come before, and with a little time to digest, I think that's precisely what loved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie is OK and mediocre, visuals are stunning and some of the scenes are good. But what really killed it for me is the story and dismissing the lore star-wars already have. The bad jokes, the Mary sue Rey, Snoke, there is a lot of things wrong here but killing of these characters and not doing justice in doing so is a big dick move. I get it, there is new heroes, new age is coming to star-wars. I have no problem with that in fact I will support it for the future generation to enjoy same as I did when I was a kid. However, without proper story telling it won't work. Fans will not love Rey cause she is just strong and she is a female. Wonder Woman did it right why can't you? Too much political agenda as well. But what really hurt me is how they did Luke. I watch a lot of Hamill's disappointment and now I get why. Disney please don't do Episode 9 and return Starwars to GL. :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

For us, it's about learning to accept that we are wrong, and that we can't predict the future of what's going to happen in a movie, though apparently most people have refused to accept that lesson. For the characters of the film itself, it's about learning who they will be moving forward, sometimes from characters many of us have grown to love, or from characters we may grow to hate, but it's all learning, and that makes it very interesting indeed. I hope as time goes on, and if people see this review, they'll realize this. The film is not perfect, but to review based on what you expected it to be instead of what it is, is a constant sign of failure. Star Wars: The Last Jedi easily earns a 9 from me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Something is just fundamentally wrong with the story.  It seems that a lot of people have this kind of experience.  Now why is that?  Most films do not do that, why this one does?  I think this is something the writers of later Star Wars films need to seriously consider.<br/><br/>Now I will offer my 2 cents as to why that is.  But first realize that it’s not just the hardcore fans that may not like this movie.  I am a fan, but not a hardcore one.  I only watched Star Wars movies and nothing else (no books, animation, lore etc), probably like most people.  The reason is more fundamental than the SW universe itself.<br/><br/>Might contain spoilers.<br/><br/>The writer tries very hard to tackle many themes in this movie, and he/she failed in many of them.  Let’s take a look at 2 of them:<br/><br/>The Force is For Everyone / Everything: Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with this idea, and it does not violates the stories of previous Star Wars films (there were many Jedi/Sith, and Obi-wan also explained it to Luke in similar ways etc).  But the problem is: to use/harness something, one should require to  WORK for it, even if they are talented.  It’s like writers need to learn and practice how to write, engineers need to learn math and science, even talented Mozart need to learn from very young age about violin & piano, and Jedi needs to learn about the force and practice using it.  But in this movie, people can use & harness something so great without learning & practicing.  That just strays tooooooo far away from people’s everyday experience, and when this happens, people will feel some kind of fundamental inconsistency (Mary Sue etc), and start to feel that this is a bad story.<br/><br/>Flawed Heroes: This is another theme the movie tries to develop in several plot lines, but failed.  Once again, there is nothing wrong with this idea, and flawed heroes, tragic heroes, legend vs reality theme has been tackled in previous SW films.  However, when you have characters that act in ways that do not follow common sense, you need to clarify it somehow.  And when you have an established character that did something so fundamentally against what they were...it just does not work.  Flawed heroes do not mean a fundamental change in characters, it just meant that heroes have BOTH vice and virtue as well.  There might be many other failed themes, but these are 2 I can think of now.  The writers of SW really need to think about what kind of story are they trying to tell, instead of trying and failing all over the place.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

My parents loved me. I have a good job. My wife and kids treat me well...but I would trade it all if doing so meant that I could un-watch The Last Jedi.<br/><br/>History will probably remember this film as "The Star Wars with a reenactment of the O.J. Simpson chase as the main story". And that's if they're lucky.<br/><br/>I can't believe I'm typing this, but in the first 10 minutes of the film, the rebels successfully disable an enemy warship by flying straight up to it in an X-wing, calling the ship's captain directly - and being patched straight through to him, then feigning a bad audio connection to distract him while they blow up all the cannons on the deck. It's an astonishing early indication that Rian Johnson made this film using roughly the same process that a 7-year-old might use when he starts talking to other 7-year-olds without thinking about what he was going to say first.<br/><br/>For the next 2 hours and 32 minutes, the audience gets punched in the intellectual balls over, and over, and over again. Then the movie ends.<br/><br/>The budget was well spent on visual effects, but everything else about the movie from the script, to the plot itself, to the dozens of wildly useless scenes and characters was flat out stupefying.<br/><br/>So bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The story is far better than Seven - which was basically a New Hope rehash (without improving it).  Plot moves in welcome new directions, effects are great, there's character development galore... and it's FUNNY! This movie rocks.<br/><br/>The disenchantment from 'fans' goes way beyond partisan.   Lamenting plot holes is absurd for space opera genre movies like this; these are not only standard fare but also largely beside the point.  I've seen all three trilogies (2/3 of the most current of course...)in their original runs, and they all shine in their own right and for their TIME.  Each is distinctly fun in a different way.  Expecting them to merely recreate past glory is both futile and boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The opening lines most of all. My goal was to approach this with a level head rather than give into the pointless rage that seems to be gripping many reviewers. There’s plenty to be angry about, after all. But the more I reflected on it the more it became clear that I don’t feel anger at all. I feel sadness. The Last Jedi broke my heart.<br/><br/>Rian Johnson wanted to take Star Wars in a new direction. I don’t fault him or Disney for that. This is not the first time that changes have enraged a fandom. It certainly won’t be the last. But this shift is not merely a change in scope or some bold new direction for the franchise. It’s a bellwether for Disney’s vision of the future. It’s the death of Star Wars as we knew it.<br/><br/>Just like thousands of others, I’ve enumerated my very own list of things that put me off about TLJ. But rather than nail my grievances to the Internet like the Martin Luther of Nerds, I think the most important thing to do is to add context to all the complaints about the “tone” of the movie.<br/><br/>Abrams and Johnson delivered starkly different messages with their films. Abrams tells audiences that The Force Awakens will “begin to make things right” and that what made Star Wars special can be reclaimed by a new generation. Conversely, Johnson urges the audience to forge a new path toward the future. Rather than build upon Abram’s foundation he declares with The Last Jedi that the past must be left behind. It’s true that Abrams rehashed most of the major themes of the original trilogy in Episode VII. TFA didn’t have an original plot. But it used that familiar structure to introduce new characters that felt like a part of the Star Wars universe. Those characters had the potential to organically evolve the franchise over the course of a trilogy. JJ handled the lore with care, like something sacred. He preserved the soul of Star Wars.<br/><br/>Johnson took an aggressive opposition to Abrams’ approach. He brought his audience a more original core story, but chose to undermine Star Wars tropes in favor of a harried race toward the future. He treated the groundwork of The Force Awakens as a list of plot points to clean up rather than as a launch pad for rising action. He made choices that forever closed the doors that Abrams opened.<br/><br/>The best example of this is in the treatment of Anakin’s lightsaber. In The Force Awakens it is a character. It carries weight and guides the action. It acts as a reminder of a tragic past as well as the catalyst for a bright future. For the last two years it has been frozen in time, waiting in Rey’s outstretched hand as her training in the ways of The Force is just about to begin… only to be treated as a slapstick punchline in the end.<br/><br/>I laughed in the theater when Luke tossed his father’s lightsaber over his shoulder. I wanted to find humor in it. Maybe there would be a lesson? Perhaps a Yoda-esque farce? But like most of The Last Jedi, it was an empty action; a cheap subversion of expectations. From that moment the lightsaber was simply a prop. Its role in Luke’s life barely acknowledged. Its thrall over Rey forgotten. The details of its recovery left to some future spin off movie. Where Abrams saw meaning and nuance in the rich history of Anakin’s lightsaber, Johnson saw a brutal laser sword that tethered him to someone else’s narrative. The destruction of Anakin’s lightsaber was not poetic. It was not a symbol for the conflict between Rey and Kylo Ren. It was a message: what came before is ended.<br/><br/>I’m not angry at Rian Johnson. I’m not angry at Disney. I’m sad that The Force Awakens was a one-off. It was a “Star Wars Story.” Its questions will never have answers. In the end it didn’t make things right at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The dialogue is mostly good, and the acting is fantastic. The visuals are incredible, and so is the fight choreography (what little there is in the film). I also enjoy that the film respects the prequels and celebrates in a balance between the new and old Star Wars. The only reason I don't like the film is strictly Luke Skywalker's unfortunate and unseemly death. I mean - Rose was kind of in the way, but that's minor compared to the horrid act that is killing Luke Skywalker. Such an event will not be forgotten. Moving on from the past to focus strictly on the new is a naive and childish concept that has turned a franchise with some potential into a franchise with essentially no potential whatsoever. Episode IX will be interesting, but I am not in the slightest bit excited for its release. Solo and Kenobi will almost certainly be horrendous films and fail critically. This film was an atrocity to mankind. Artists need to learn that their actions have consequences. I do hope that Disney learns their lesson, and avoids damaging other franchises such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe and The X-Files. I suppose we'll see. In the meantime - go see the first two thirds of The Last Jedi! It's a fantastic first two thirds of a film!
