Yes, Johnson takes risks and completely blows up parts of SW canon that is sure to have Luke-loving fanboys crying tears of saltiness, but at the same time he takes SW into a very bold new direction. The standouts in this film are Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, who both share some of the film's best moments. ***SPOILER ALERT***<br/><br/>Leia finally using the force was one of the most clap-inducing moments in the theater during my showing. ***END SPOILER***<br/><br/>While the movie does sometimes pack in too many plot threads, and new characters lack development, overall it was an enjoyable experience. However, with the slate pretty much wiped clean for Episode IX, I am hoping for a time jump of 5-10 years between episodes to allow this new world and order to grow a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

However, I don't want to hate this without explaining at least some of the things that I thought ruined this movie:<br/>1. Slapstick - This is terrible. Jar-Jar was bad, no doubt, but Jar-Jar was one single character. In this movie it seems, the whole cast and even some of the surroundings serve the sole purpose of slapstick. The worst thing, however, is that:<br/>2. Atmosphere is intentionally destroyed to fit in more slapstick. There are moments with epic J.W. - music building f.e. up to a climax that suddenly get muted or at least muffled to fit in one more slapsticky joke. wtf.<br/>3. The Empire - OFC, the empire and their understanding of warfare has never been great by any means, however, this time around it feels like the empire doesn't only make their beloved mistake of building a DS-like super weapon. It seems they deliberately try to waste as many resources as possible. Never before has an opposing force in a SW - movie acted so freaking stupid.<br/>4. Snoke is wasted - Snoke was the only villain left that got at least some potential. With this movie Disney effectively ruined their franchise. Anyhow, what about Snoke's death? WTF - he's build up to be the most powerful sith left in this universe and gets killed in such a meaningless way... How can't he notice Ren turning against him?<br/>5. Ren turning against Snoke - There are what? 3? 4? Establishing shots, showing Ren's fighting his inner chaos, making a decision between dark and light side ... sadly at least 3 out of 4 are in the force awakens not in this movie. I don't say that Ren turning against Snoke wasn't obvious, all I'm saying is it wasn't established by any means in this terrible mess of a movie.<br/><br/>I could go on but this quite literally hurts ... I hope you get the idea.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Old fans seemed to hate it, giving it 'extreme' negative ratings even on this website.  The reality is that it is a Star Wars film made for the newer fans, a passing of baton of sort. As Luke Skywalker passes the mantle of this franchise to newcomer Rey, so should this franchise seek what can be considered as 'new customers'.  For me, it is a great Star Wars film, and the complete polar opposite of the Force Awakens.  While the latter is essentially a love letter to the original trilogy (some even accuse it of being a carbon copy), The Last Jedi's whole purpose is the upend any sort of notions that you have of the franchise.  Johnson writes and directs this like a slow burn thriller...starts of with a bang..slows down for some exposition..before turning the storyline with twist after twist.  I myself enjoyed this thoroughly as for the first time, we have no idea how the story will turn up.  These series of twists and major changes are the points of contention for 'older fans', a fanbase that has digested loads of materials in the so called expanded universe (now made 'obsolete' by Disney).  Other than that, absolutely great set pieces and high production values similar to TFA.  Face it folks, Star Wars are here to stay, whether you like it or not.  Disney is now the purveyor of many major franchises beside SW thanks to its purchase of 20th Century Fox and in my opinion, they are in good hands. Bravo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

What Knights of Ren?<br/>- Lightsaber duels? Never heard of them.<br/>- Star Wars: The Force Awakens? Never seen it, but i'll make a sequel anyway.<br/>- Plot? Pfffft. Just have some special effects and go home kid.<br/>- Broom boi.<br/><br/>SPOILERS END<br/><br/>This is the worst Star Wars movie since The Christmas Special.

Reasons:<br/><br/>1) The plot is intriguing and rapidly changing, it keeps your attention throughout the movie.<br/><br/>2) The characters are flawless. They all have their separate personalities, and every one is conflicted throughout. Rey and Kylo have somewhat of a bond in the movie, and their interactions, especially on Snoke's Star Destroyer, were interesting and believable. Rey changes from a naive little girl, to a headstrong, determined, but filled with internal conflict at the end. Kylo goes from a monster in TFA, to in doubt about his future in Last Jedi. 3) The film is unique. No Star Wars movie is like it. And I love it for that. I personally don't want a remake of Empire, so to have something different is a breath of fresh air. 4) The dialogue is decent, but it is delivered in interesting ways. In the prequels, characters deliver dialogue in a very basic and boring way. They are usually sitting on a couch, or walking to nowhere when they speak. Here, there is energy in the dialogue, and the characters don't just talk on a couch.<br/><br/>5) The twists. Killing Snoke off was a fantastic move, as it ensures Episode 9 isn't going to be a rehash of Return of the Jedi. Admiral Holdo's character and death were believable. Most of all, there were so many points the movie could have ended at, but didn't. 9/10, only bad was the codebreaker/casino subplot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Unfortunately, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie as the film is absolutely brimming with poor one-liners, quips and Marvel-style eye-rollers.<br/><br/>Characters from the Force Awakens and original trilogy have all been equally wasted here. The Last Jedi offers a plot that goes practically nowhere, with more holes in it than swiss cheese. Each character arch is more uninspired than the last - especially that of Finn. Finn was perfectly set up after the end of Force Awakens, with the potential to become an incredible character within the Star Wars universe - so what do we get? I can only describe it as a circus act, a dreadful scene on the planet of Kantobyte, with his new-found crybaby companion (Who is so completely forgettable, I can't even remember her name).<br/><br/>Luke felt slightly out of character, and definitely did not live up to his potential as an all-powerful Jedi Master. Snoke was possibly one of the most 'WTF' moments in the film, he came and went like a fart in the wind. Where did he come from? How did he rise to the top of the First Order? Did he create the First Order? Who is he? Who trained him? Are there other Sith? Where are the Knights of Ren? Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like we will ever have answers to these questions, since Rian Johnson doesn't feel any of it is worth explaining.<br/><br/>With all that being said, there are some great scenes on offer; Kylo and Rey fighting side-by-side is superb, but the few enjoyable scenes just aren't enough to overcome the sheer atrocities that make up the rest of the experience.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for the fans. This a movie made to bolster a new generation of Star Wars films that will ultimately make a **** of cash for Disney.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie is visually stimulating and their are certainly some interesting and cool scenes.  The problems however are numerous. They are treating the old cast as completely disposable. Han is dead. Luke is basically a weak old man who breast feeds from an alien. Leia can somehow survive the vacuum of space using the force?  R2 and C3p0 are side notes.   The characters we are left with besides Rey and Kylo are cardboard. Who cares about Poe, Finn or Rose - they are boring and they are meant to replace Han,Luke,Leia, Lando?  Wow.  I have no problem with a torch pass, but jeez. There are also many plot jumps and holes throughout film too numerous to list. I hope the last one saves it somehow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

All of the cast succeed in portraying interesting, three dimensional characters. The Music and and the visuals are stunning, as you might expect. But it really is Rian Johnsons direction and writing that makes this movie so special. He managed to infuse Star Wars with new ideas and concepts, while keeping the core of what makes Star Wars special. The dynamic of Luke and Rey, Snoke and Kylo is fascinating. I especially love Lukes Character development before and in this film, and Mark Hamills portrayal. Unlike Anakin Skywalkers character development in the Prequels, Luke Skywalkers path here made sense. You can see his conflict and his suffering, and understand how on impulse and fear he thought for an instant to kill Ben. This informs Kylos path as well, as it is equally understandable how terrifying this must have been for him, pushing him over to the dark side. The interplay between Rey and Kylo Ren via force skype was also very well done and interesting. I was really wondering during the whole throne room scene wether Kylo could be turned. This sequence is a big setup for the final confrontation between Rey and Kylo in Episode IX.<br/>General Leia had a bigger part in this movie then i expected. She finally got to use the force, but it´s really her message of Hope thats important to the movie. Despite all the loss and sacrifice, she will never give up. Her relationship with Poe and Holdo worked quite well, showing her development since Return of the Jedi. I loved that the "our chances to pull this off are one in 15.623" plan did not work out for once. It showed Poe and Finn that their hot head approach may just not work every time. Finn and Rose do not actually contribute to the immediate story, but they manage to give the enslaved children of Canto Bight hope for the future. The final scene of the movie takes us back to the message of The Force Awakens and sets up the future of the franchise in a big way. The next generation of Force users is on the way, probably to be trained by the Last Jedi, Rey, but what will they identify as?<br/>Star Wars is often described as "black vs white", and belittled for it, because the world is "grey". But Rian Johnsons writing manages to come back at this with DJ and the Canto Bight sequence. I think this shows us that this kind of moral relativism is, in the end, just black, just evil. The rich slave holding weapon traders are not grey, they are just evil. And to me, that gets a point across to the real world. If you sell weapons to places like Saudi Arabia, you are not grey, you´re evil. If you eat chocolate that nine year old kids are forced to work for, you´re not grey, you are just evil.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Even though most user reviews are describing it as Porg-overwhelmed pulp for mass audiences, it's much more about the characters' internal conflicts and finally having them undestand what the balance in the Force is really about. Where "The Force Awakens" showed us recycled planets from the original trilogy with new names, "The Last Jedi" shines with creativity by showing us places we've never been to before - just like Lucas intended it to be. One particular place (you'll know which one it is once you see it in the movie) reminds us, that the galaxy is not just divided between The First Order and The Resistance, but also has a lot of neutral space that's ruled only by business. The cinematography is very interesting and really gets into the heroes' heads, though the usage of CGI is a bit more noticable than in "The Force Awakens". I know it may sound pretentious, but there weren't enough puppets and other practical effects that had worked so well in the previous part of the "Star Wars" saga. Even if not everything looks 100% real, the movie still has many moments where the whole audience, including always-talking 12 year olds, was silent and just watched in awe. I found the soundtrack a bit disappointing as well. It was as good as in every other part of the series, but I don't think you'll be able to find anything new worth remembering like "The Imperial March", "Binary Sunset", "Duel of the Faiths" or a much newer Rey's theme.<br/><br/>Many questions are answered, more remain unanswered, even more new questions are raised - the movie is an excellent bridge between episodes VII and IX and lets some fresh air into th Star Wars franchise and it's lore. In my personal ranking, it's the best Star Wars movie so far - never has the line between the Dark Side and the Light Side been so blurry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

What to say about it? The whole movie is atrocious. The plot literally is this: Rebels (Resistance, whatever) are running away in a small ship from a big ship in the slowest space-chase ever. Then they go to a planet and run away some more. Iconic characters die in anti-climactic ways. No new lore is introduced, old lore - even from TFA - gets effectively nuked. Don't spend your hard earned cash on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Sure stuff happened in between but nothing was answered and the situation at the very start is the same as at the end. The longest film to date literally has the smallest amount of story progression and character development.<br/>The fact that all the good parts from TFA including its mysteries and unanswered questions (snoke and rey, knights of ren? ) are thrown away after 2 minutes of screen time is disgraceful<br/><br/>This film has far too much time wasted on scenes with no use, the whole finn and rose storyline is shocking and it is clear there was no plan for the finn character other than to hide the fact rey was the jedi in TFA.<br/><br/>Other than the absolutely terrible story aspects the parts of the film meant to be entertaining were ruined by the *terrible* humour that was cringeworthy and far too frequent. It sounds like im saying this for the sake of it- but this was literally an MCU movie. guardians of the galaxy set in the star wars universe. The fact that audiences love this **** makes me quite annoyed. There are 0 stakes for the characters and in this no attachment to the characters. They are so poorly developed anyway but imagine you cared for some of them--> any time they are in danger or in harms way they just make a joke and slip away. audiences love it? its ****<br/><br/>There is literally more time devoted to the token asian girl saving horses than there is rey training with luke or snoke<br/><br/>i had this movie rated a two but have reduced it to a one thinking of the heinous leia scene.<br/><br/>rose is literally worse than jar jar binks.<br/><br/><br/>I wanted to love this movie and i told off my friend for saying it was **** before i saw it. Wow I was wrong, rian johnson and all the critics raving about it cause it was "fun" hang your head in shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Walking out of the cinema, I had this empty feeling wishing they could have done much more given the screen time of the movie<br/><br/>In terms of plot, this movie does so very little and almost seems at times afraid to let you understand or get to know the characters better. It felt that Disney wanted to keep things ambiguous so that they could expand the universe in the future because they weren't sure at the moment how they were going to develop certain characters.<br/><br/>The editing of the movie also affected the final product in that it felt loosely stitched together. You could tell that there were various teams filming various parts separately and when it was put together and edited, the film lacked cohesiveness not to mention the countless plot holes that the film has.<br/><br/>The director has left this film and series in a state of absolute ambiguity just like our favorite characters in this franchise. It had it's moments but the marvel-fying of this movie just felt awkward and out of place like an overcooked piece of steak.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I've seen people say that it's 'the worst Star Wars movie', which is a ridiculous comment to make when you look at what was in The Clone Wars (acting, script, tons of exposition, childish humour etc.)<br/><br/>The Last Jedi is by no means a perfect movie and there are some story arcs which I feel weren't needed (Finn and Rose, for instance) and the whole casino segment felt very out of place, but I liked what they were trying to convey with this. Like in Rogue One, it shows that it isn't as clean cut as 'good v bad' and that there are many people out there looking to make money and that's it.<br/><br/>On top of this, I also felt that the scene where Leia uses the force to float back into the ship just really didn't work. If they wanted to have her out of the picture whilst we're introduced to a new character, having her injured from a blast would've worked a lot better.<br/><br/>With the negatives out of the way, I loved the scenes with Rey and Luke, loved the continued story of Kylo and how being under Snoke is affecting him even more and the battles both on ground and in space felt grand in scale. I particularly loved the opening scene and felt it was a great way to kick The Last Jedi off.<br/><br/>Pacing wise, I loved it and aside from the casino scene, I was invested in where the story was going and more importantly, I didn't feel like all the key characters were devoid of any danger. It's definitely a film with flaws, but more importantly I enjoyed the film and will definitely go to scene it again. I grew up on the original films and The Empire Strikes Back is my all time favourite film, but I can appreciate where this story is going. The fans of this franchise are very, very passionate and I've expected there to be a split opinion with the user scores, but at the same time I am happy that the people behind this film will get the recognition they deserve.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I normally don't review movies.I Am a lifelong star wars fan, I grew up with the ot and liked the prequels. Never got on the hate train for those. Hated TFA for obvious reasons, liked rogue one even though it has flaws, but holy **** tlj made aotc look like citizen Kane. Bad script, pacing, dialogue, delivery, rationale, plot justification, character building, ending and don't get me started on the humor.nothing gets ezplained. NOTHING! Laura Dern annoyed the **** out of me. Worst line of the movie "god speed rebels", wtf, there is no god in star wars, "may the force be with you" would have been more appropriate. Rey is also proven to be a Mary Sue. Luke was a wasted character. Mark Hamil was the only bright spot. And why the **** was bb8 driving a chicken walker? I'm also for gender equality, but why aren't there any men in charge of the resistance? Not one of them is. Star wars is dead. It's a political propoghanda film with alot of Kathleen Kennedy's meddling involved. I am fan of Rian Johnson's work but you can tell he was nudged in a direction cause his past films are excellent. People like me helped build this franchise especially through the years especially when nobody gave a **** pre 2000's, well not anymore. I am done.bring George back. Please.....fire Kathleen Kennedy.i am angry and want my money back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I came out and was openly saying "I did not like it." This was the first time I have seen a Star Wars film in the cinema and came out saying that. With TFA second viewing I thought it was rubbish and a CGI copy of a New Hope.<br/><br/>This one takes place a few hours or days after TFA. The resistance are continuing the fight against the First Order. Rey is trying to get Luke to train her. Kylo Ren is still a whiny emo kid. 2 Characters go on an "away mission" which is boring and rather forced on to give them something to do. Like I said Kylo Ren is just a whiny emo kid, but he gets that from his Grandfather. Wasn't impressed by the acting of the actress who played Rey, again. The plan the First Order has is dumb, Ade Edmondson is on the bridge of the main ship, which I can not take serious in a serious role, due to his face and facial expressions due to his comedy tv programs. This wastes no end of talent as well like Andy Serkis,Gwendoline Christie, Benicio del Toro and Laura Dern just to name a few. Not only are the actors wasted but the characters are wasted as well in some cases.<br/><br/>It feels like some characters have done a full 180 in a matter of hours as well, there is a scene where a character is looking at screen with sadness because of the amount of lives have just been lost. Then in a few scenes later, that character is "communicating with a bad guy" who is targeting the area the other character and a bunch of other characters are. Now instead of that character telling them to clear the area, the character just continues to "stare." Well done for saving lives or at least trying. There are elements of "comedy" in the film, at one point I thought Jar Jar might appear just add more "comedy." They did not go down well in the cinema I saw it in. I will say one or two did make me smile, not laugh though.<br/><br/>I did learn something from this film, you can become a jedi in a weekend course. The story is dull and slow. The writing isnt much better, the acting is overall meh, the 2 new leads, good comes off as wooden, bad comes off whiny. I did like Mark Hamil's performance, even though I did not think Luke would be like that and neither did Mark Hamill "I fundamentally disagree with every choice for Luke in the Last Jedi."<br/><br/>Can the director be blamed for this? yes, but, it is not 100% his fault, its J.J. Abrams fault, he created all these new characters that have some sort of mystery around them and he knew he could not come up with a satisfying reveal for them, so backed away....Where did we see that before??? Cough - Lost. So not only has he ruined 1 franchise beginning with Star he has ruined 2. Disney should've come up with a solid story that makes sense and is fun, they have a heck of a lot of great (NOW) NON-CANON stuff ti take "inspiration" from. But no. They should've decide how to use the old and new characters better and integrate them together better instead it feels like the new characters are forced at you and going " these are good like them" instead you don't get invested in them as characters and dont care about them. The old characters you do care about because you know them from BETTER MOVIES. So Disney have currently made 3 Star Wars films. I liked 1 which is ROGUE ONE! The other 2 SUCK!!! I am so glad I did not go to the multiplex cinema and went and supported my local indie cinema which cost over half the price less than the multiplex.Did Disney pay critics? This Trilogy is worse than the prequels</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Written and Directed by Rian Johnson by a clueless writer/director who has a tendency to f*ck up his own films namely 2012's Looper, one would be entirely forgiven for having reservations about the film before seeing it. With great trailers made by a marketing team who clearly isn't paid enough, The Last Jedi promoted itself as being the next Empire Strikes Back. Yet we managed to get something more sloppy than Attack of the Clones, with uneven pacing, incomplete arcs, and an all-round lack of appreciation for continuity or the force itself. While the Froce awakens wasn't a great film it is not doubt to me a serviceable entry, sure most of the plot had been duplicated from A New Hope, but it built foundations which would serve as the bed-rock for episode 8 & 9 to carry on from. Those foundations are now gone. Now one can only wonder how JJ Abrahams will salvage the saga to create a fitting conclusion for a trilogy that still is still yet to prove or find what it wants to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This is just a disgrace to the Star Wars series.<br/><br/>Regarding main characters:<br/><br/>Rey is just a rehash of previously shown jedi, she has no development whatsoever. It was even worse than in Episode 7 with her force and jedi combat skills appearing out of nowhere, she is able to stay on par with Kylo Ren in his normal state after 3 (!!!) days of training.<br/><br/>Luke was turned into a complete moron and weakling, the plot was so badly written that they had to bring up Yoda out of nowhere to add some motivation for Luke's actions.<br/><br/>Snoke turned out to be...a plot device, nothing more.<br/><br/>Kylo Ren was exactly the same as in the 7th movie, nothing new.<br/><br/>Finn and Rose Fantastic Beasts-style adventure was a cringefest, it added absolutely NOTHING to the story. Trying to make drama out of Rose’ retarded actions at the end of the film was absolutely disgusting, the same can be said about classic self-sacrificial attempt out of nowhere by Finn (motivation problems?).<br/><br/>On top of that, half of the cast was turned into clowns with classic Disney humor. Seemed like they tried to apply MCU formula to SW universe.<br/><br/>Regarding everything else:<br/><br/>From the beginning to the end, the movie is a complete mess. Too many coincidences, too many illogical actions by the characters, abnormally high amount of explosions and cringey moments, which are supposed to be funny. None of the answers from the part 7 were answered, they were just outright ignored. The only lightsaber combat scene is devoid of any emotions or even decent choreography and looks like an overhyped stage performance. They could’ve done so much with all the material they had, but they’ve decided not to.<br/><br/>Part 8 shares nothing in common with either the original trilogy or even the prequels. Aspects of the universe, in which these movies exceled, are absent here altogether. However, there is nothing to compensate for that. The movie is a massive letdown, a generic blockbuster. This is by no means a Star Wars movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Star Wars had everything going for it, a solid entry with The Force Awakens, even though that movie had weaknesses, nothing to the extreme of The Last Jedi.<br/><br/>The Dialogue banks entirely on slapstick humor, that most of the time doesn´t fit the tone of the movie. This is reminding of other Marvel movies, but is insulting for a franchise of Star Wars magnitude.<br/>The whole subplot from Finn and Rose seemed forced, because they have no on screen chemistry. The planet Canto Bight looked like it was ripped straight out of the Harry Potter franchise. It was not fitting to Star Wars at all and is easily the worst subplot of the movie.<br/>Apparently you can also drop bombs in zero gravity, but Leia manages to fly trhough zero gravity in her best Mary Poppins imitation, by what can only be described as the worst single scene of the whole Star Wars franchise.<br/>The whole plot about the escape of the Resistance from the First Order could have been resolved with simple communication between General Holdo and Poe Dameron.<br/>Luke, the most powerful Jedi that brought balance to the force is going against Jedi Codex to murder the child of his Sister Lea and his best Friend Han Solo...<br/>The much teased Supreme Leader Snoke gets no further background information, we do not get to know who he is or how he seized power. In the end he simply gets tricked by his own hubris.<br/>There are other flaws, such as the force ghost Yoda, that summons lightning and hitting Luke, it seems like the established ground rules from the last trilogies do not apply anymore. BB-8 basically gets to be a one man army, that helps to fix glaring plot holes. Captain Phasma gets send off without ever accomplishing anything. Many of these small issues can be found over the course of the 153 minutes of runtime.<br/><br/>The movie does have positive parts, it is visually stunning and has some very visually pleasing scenes. The sound and soundtrack are again on point and the battle scenes are spectacular. Kylo Ren and Reys bond is an interesting choice and can be called the strongpoint of this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, visually stunning action is not enough for a beloved franchise that mesmerized generatioins. The story is very weak and unplausbible, some characters do not get explored enough and new ones are simply uninteresting. Rian Johnson managed to split the fanbase with a movie that is objectivly bad at times, but also has strong points now and again.<br/>I left the cinema excited for the future movies, i left this one heartbroken and scared, what the future holds. Rian Johnson is already confirmed to lead a new trilogy. I want to remember Star Wars, my childhood, in a positive light and the direction it is threatening the franchise.<br/>This movie was a disaster and i am not sure if they can manage to turn it around.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

All of them seemed to be boring and predictable, milking the same old stories: good guys beat bad guys, the young reckless kid is right, etc.<br/><br/>So I went to this movie fully expecting this kind of crap. Fortunately (and surprisingly), I was completely blown away by this movie. Every minute kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what is going to happen next. I have not felt this kind of suspense while watching a movie for years.<br/><br/>Outside this, the movie has some amazing scenes. I was constantly getting goosebumps, and I'm considering going to see it again only to watch one of such scenes.<br/><br/>I would say that this movie is a masterpiece, the best Star Wars movie since "The Empire Strikes Back". By far. I cannot recommend enough that you go watch it. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There is an overabundance of cheap laughs uncharacteristic of a Star Wars movie. These take up an exceedingly large amount of time that could have been used developing an underwhelming plot. On the topic of plot, no plot lines from The Force Awakens are promisingly fulfilled, many of them outright ignored; most if not all of the ones that were addressed are just blankly cut off in the most mundane ways possible. Instead of a fulfilling continuation (of a trilogy admittedly off to a bad start), we get even more random plot lines, plot holes, and blatant "Screw You's" from Rian Johnson and the writing staff.<br/><br/>No character comes out of this movie looking better, besides somewhat Kylo Ren. In no surprising fashion, Rey has been confirmed to be the greatest Mary Sue possible. Luke has completely regressed as a character. Every character's actions and decisions throw away consistency, and many of them just don't make any logical sense. There are some blatant throw-in's for identity politics as well.<br/><br/>It's honestly just astonishing at how much screen time was wasted; how many plot holes were introduced; how mundanely plot lines were wrapped up (or outright ignored), and how awful the characterization was. Acting was great, as was visuals and music; all expected of a Star Wars movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The flow is constantly zip-zagging between intriguing plot twists, slow-paced sequences, breathtaking battles, semi-pointless characters and narrative archs, and impressive scenery. Some answers are given to the audience: some could turn out to be unsatisfactory and some may never be answered at all. The film is a courageous move by director Rian Johnson that will not please everyone but which could thrust this cinematic universe into wide variety of possibilities.

This movie is a punch in the face of every star wars fan. They make legendery characters ridiculous, such as Yoda and Luke. It had some interesting ideas but the movie never could develop them because Disney did what Disney always does with movies: They put stupid cheesy jokes in the movie. The days of serious star wars movies are gone. Diseny destroyed a whole franchise within 2 years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

By the end my whole theater stood up and left. No clapping like Rogue One. And by the time people made it to the restroom, they were arguing about which elements were worse. I can't say I didn't laugh at times, or that it was 100% bad, but this feels like a disservice and a money grab.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

After The Force Awakens  i hoped many things would be explained in this followup movie. But you leave the theater with more questions than before. Also: For me the Star Wars Universe is very dark and sinister (especially the Sith). The Jedi represent the other side: strong, honorable knights of the light side. In this movie i think everybody is a friggin, absolutely useless moron. Every character doesn't fit in his role and you respect none of them. The Last Jedi creates a family friendly ambience throughout the whole movie with jokes and absolutely zero seriousness. You don't fear the dark side because the main antagonists in this movie behave like standup comedians. At moments i thought i was watching Space Balls and not Star Wars...<br/>Many decisions by the characters in the movie make no sense and the pace in the middle part is absolutely horrible. But the worst thing about the movie is how the characters can use the force without any training. In 6 movies we learned that it is very difficult to master the ways of the force. Many people inside the Star Wars universe don't even know that the force exists. But here it seems to be as easy as taking a dump after dinner.<br/>If you don't know the Star Wars Universe and haven't seen any Star Wars movies before you will enjoy yourself. You can even call it Guardians of the Galaxy 3 if you like. But as a Star Wars fan i am VERY disappointet by this movie and can only give it 4 out of 10 points.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Innitialy i was not sure why i was disappointed, but more i think about it more i realize, its because of incompetent and fool villains, and also how the movie treated Luke Skywalker. The guy foiled the plans of the most cunning, resourceful and powerful sith, the guy who turned the galaxies most infamous and badass villain to the light side. I would go as far as and say, this movie is more disappointing than Phantom Menace, at least Phantom Menace give us Darth Maul and some memorable lightsaber duel. I can not say anything else without spoiler. Go ahead and watch it, and decide for yourself. Its not a terrible movie, but in my honest opinion it is the lowest point in star wars films.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not to mention all the extra fluff characters that didn't need to be introduced, like purple hair girl, and Asian girl who had a hard life and doesnt like rich things. 99% of the drama was created just by the main characters **** up, so when things get resolved, you don't feel like they accomplished anything.<br/>The only interesting character was Luke with Rey and Kylo kind of being okay.<br/>But they just **** all over Lukes story with the piss poor resolution.<br/><br/>Not to mention that this movie hardly progresses the story in anyway. You could just go from the end of episode 7 directly to the end of episode 8, and the main characters are pretty much in the same position they started.<br/><br/>God. There were some really good moments in the movie to, but they were just eclipsed by how anticlimatic the story felt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It now has more in common with Transformers than it does with the original Star Wars. Too many plot holes and inconsistencies, they haven't answered any of the questions that The Force Awakens left us with. I really do not understand high praises and scores. The last Jedi seems to be targeting younger audience. For original Star Wars fans this film is not. I really hope that viewers will be able to get past all the visual effects, forced jokes and cheap twists to give it rating that it deserves so that Disney would rethink their strategy for the episode IX.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

There were a lot of things different and it went out of its comfort zone. We always wanted to see something new from SW and this film did that. And we also never expected twists which is good.There were some scenes that were really good, well thought out and executed perfectly and just made you feel excited. It also showed some really good stories but there are a lot of flaws but even with those flaws the film is still good. The flaws would be that some of the side plots were completely unnecessary and not needed in the film. It was also a little bit of a mess on how they told the story and there are some characters that are just completely not developed.There are a lot if twists going on in the film but those twists don't have an impact since there is no development at all for these twist which is really a waste. The twists in the film when combined together will not match up to the level of the Empire Strikes Back plot twist. Sometimes the humor was good but sometimes it was really cringey and that made the dialogue suffer. The new characters were not really needed but I believe that they were pretty much fine. Overall, I believe that the film was good. It's not great but it's good. I think that the fans were not happy with the twist and they might not appreciate change, which is hypocritical but everyone has an opinion and for me the film is good and is not a disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson definitely went for a more intellectual approach with this entry, judging by the subtle influences riddled throughout. The action scenes are an incredible ode towards Three Outlaw Samurai, full shots often complimented by stunning imagery. While there is no big twist there are multiple moments of surprise and fan service which will surely make any true fan tear up or smile with joy as the nostalgia trips are strong with this one. The acting is worth mentioning especially in Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher (may she rest in peace) cases who gives the standout performances of their entire careers. The movie does have its problems, mainly story arcs that don't feel compelling enough and some of the new characters are just not that interesting, however the already established Rey, Kylo Ren, Luke Skywalker and Leia make up for this giving us an overall entertaining, endearing, Star Wars experience. I will also take a few moments to point out how disgusted I am at the bunch of people giving this movie 0,1,2 just to bring its score down. These are the bandwagon flag carriers which are the most damaging not only to the film fan community but also to the Star Wars community, giving us a prime example of immaturity and lack of composure and/or ability to have an opinion of their own. While this movie may not be perfect and all film is subjective, this is not a 0, the amount of beautiful looking shots, acting and the music alone raise this movie above any other average flick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson took everything set up in The Force Awakens and threw it away for cheap shock and plot twists. The plot itself is absolutely pointless and two scenes actually manage to introduce massive plot holes in the entire series.<br/><br/>The characters are flat and one-dimensional. Rey becomes even more of a Mary Sue, Finn is wasted and is involved in a boring plotline that doesn't go anywhere, Poe has become comedian, and Luke gets the worst of it all. Only "character assassination" can describe what has happened to him.<br/><br/>The tone of the movie is all over the place. It's "dark", but it has so much Marvel-style quips that it feels like a parody of itself. The pacing is non-existant. Scenes are juxtaposed all the time.<br/><br/>In summary, I can't believe I want George Lucas back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I went into it, with the hopes of seeing a space epic that with be talked about for years to come, but all I got was a two and a half hour movie that left me questioning so much. For starters I checked my watch multiple times, because the movie felt like it was taking an age to get where it wanted to go, but then it actually never got there. There was sub plot that were totally unnecessary to the overall plot and plot holes that made know sense what so ever. I mean how did General Hux become a General, he has got to be the most incompetent fool in the whole galaxy. Ok let follow there ships for hours than seems like a great plan, really you have a crazy amount of weapons and ships at your disposable, jump ahead a light speed and cut them off. Literally do anything else than what you did. I mean the start where he is being messed with by Po was so bad if he was so determined to kill the resistance then he would have destroyed the x-wing and moved on. Are the First Order not the bad guys? shouldn't they be ruthless? So much about the movie bugged me, the Leia superman scene, the pretty much shot for shot Return of the Jedi scene with Snoke, the jokes that were just so forced they were cringe worthy. All and all a poor showing from the what was the most anticipated movie of the Year. It will make money no doubt, but it won't go down as the best movie of the Year, it's not even close.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It's as if the plot is there not to tell a good story, but to plug in some "cool" scenes. It all feels forced and jagged. Poe Dameron comes out as a retard, and so does Luke. Not to mention that the attempt to blur lines between good and evil is opposed to the very essence of Star Wars. Suggesting that only weapon dealers get something out of war? No! The entire Galaxy gets a great value from fighting for liberty! But in this movie nobody wants to help the Resistance and fight for freedom. On the other hand, everybody in the movie acts irrationally and sacrifices his or her life without any real need. This is a disgusting film reveling in nihilism, destroying heroes and all that is good, not to be replaced with some better, but for the sake of destruction itself. This movie reflects the sad state of the West today.﻿</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The pacing of the film was garbage, expecting audiences to just process all the different emotions in such a short time span.For example, In one scene, Rose is grieving her dead sister, to praising Finn as a hero, to a comedic skit between her and Finn and a taser. This was all in a span of a minute or even less. How am I suppose to feel sympathy and sadness and laugh at that stupid slapstick out of place humor at the same time? Other scenes, the fluidity of the scenes and the emotions are so scrambled and abruptly stopped with the stupid sudden comedic relief that are so out of place and overdone. It's like when a character dies, and instead of grieving or feeling sympathy, they place some stupid slapstick joke to forget it even happened.<br/>Before I watched the movie, Battlefront 2's DLC Resurrection hints at the Dreadnaught ship as being a terrifying legend. But it was taken down instantly in the beginning of the movie by a single fleet. It had built up to nothing, which was a massive disappointment to anyone who was excited to see the dreadnaught in the movie.<br/>MY MAIN ISSUE. The random irrelevant killing sprees that occurred throughout the movie that had no emotional scenes or interesting story arcs. They killed off General Ackbar and acted like nothing happened. The beginning of the movie introduced Tallie Lintra who could potentially be a good addition to the story, seeing that she is an official hero in Battlefront 2, and she literally dies in the beginning of the movie, and no one cares. Snoke is killed in an instant, yet his guards showed more of a threat to Rey and Kylo. This entire movie was so inconsistent with its emotion, plot, and overall pacing, it was like it was written by children.<br/>I understand the theme, where they search for something new and they need to get rid of the old. But my god, that doesn't mean you have to kill everything and everyone and replace them with bland boring characters. So many plot holes as well. Didn't explain:<br/>C3PO's Red Arm<br/>Knights of Ren<br/>Who the hell is Snoke (Who cares cause he died smh)<br/>Why did Luke turn into a force ghost, he didn't seem like he was about to perish?<br/>Tallie Lintra, if they were just going to kill her, why make her a hero with only TWO lines?<br/><br/>I can't believe I wasted my time with this. And to make matters worse, this is all canon. They literally threw the franchise into the garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7839582"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I'm willing to give this abomination a few points purely for Mark Hamill working hard to try and make what he was given work, Adam Driver's role as Kylo Ren who is one of the few redeeming parts of this movie, and production values that are expected with a budget and resources of the likes used in creating a (supposed) Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>However, this movie in not a continuation of the Star Wars saga. It's expensive fanfiction, and has made it clear that while you can buy a license, you can't buy the spirit or soul.<br/><br/>Luke Skywalker deserved far better treatment than he received in this movie, and my greatest sympathies to my fellow fans who wanted to see him as more than a bitter old man. A twisted old hermit who went from the brigh young Jedi whose unwavering faith in his fathers salvation and throwing his lightsaber aside saved the day to igniting his lightsaber while even contemplating killing his sleeping nephew and then retiring (and not lifting a finger to mend the mess he effectively created), still needing Yoda to guide him, and then dying of 'exhaustion' after a terrible 'Matrix-like' fight and death fakeout. It doesn't matter whether he comes back as a force-spirit, or whether they backpedal hard and have his death be another fake-out, because they have essentially ruined a character almost as (and more so in some circles) beloved as characters like Indiana Jones, Superman, James Bond, and so on. They have tarnished an icon. An inspiration to generations.<br/><br/>Carrie isn't treated much better, seen as giving up hope in her son (and thus, sending Han to his death when she should have come to that conclusion sooner) in a way Luke never did with Vader, and not even to mention a goofy scene more at home in a cape film than befitting and aging General/Princess.<br/><br/>The fight choreography is a mix of good, bland, to outright terrible (the guards in the throne room spend half their time dancing around and taking turns to fight). Snoke turned out to be a joke and 'decoy' main villian, which is the least interesting choice they could have made.<br/><br/>Rey, whom I actually like in TFA and considered the accusations of being a mary sue a stretch, it turns out is really the greatest force prodigy ever whom with even less training than Luke on Degobah can crack cliffs in meditation, duel as though defending yourself with a junk staff directly translates to being a swordsman of the highest skill, and lifting massive rocks with as much ease as Yoda and Palpatine (the peaks of force ability) did with the senate podiums. Finn seemed to be barely present. Poe had some interesting moments, but overall, didn't live up to the interest he generated in TFA.   Really, the sole 'redeeming' (in that it stopped me from actively walking out) element of this trainwreck was Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. Revealed to basically be an abandoned abuse victim (who believes his uncle, the great and legendary Luke Skywalker, intended to murder him in his bed after being sent to him for help. Tell me THAT isn't a formative experience that makes becoming a darksider understandable.) who feels alone and abandoned (and projects HARD onto Rey), and whom they are clearly and blatantly signalling the redemption of. By the end of the movie he is effectively what dark Anakin Skywalker aspired to, leading 'his new Empire', intending to bring peace and security to the galaxy. With Adam Driver's performance and presence, this would have been an amazing capstone to a film... set long after the original cast have passed into legend as their great-great grandchild or something. Instead, everything (and all our beloved heroes) are destroyed morally and physically to service his character. Even Rey seems to spend the majority of the movie motivated by him. Kylo Ren is at this point basically the main character, and while that should be a questionable thing, it turns out to see the only thing that kept me in my seat til the end.<br/><br/>This movie is an utter betrayal of the soul of Star Wars. It destroys the legacies of heroes we grew up with in an attempt to service new ones, and ruins all of them by doing so. Nothing is sacred. I would have preferred bland and predicable over this mess. It's 'new and exciting' in the same way as going on a date with a depressive and violent alcoholic whom you knew back when they were a wholesome family man.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7839343"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">As hard for me as it is to write a negative review about a Star Wars film, here I am. What i can say that is that what it does good, it does good. What it does bad, it does bad. First of all i'd like to start with the good. Starting with an absolutely stunning space scene with amazing visuals, fantastic state of the art CGI and unbelievable camera work, this film sets it's self out to be the best looking Star Wars film ever made. Director Rian Johnson has got this part of the film right providing fans with two and a half hours of jaw dropping scenery and visuals. Not only this but there are a load of nods to past films and like the dice from "A New Hope" and yes this is a spoiler but Yoda coming to Luke in force ghost. There a loads of moments throughout the film that will make a true Star Wars fan really squirm with excitement, I mean i cheered alongside many others in the cinema when Yoda appeared. The space fights are outstanding, the planets, the old rebellion ships the use in the final act are stunning alongside the scenery but the big question is, do the positives outweigh the negatives?<br/><br/>Starting with Finn and Roses subplot. This was so out of place and poorly paced. Overall they ended up having no major effect on the film or anything that happened, Finn was wasted and Rose just felt so forced into the film, the love triangle it potentially creates is just unnecessary and i found it somewhat irritating. Finn does *Spoiler* kill Phasma but it was in such a poor underwhelming fight that really makes you feel like director Rian doesn't care about his characters at all. I think everyone went into the cinema expecting Phasma to take a more prominent role because her character is actually so cool and her costume is insanely nice. Phasma kind of falls into a Boba Fett thing where you still admire how cool she is but everyone knows how wasted that character actually is. The fight lasts all of a minute and it doesn't even end up REALLY being Finn that kills her. I really loved the scene with Rey, Kylo and Snoke. I say that but i also fundamentally disagreed with it. This whole scene literally takes every single ounce of curiosity that EP7:TFA left us with and throws it out the window. Who is Snoke? Who are Reys parents? IT LITERALLY DOESN'T MATTER. Snoke dies and Reys parents are NOBODY. I honestly can't understand the direction they've took this in and that upsets me. Luke Skywalker, the hero, the legend and now the scared old man with no fight in him, oh and also the dead man. Luke's character feels the furthest away from being Luke Skywalker that he could ever be. He literally wanted to kill his nephew, the man who literally nearly gave his life for his Dad to return to the light side of the force got scared of his nephews raw strength and dark thoughts and literally pulled a lightsaber out on him while he was sleeping and then payed the price leading him to exile. This is the worst possible Luke storyline for me. Mark Hamil himself has said he disagrees with everything they did with Luke. It just makes no sense to me. We don't get to see any cool force scenes with Luke, any lightsaber scenes, nothing. Infact there isn't an actual lightsaber fight in this film. Luke dodges a few attempts from Kylo but that's literally it. How depressing. The final complaint of mine is how underwhelming Luke's death is, i mean surely if you have the balls to kill of such an icon you have to make it epic for the fans? Well that's not at all what we got. Luke uses the force one last time to make what i'll call a force hologram tricking Kylo into thinking he is there to distract the First Order so that the resistance can escape.. or rebels at this point? That was confusing too. Luke dodges attack from Kylo a couple of times, beautiful scene and everything but then finally he stands down and pulls an old Ben Kenobi 2.0. Doesn't quite say the same thing but does the whole "Strike me down and i'll" thing. Kylo strikes him and he's still stood because it's a hologram. By doing this Luke uses all his force maybe? I don't know this isn't made clear but he dies while watching the two suns of the planet he's took exile in set, in a new hope fashion. Luke did not get the ending he deserved. I'd rather go on believing Return of the Jedi was the end of his story. Verdict.<br/>This film creates new possibilities in the Star Wars universe while destroying and missing so many opportunities to please original fans. The sub plot was weak and the main story provides poor answers for massive questions, had they got this right this film could be compared to or better than Empire Strikes back but unfortunately it falls short where we really needed it to exceed expectations however the film is action packed and lots of fun with some misplaced humor creating so cringey moments but some beautiful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Completely disregarding the mythic nature and scope of this fictional universe, the character and story. The arrogance that was displayed before by ignoring George Lucas' story for the sequel trilogy, thinking they knew better about his own imaginary universe, is brilliantly materialized here, with the powers that be completely ignoring the classic character arcs and defining traits. Before, it was Han Solo that was reverted back to the selfish life of a smuggler. Now, it's the compassionate and selfless Luke Skywalker that secludes himself in fear and considers commiting murder based on a possible future. Besides disregarding characters and story, it also plagiarizes The Empire Strikes Back (not unlike The Force Awakens did before). The Empire vs Rebels on Hoth is displayed here. So is the secluded Jedi Master (except where Yoda did it out of necessity, here it's done out of choice) reluctant to train a Jedi wannabe, along with many other things. There's also no story or emotional investment in the characters. I was apathic through the whole thing. Questions needlessly created by The Force Awakens are not only not answered but ignored. It's a mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I thought the movie was good - not great, as the majority of the critics are saying. First, the positives: It's beautifully filmed - quite possibly the best looking film in the franchise. The action is brilliant as well - superbly executed dogfights and light saber duels. Mark Hamill and Andy Serkis are mesmerizing whenever they're on screen. And finally, BB8 is freaking awesome! Now for the negatives: Snoke is HEAVILY underutilized - watch the movie and see for yourself. It's a shame really as Andy Serkis does a fantastic job portraying him. My second gripe is the lack of chemistry between some of the characters (Rey and Luke, Kylo and Rey). Lastly, the plot doesn't progress all that much from The Force Awakens. Because of this, the movie feels like it drags sometimes.<br/><br/>Well, those are my thought on the movie. It's good - but definitely not a game changer as the critics would have us believe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The movie pretty much begins where 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015) left off, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has finally found Luke Skywalker (a powerhouse Mark Hamill), and is ready to take her training. Gone are the days of her being a desert scavenger on the planet Jakku, and she has become what she never thought she could be. The Resistance is back with Leia (the late Carrie Fisher), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega), as they try to escape the First Order after the destruction of Starkiller Base, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is not wasting any time as he is being constantly tested by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). Now, I already know that just by explaining the plot, it already sounds similar to 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back' (1980), but no... it isn't. There are similarities for sure, and similarities to another "Star Wars" film which I won't mention, but you'll know when you see it. Director Rian Johnson ('Brick' and 'Looper') was adamant about how this is a more "different" Star Wars movie, and he is right. Aesthetically, this is one of the most stunning "Star Wars" movies I've seen, there is a lot of uses of the color red here. Not to mention that Johnson does break some rules (if I can say that) regarding the "Star Wars" lore and mythology, but at the same time, he also shows us how powerful something like the Force can be, and we may not have realized that. There is one scene however, which turns away from all that. Without spoiling too much, let's just say that there is a small plot where two characters have to travel to a particular planet to find something, and while on that planet, it feels like a completely different movie (maybe this was Rian Johnson's intention). The scene does go on for a bit too long, and ultimately, I could do without it. For 2 hours and 32 minutes, cutting out that scene would shave at least 20 minutes. The main reason why I would prefer "The Force Awakens" more is because that movie's plot was minimal and simplistic, despite it being infamously similar to 1977's "A New Hope". But it had great character development, and fast-paced action, and the story never lost focus. Here, just with that one scene, it did lose just a touch of focus, but Rian Johnson isn't afraid to throw so much at you. This movie tells a brilliant story regarding where our main characters go, and what fate lies ahead of them. There are also so many plot-twists in this movie, breaking the narrative code and taking as many risks as possible, this might just be the most complex entry in this iconic franchise. Obviously, I really enjoyed this movie, and cannot wait to see it some more. It is a fantastic follow-up to a very entertaining "The Force Awakens", and is sure to open more doors for the upcoming "Episode IX", Rian Johnson clearly has a unique vision for this franchise and its characters that no other director - not even George Lucas or J.J. Abrams - would dare to take. Johnson took some risks, and for the most part, it paid off, which makes his upcoming "Star Wars" trilogy all the more anticipated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

How the hell did a master force user allow himself to be taken in such a way by someone so below him. Secondly it is luke who is killed off not Leia  (who is dead in real life of course) so now instead of sending her away in a swan song amazing moment they will either have to rely on CG or some unexplained death in episode 9. There was no jedi training... none, zero... rey is on the island but basicly is told how awful jedi are and butthurt luke is and hes hung up on the past but ya nothing happens... you do see space penguins called porgs created for the soul purpose of a money grab via toys.  So luke is killed, completly wasting a character 40 years in development, no final showdown with snoke no amazing send off no... the mf literally fades into the suns... period. Snoke dies as mentioned above, this mysterious full of potential character that appeared from nowhere and somehow convinced the first order to follow him is killed off before we get any damn answers... Another wasted character..<br/><br/>Did you like phasma? Too bad, shes dead now too.. yeah... kylo does a brief moment of light side **** making us think the story will pick up when he kills snoke but nope, it was only so he can rule... So now this powerful sprawling army of the first order just happens to be cool following him for no reason just because? Ladies, dudes... This movie answers nothing and kills off the best parts of the series in the worst most un-thought out ways possible. And no you don't find out who rey is.... I'm not a fanboy who hates new star wars movies because i can't let go of the originals in fact i loved episode 7 because the promise it had and strong characters it teased, the story had such promise but now its dead, the prequels look like gold compared to this. I do not blame the actors... This is the fault of writers and directors. It is crap and I mean it 100%</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The plot is disjointed and stupid. The action is bland, the space battles lack in scale and logic, with 1 fighter being able to destroy all of a huge dreadnought's cannons. As for lightsaber duels, well, there ARE NONE FOR F**K'S SAKE! And the one fight using sabers has horrible choreography that is nowhere near the spectacle of acrobatic battles of the overly-hated prequels.<br/><br/>The characters also f**king suck, both old and new. The largest new addition is an ugly fat (I mean, body-positive) Asian chick who is extra-annoying. As for the old ones, Kylo and the Ginger still act like hysterical children whereas our Wonder-Girl can still do amazing feats of the Force with no prior training, like holding a ton of boulders like it ain't sh*t.<br/><br/>The huge problem is that Episode 8 has managed to blatantly flush the intriguing stuff from Force Awakens down the toilet. Big SPOILERS ahead.<br/><br/>Made theories about who is Snoke? Nevermind, he is just a CGI model with no backstory who dies after a stupid cliche villain monologue.<br/><br/>Thought Phasma would be an actual character, a leader of the stormtroopers? Nah, she is just an extra who also wastes the chance to kill off the heroes to die in an utterly stupid way.<br/><br/>Hoped that Luke would kick some ass for the old times' sake? WELL HELL NAW BOY HE'S JUST GONNA MAKE SOME F**KING HOLOGRAM OF HIMSELF AND THEN DIE OF NOTHING!!! (How the sh*t would he even make that "hologram" on another planet with the Force?)<br/><br/>Theorized as to who would be Rey's parents? Lo and behold, they are noname off-screen motherf**king bums.<br/><br/>Sounds amazing right? To add to that there's garbage like:<br/><br/>Boring talks about Hope and Resistance; Yoda's cameo who looks like a plastic piece of sh*t from the old movies, talks nonsense and somehow spawns a bolt of lightning even though Force ghosts have never been able to interact with the physical world before; A space casino which looks like a normal Earth casino but with some silly creatures; Leia survives in outer space and flies like Superman though she has never displayed any knowledge of the Force except for some connection with Luke; A lot of sugar-cutie (ice foxes) and disgusting ("Porgs", that thing with nipples) creatures designed so the incarnation of Satan aka "Disney" would sell merchandise; The annoying Asian prevents Finn from stopping the ram thing for no reason.<br/><br/>This isn't even close to everything wrong with this movie, just what I remember off the bat. It's one of the two films that I've ever given a 1/10 to (the other being Movie 43) and the single worst movie in the Star Wars franchise. I now have zero willingness to see Episode 9 or that trilogy that will be written and directed by this movie's creator, Rian "worthless f**kbag" Johnson.<br/><br/>The Star Wars are dead, baby. Was fun while it lasted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

This film is amazing, there is no doubt about that, the action sequences are fantastic, the character development is better than in any other Star Wars film and the Actors, both new and old, are performing to the best of their abilities. Although the themes in this film are maybe a little darker than The Force Awakens, it still manages to combine comedy elements with more meaningful moments, something Star Wars has always been able to do. The only issue I had with the film was its pacing, I guess when you start off in the way this film does you have to expect the it to slow down, but I feel like The Last Jedi took a little too much time before we were treated to some more of the amazing action sequences that the film does so well. Overall this film is a fantastic addition to the Star Wars universe, picking up where The Force Awakens left off and leaving the trilogy perfectly poised for Episode IX.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

First this is the worst fking blockbuster star wars fan film I have eve seen its worse than the freacking prequels can you believe it. This is not a star wars film, let alone a film. Rian Johnson and Disney has managed to do what George Lucas couldn't do, which is utterly sanitised Star Wars into a toy commerical with cheesy cliches, barren plot with no story, dumbed down social commentary and a joke - a very long joke for the money in your pockets. I really feel sorry and sad for Lucas at this stage, the guy is decent and cared about his myth, but its finally over, Star Wars is finished at this point. Everything about this film is rubbish, the music, cinematography, fighting, lore, characters, dialogue, lighting, plot, argh every fukin thing is rubbish.<br/><br/>Lets be clear here, if you never seen Star Wars before and don't care about anything else, then this film might work on a technical level. Other than that, this so called 'film' is 2.45 hours of bore where literally characters enter and go as they please, with little character development, pure **** scenes of expositions and boring cliche action like omg its the last bomber - will she be able to drop the bombs? oh damm she can etc etc etc. Oh god the black guys going die? Oh wait the other minority character going to save him... geezus **** Honestly, there's not a single lightsaber fight in this scene, and when there is action its highly choreographed like a music video. The film is also full of sexual imagery that is truly disturbing. At one point, BB 8 becomes a phallus ramming at the side of the ship, whilst another scene we get Luke milking vigorously an animal with **** before drinking the milk like a girl would drink the seeds of a man before giving the audience a stare only rape victims would know. Its so bizarre. The franchise is finished at this point. It disrespects the lore that came before it but also seems to not give a flying fck about the Force Awakens. What happened to the Knights of Ren? Who are Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? The movie's simple answer is "WE DONT CARE". Also, all the retraded people saying how this is original and the best episode since ESB are 1) fkcing retarded and/or 2) corporate shills. The Last Jedi is so unoriginal in that it just copies all the iconic scenes in the OT trilogy. Battle of Hoth. Tick. Meeting dark baddie in throne room and trying to convince the conflicted villain to betray their master. Tick. Obi wan v darth vader fight where one of them vanish. Tick. Training montage. Tick.<br/><br/>Techncially the plot doesn't go anywhere for a large chunk of the way, with the worst jokes littered every 10 minutes. General hux is reduced to general hugs and the audience is supposed to laugh at this whilst the resistance is about to be blown up. The film story is laugable simple which is that the resistance is running away from a bigger ship. That is it. Nothing new, nothing special, its just Empire Strikes Back reduced to a ****ing chase sequence that doesnt even feel like a chase sequence because they keep telling us they have like hours to go by. The film also jumps to so many different places and minor events that tension never builds. Theres a particular bad leap of logic at the end, where after Rey battles Kylo and escpaes, its never shown how she gets to the millenium falcon and then suddenly comes to Crait undetected with a ****ing fleet of First Order ships. She then magically disappears for most of the battle, whilst the film focuses on Poe and Leia **** whilst the black and asian character decides to see who can committ kamakazi the quickest. She then magically comes back to lift some rocks before meeting Poe for the first time. Yes that because we have to remember these characters actually never met until now after 5 hours of screen time in this triology. Its so awful and cringe that I wanted to die. There are so many plot contrivances like this throughout the film, like BB8 magically espcaing and using a walker to let Rey espcae, people flying in and out undetected, some awful character motivations like why does General Holo (the purple lady) just tell Poe the plan all along.<br/><br/>Dialogue lines are so wooden that they feel like from a Ps2 game, definitely watch the scenes with Rey and how **** of an actress she is giving some of the worst written dialogue since Attack of the Clone. There are no emotional stakes in this film, nor is there any entertainment. Scenes that almost show tension are almost inevtiable cut to something else in a split second, and also characters seem to come and go as they please. Whilst the Canto blight world intiially might seem interesting, it is by far one of the worst subplots in history as it goes nowhere but becomes a Greenpeace SAFE commerical about racing horses.<br/><br/>Well done Disney, well ****ing done. You've done it. Youve managed to make the worst Star Wars film. This so-called Trilogy is sad and disgusting. May the force fking kill your company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Have you been disappointed when it turned out (in “Attack of the Clones”) that R2D2 has boosters and can actually fly? All of “The Last Jedi” is like that. And I d mean – all of it. Worst writing in SW canon: too lazy to build upon established mythos, it changes tone and rules to the point of self-parody. There are some good (even great) ideas… poorly executed. Meaningless dialogues go forever. Every time you think film will make a bold, interesting turn, it hits you in the face with childish humor (there are tension-breaking burps, people!), out-of-character gesture, forced and/or predictable twist… Lacks charm, heart and thoughtful message. It’s just a desperate attempt to push the saga towards easily merchandised pulp. They threw a twist after twist and all the comes out of it is that you get screwed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

That's what this franchise is becoming - the lowest common denominator that sacrifices innovation and nuance to appeal to the masses through fan service and cheap, poorly timed humor. That doesn't make it a terrible movie or universe, it just makes it tragically mediocre. As much as it pains me to say it, I'm done getting excited about this franchise. It's pretty clear that it's becoming less of an artistic expression of fantasy and more of a cash cow than anything else. That's the real tragedy in all of this.<br/><br/>You were the chosen one, Disney!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I didn't connect with a single character due to the lack of development. The Force Awakens was far from perfect but I found myself invested in Rey and Finn, but this time around I just didn't care for them. Rose was a laughably poor casting decision, and there was nothing interesting about Rose and Finn's plot line. Disney definitely stressed having a "diverse" cast, and while the cast was talented for the most part, the dialog was mediocre to bad, which should be blamed on the director. For the record, I'm a fan of Rian Johnson's previous films, but he just wasn't the right fit for this film. The Last Jedi relied on cheap gimmicks as a crutch rather than building the story on emotion and suspense.<br/><br/>With the run time of 2 hours and 33 minutes, this movie dragged for far too long, and overstayed it's welcome. The Last Jedi is a definite black eye to the Star Wars franchise and is as bad(if not worse) than the prequels. Personally I found Episode 3 to be more enjoyable than this mess. There was just too much missed potential here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I did not like Episode VII, although beautiful, it felt to much like a "mash-up" of the first trilogy (a robot with a mission on a desert planet finds the main hero etc etc... death star... stormtroopers) where it should have a been a new story completely. Suffice to say that episode VIII is a better movie but we are far from saying it's among the best of the whole franchise. I won't spoil the movie but if I have to summarize, the intentions are there but the execution is not successful. We can critize the second trilogy but Lucas tried to create different environements, worlds, visuals and the way the Empire rose made more sense than how this "First Order" became so powerful !! Apple fired Steve Jobs... look what happened when he came back... Disney should do the same with Lucas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
