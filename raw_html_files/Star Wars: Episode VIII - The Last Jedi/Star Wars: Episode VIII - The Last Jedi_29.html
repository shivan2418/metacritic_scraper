Can barely remember one scene that didn't make me cringe at the crap awkward dialogue, shoehorned eccentric characters, or unbelievable situation that could have been handled much better by anybody halfway rational.<br/><br/>- Movie is one drawn out boring battle<br/>- Plot is boring, tedious, and verges on the unbelievable<br/>- Most of the side characters are boring as hell with godawful acting<br/>- We don't find out who snoke is<br/>- All powerful snoke dies like a b*tch<br/>- Luke skywalker turns into a moping old man literal animal tit*y sucker - Phasma is wasted and not scary or intimidating in any way. How is she a Captain if she can get owned by an ex storm trooper?<br/>- Leia can survive in outer space when Jedi's past have never been able to do that<br/>- Rey is great and can do everything with no training of any sort aside from a handful of wise words from luke<br/>- Po (only interesting character) is made to be impertinent and make decisions out of turn<br/>- No attempt is made to boost the rebels morale when they know they are all about to die a slow death at the hands of the empire. Purple haired feminazi could have let them all in on the plan but chose not to just to cause controversy for the movie. - Luke/ Kylo back story was lazy and unemotional<br/>- We still don't know who/ where the other knights of Ren are<br/>- Luke dies after astro projecting. Why? Obviously they killed him off because of creative differences. Then again, Rey is competent in everything Jedi so guess she doesn't need luke around anymore.<br/>- Mystery around reys parents was such a let down.<br/>- Yoda makes an appearance for literally no reason.<br/>- Just what the F*** at this whole movie. We don't know anything more or anything less from TFA. Literally.<br/><br/>Only good thing about this movie was the new design AT-AT but that's not enough to even gain a point in rating.<br/><br/>Save your money, this whole movie was garbage. P.S. And we just HAD to have the purple headed feminazi freak put the evil bad white man in his place with revenge womansplaining LMAO disney can go FU** themselves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It is easily the most (only?) postmodern mainline Star Wars film, which is not going to sit easily with some. Sure, it's still "good guys vs. bad guys", but it's also more complicated and deeper than that. The film is not perfect, not many are-- However, it adds depth to the post-Lucas saga and doesn't skimp on the tried-and-true Star Wars elements, either. If The Phantom Menace was, as Lucas put it, a film for children, Last Jedi has more lofty ideas. Far more often than not, it expresses them impressively well. Where much of the poignancy of The Force Awakens was the result of genuine but not cheap nostalgia, here it feels more driven by story, character, and acting. If you want to pick apart the minutiae of what "can or can't" happen in space or plotting details, the fruit is there. But honestly, are those things really what the Star Wars films have been about? As a space opera, The Last Jedi is more than good, and it's very good on several other levels, too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

But through music themes, motifs, and other symbolism the narrative of the previous movie made a promise of some type of explanation to the audience.  That means when we watch a Star Wars movie their is no guarantee that a creator will commit to any of the promises they imply.  No implying in the previous movie then I wouldn't care, but I feel like the director had only contempt for what JJ created and promised us.  And the running teaser for her parentage?  That's 4th wall 4th grade teasing.  Just pathetic.  If they won't commit to promises, I will never promise my money to a single star wars franchise product ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I will say I knew going in that Disney is unfortunately obsessed with promoting its left leaning SJW politics into its movies. I would highly suggest they refrain from doing this as it’s extremely distracting while watching the movie to be patronized. It’s like they think we are dumb and don’t realize what they are doing. That said, it was extremely entertaining in parts. Overall, I was entertained, and I tried my best to just roll my eyes at some of its ridiculousness. If Disney wants to make a movie about why you shouldn’t go to war, don’t you think it’s a bit odd to do it in a movie that is glorifying explosions and conflict in slow motion? Lol. Make a separate movie about that please. Shove it full of your politics, just please for the love of God and for everything that is decent in the world, I beg you to leave it out of our Star Wars films. What I liked:<br/>Greatly entertaining opening sequence. Cool scenes with Snoke, but only two…<br/>Fight scene with the imperial samurai looking guards<br/>Luke’s scene at the end, very emotionally satisfying<br/><br/>What I loathed/hated:<br/>Leia flying, WTH? What were you smoking Mr. Johnson?(LAME)Just have her get injured but doesn't die. Rose and her SJW warrior babble, Johnson managed to create a character more annoying that Jar Jar Binks(LAME). Her sister seemed way better for the 15 seconds of screen time. Lora Dern’s Purple hair. WTH? Is this the Hunger Games? Really distracting<br/>Luke being a curmudgeon(LAME). Seriously, Rey hands him his first lightsabre he was holding when his hand got chopped off by his dad. I don’t think he would throw it. It would have been so much better if he wanted to train Rey, but she doesn’t want to for some reason. I would have preferred him to be a more valiant character like Ben Kenobi.<br/>Snoke getting killed with no backstory.(LAME)<br/>Captain Phasma appearing to get killed (Lame)<br/>Kamakaze pilot Dern (LAME). Why didn’t all he other ships do this first? Speeches about evil arms dealers by Rose and Benicio Del Toro(SOOO LAME)<br/>Whole CANTO BLIGHT SUB-PLOT (LAME)<br/>Whole premise about can’t catch one space cruiser running out of fuel? (LAME)<br/>Clone copy of scenes elements from Original trilogy. (BB-8 popping out of an AT ST like Chewbacca), (Hoth like Trench with resistance fighters and encroaching AT AT’s), Benicio Del Toro double cross, just like Lando in Empire. (ALL LAME) I didn’t like Abram’s TFA very much and I don’t care much for the Finn, Rey, Poe or Ren, as they are not very likeable. So not really looking forward to Episode IX, Abrams gave Johnson an easy slam dunk and Johnson his handing him back a deflated limp pile of Dooku.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Laura Dern's character is rendered completely obsolete by Luke Skywalker doing later in the movie exactly what she does: sacrificing hersefl acting as a decoy for the rebels to escape. Benecio del Toro's character doesn't add anything to the story, it's just like a fake Lando. These errors are the most apparent, but there are just so much info in the story, so much plot twists and climatic scenes, it doesn´t quite capture the epic feeling of this particular fantastic universe.<br/>It's really dissapointing, in a way that even the prequel trilogy, with all its mistakes, never was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The CGI was great everywhere, and the sound design for a particular beautiful scene was extremely effective. However, the plot is lazy and boring. The dialogue is probably the corniest Star Wars has been since Episode 3. There's a whole 35 minute side-adventure that a few characters went on that adds nothing to the movie, distracts the viewers from the tension of the main story, and was just a generally boring sequence. The movie suffers from the problem of "if only the characters had just talked to each other, this wouldn't have happened", and to me, that's just very lazy writing. The acting overall is mediocre. Adam Driver knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of his internal conflicts, but the other actors and actresses did not impress. I've heard some reviewers complain about some new aspects/capabilities of the Force that haven't ever been shown in the Star Wars movies before, but I personally have no problems with it. The Star Wars universe needs to expand somehow, and that's fine by me. Three out of ten stars, one for the visuals, one for the Porgs & BB-8, and one for Adam Driver.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I know that most of us want some things to happen in a certain way because we are fans, but if that was the case, then there would be no surprise and no moving foward to the franchise.<br/><br/>Things I hated:<br/>-Leia Superman<br/>-Daisy Ridley's mediocre acting at the 1st half of the film.<br/><br/>Things I liked:<br/>+Everything else<br/><br/>This movie was never boring and had some awesome fight scenes. Most people are sad because of how the film went, for example: when did Luke did something powerful in the originals? Never!, he only tried to turn his father to the light. Fans put a lot of old characters in a pedestal and that's why they didn't liked this film. Rey's parentage was also very well handed, but fans disagree wanting her parentage to be from a known family. But isn't the galaxy inmense or infinite? Fan theories are only that, just fan theories. If she would have been from a known family like Kenobi, Skywalker or Palpatine that's just lazy and making the galaxy more little than The Bahamas islands.<br/><br/>Overall this film is about the new generation & letting the past die, it's original and doesn't copy Ep. V. The way it ended, it will certainly make Episode IX a very unique film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

That being said, TLJ could easily be used as a litmus test for an individuals emotional and intellectual maturity. I think what is most shocking to me is that this film should have been a bit of a lay up for Writer/Director Rian Johnson. TFA was not an incredible film by any stretch of the imagination but it did succeed in setting up loose ends. Loose ends that needed tying up in this film. The movie had no balls. Instead of giving us definitive answers, it often told us that the questions were stupid. I'm just upset that we have to accept that THIS is how Luke Skywalker goes out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It looks like it was reedited and some scenes were added later, like it was directed by multiple people. I doubt that director had any saying in the final cut.    Compared to the original trilogy everything looks cheap and small with fake looking CGI. Acting goes up and down, some scenes are so bad like it was just quick additional 1 take shoot. World state still lacks any explanation- how did we come from end of episode VI to this?    The end result is a movie so disjointed and broken in its story structure that it looks like some 12 year old kid fanfiction. These things happen when you aren't trying to make a movie but cater to different agendas and focus groups (lots of bs political insinuation that drags the movie to overstate its welcome for 1h) .    After 2 movies without a plot we are left with nothing. New characters had no real screen time to develop because movies were busy trying to exterminate everything from original trilogy while plagiarizing every possible scenes from it and doing it badly. Because that was the whole point-eliminate the old an in with the new (toys). The movie is even in its cynical 4th wall breaking moments telling this to the viewer.    There is no point in going on with the franchise, there are no real threats, the antagonists are now Bevies&Butthead and there is no real motivation for anything to happen. Fight for what? Against who? What do they want? Where and how they came to be? Nothing is answered. There is no context behind the plot of a movie, like its predecessor its just reenact of original movies scenes. And I have to repeat again, it shocking how cheap and BAD dramatization of some scenes is done, facepalm bad like something from a cheap old B movie.    If you like what Star Wars used to be, a quality fantasy in space for kids, don't give money to watch this thing and don't buy any other Disney related product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Like others, I feel all but certain the critics are getting bought off.<br/><br/>First, the good. This'll be quick. Kylo Ren isn't bad (he's not very scary and is rather whiny for a villain, but honestly that's pretty tame criticism compared to the rest of the movie). I like Rey, and I'm still looking forward to her maturing into a true badass in Episode IX. IMO, that'll be the only possible way to save it. Thanks to VIII, IX cannot possibly be terribly thought-provoking or deep. That's the reality of it. But it could still be fun to see Rey wantonly tearing through the Imperial ranks. Finn could also be good, if the universe around him starts making some sense again.<br/><br/>That's it though. Luke was cut down from an aspirational hero into a crotchety, world-weary hermit too cowardly to risk anything to save the lives of his family or friends, or to help the cause he believed in. To the bitter end, he was barely willing to lift a finger. And what did this to him? Losing a nephew to the dark side? His father was lost to the dark side before he knew who he even was, and he fought to bring him back to the light; even succeeded in the end. THIS is the guy who was utterly destroyed by the knowledge that his nephew wasn't all that great? Come on now.<br/><br/>Superleia? How can one not lol watching that?<br/><br/>The physics were unbelievably bad even by Star Wars standards. Bomber runs in outer space? I can't even suspension-of-disbelief that one. A "chase scene" where the giant mega-destroyer can't just catch up to the rebels for some reason? Using hyperspace to kamikaze a ship? Not only does it defy the very definition of the word "hyperspace," if it really worked that way they would have weaponized it immediately after it was invented. The entire SW universe would be a different place.<br/><br/>The side-story with Finn and Rose is nonsensical, boring, and totally unnecessary. Actually, that's a lot of this movie: unnecessary. Seriously, it's a chase scene. In better Star Wars movies, this would have been an action-packed 20 minutes followed by whatever's next.<br/><br/>Who the hell is Snoke? Here's there, then he's gone, and I never give a damn about him on e way or another. I actually thought he was kind of hilarious when he was using the force to toy with Rey and Kylo.<br/><br/>Anyway, the scene where Snoke dies is pretty badass. Give me a reason to care about who they're killing, and do that for 2 hours, and there's a successful episode IX in my book. But this... this...  so awful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

While there were a few cool parts, and the effects were very good, the character arcs for Leia and Luke were extremely unsatisfying. The humour was right out of The Avenger's playbook. The story was disjointed and lagged mightily in the middle. Unlike the Ewoks in Jedi, which had a critical role, the porgs seemingly were put in there for fans of cute things on Youtube. I get that Rian Johnson was shooting for something different, the way that Empire was different from Star Wars, but either his story was too rushed or he lacked the storytelling chops to pull it off. I'm sorry to say I won't be watching this one again any time soon. Which is too bad because this is probably the first Star Wars I won't have seen at least twice in the theatre since 1970</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I have never seen anyone actually get up and leave during a Star Wars. It’s not bad though. On a scale of 1 to Phantom Menace, I give it a trash panda. It’s worse. Way worse.<br/><br/><br/>The film felt scrapped together. Like someone at Disney grabbed scissors and spliced the movie together in an effort to make sense. The result was a hot mess of 2.4 hours that felt like it was trying hard to patronize fans based on criticisms on the prequels. What wasn’t taken into consideration was, like a fine wine, fans have actually come to understand the larger established canon. There are things in the prequels even regular folks have come around to appreciate thanks to the canon. Anyone who isn’t a fan would have felt they were in a showing of the Fifth Element. The movie is just “out there.” While the approach may work for a new film, such as Fifth Element, this is Star Wars and not a new film. It’s a legitimate and established franchise. There were established characters that had not grown. Literally. I felt as though I was watching Luke become a Jedi again. He was far more mature in ROTJedi than this movie. Relegated to a whining teen that felt that “things were not fair.” They failed in giving him the chance to make a grand entry and failed to deliver on the elusive question of “where is Luke?” That while effort of finding Luke seemed moot. Hamil could have sat this one and the movie still would have felt a bit more whole. There was no point in Rey seeking Luke in TFA. She pretty much knew all she needed to know. We get this huge build up of Rey only to find she’s less developed that she wasn’t in TFA. She’s not a legacy character. Her role felt like a teen scream role. She survives and can be killed off in the beginning of Episode 9. Pop in a new Jedi and repeat for another 4 films. This is how this movie leaves things. A soft teen flick ala Disney.<br/><br/>I still don’t understand the point of Phasma and what exactly her deal is with Finn. We had this in the original trilogy a long awaited encounter between Han and Jabba. We knew exactly why from the beginning. Luke didn’t have the monies. The gangster saw Han as a son and part of the family.  As is typical of gangsters, one shall not dishonor the family. Jabba was going to find Han for his disgrace. This disgrace would one day catch up to Han and we knew it wasn’t going to be good. It would take all the heroes to settle this and that would not be good for Jabba.  With Phasma, we still have no clue why, out of thousands of troopers, she’s obsessed with Finn, a janitor. Like he is the only defector? Shirley there are other defecfors. These are just a few of the subplots that seemed unnecessary and not worth inclusion into the film. It felt like a extended episode of a tv show. If they didn’t want these sub plots to carry over, then they could have just left them out and put more into the story or made it 70 minutes long. Instead, it’s a 2.4 hour show about the tragedy of a ship lost at sea. We saw it in titanic. We saw it in poseidan adventure. Same routine. Someone is in charge and people don’t trust their ability to lead. Whether it is a ship is going down, a war that seems to be lost, or a plan that has gone awry, there will be descent on leadership. Typically it’s gives us something powerful and either the leaders will lament that they saw no other way or fall victim of their own devices. Here, we just have a sinking ship that also represents the franchise itself.<br/><br/>Luke was wrong I’m the trailers. The Jedi don’t have to end. The franchise needs to end. We literally saw how the franchise dies. With thunderous applause.<br/><br/>I left this vague to not reveal spoilers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It had emotional and philosophical undercurrents that we've yet to see in a Star Wars film, yet it also featured some of the most striking visual moments, to date.   To be fair, the plot and acting had some uneven moments.  Without giving spoilers, there was a long-running plot thread between the First Order and the Resistance in space that seemed to drag on too long in order to allow some other plot threads to catch up in order to tie them all together.  The tonal and tension shift between different threads felt conflicting, at times, but I also recognized the film-makers' intent to avoid an emotional palette that felt too monochrome.    I felt that Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren was greatly improved from The Force Awakens, yet Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey felt flat, at times (although that might have been a product of Ren's darker and more mercurial material compared to Rey's earnest hero journey).   Note that my score is an honest 8, not a 10 to try to balance out the negativity of some other reviews.  If all the outraged users on this site were to score the film reasonably the average user score would certainly be higher than 4.9 (at the moment).  Unfortunately, many viewers apparently felt they had some ownership of the film and, it not being what they wanted it to be, have childishly given the film a '0', bringing the average down considerably.    If anyone wonders why the critics' score is higher, it's because they write their reviews after consideration and not out of a knee-jerk reaction to a few points here or there that they allowed to ruin the whole experience for them.  This film is not 'The Room'- for the craft that went into it, alone, it would be worthy of a 4/10.    Again, this is not a perfect film, and I absolutely understand that different people may like or dislike different aspects of the film for their own personal reasons.  I find it telling, however, that most people who disliked things I liked about the film resort to cheap hyperbole ('the acting is awful'; 'the writing is terrible') that doesn't really explain to anyone what was wrong or how it could have been better.  Further, anyone who feels the need to bash Disney as part of bashing the film obviously went into the theater with a predisposition to dislike the film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Absolutely beautifully made film. Hats off to Rian Johnson and boo-hoo to all you fanboys who just don't get it and wanted it to be Luke Skywalker jumping out with his lightsaber and kicking ass. The movie is asking you to grow beyond it all, in the same way Yoda says "we are what they grow beyond".  Its also why he destroys the jedi texts. I'm not surprised people aren't getting it.

Loved every minute of this film, and thought Mark Hamill delivered his greatest live action performance. Visuals were strong, characters much better fleshed out than in TFA and the story was suspenseful, touching and surprising. Not sure what film some of these other SW "fans" saw, but for my money The Last Jedi is the BEST Star Wars film since Empire. Look forward to seeing it again next week.

Not only was this the worst Star Wars movie to date, it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I made accounts for IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic just to let everyone know how horrible this movie was. I will not sit idly by and watch people give such positive ratings for something that has effectively ruined an important part of my childhood. Rian Johnson’s Episode VIII is a disastrous failure for this new trilogy and irreversibly tarnished aspects of the beloved originals as well.<br/><br/>I could write a 10 page dissertation on everything that is wrong with it, but that would be a waste of everyone’s time just like Rian Johnson’s 2.5 hour long movie, The Last Jedi. Furthermore, it should not take 10 pages to convince you that this movie sucks. The storyline is lame and full of plot-holes. The dialogue is forced and written for five-year-olds, and many of the characters are blatantly meaningless. Keeping those gripes in mind, my biggest problem with this film was the tone. It felt like this painfully long WAR movie didn't go more than five minutes without trying to make you laugh with some cheap one-liner or slapstick humor. Rian Johnson has taken one of the few things that I am truly passionate about and turned it into a joke. Do not be fooled as I was by the Star Wars label, this is no Sci-Fi epic; this movie is a comedy and a terrible one at that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

At least parts of Episode 2 were so bad that they were fun to laugh at. This movie has no value whatsoever. Instead of doing anything meaningful with the setup of TFA, they squander the characters and plot in favor of shock value and bad jokes. Humor has always been a part of Star Wars, but in the form of characters joking with each other in universe. TLJ has too many winking nods at the audience that say, "GET IT?? DO YOU GET THE JOKE???" Yes, I get it. And your jokes suck. This isn't a different kind of Star Wars story like others are saying. It's the same story but told badly, as though it was written by a teenager who just discovered they could write fan fiction. By the end of the movie we still have the same old setup of good versus evil, but this time I've lost all interest.<br/><br/>I think I'm done with Star Wars. Rogue One was pretty bad too but this is the last straw...I'm just not interested anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Many seasoned fans like me absolutely detest this movie, but not because it "takes bold risks" and "wants to be different," as if we're too immature and selfish to accept "change." Just stop using those weak straw men arguments.<br/><br/>We all know there are thoughtful, clever ways to make a unique and beloved movie by building upon an established universe and its characters. While The Empire Strikes Back succeeds in this -- being a completely different movie in tone and plot than A New Hope -- The Last Jedi strives to trash opportunities, insult fans, destroy legacies, and waste screen time, especially with respect to Kylo, Rey, Snoke, Luke, and Leia. Why? If you thought prequel elements like a 50's diner, fart jokes, midichlorians, Jar Jar, baby Boba Fett, space taxes, and "Noooo!" ruined Star Wars, then be prepared for numerous shocking and/or cringe-worthy surprises: The Last Jedi literally begins with a space-faring prank call, a bit that could have passed for a Verizon Super Bowl half-time commercial. Wow, how...creative! There is also a nauseating scene involving milking a green alien teat into a sports bottle. Again, why? Would post-divorce George Lucas even have the stones to storyboard an alien nipple? There is much more crap to say about The Last Jedi, but it was very difficult to pay attention after I wanted to walk out of the theater with my pretzel bites within the first hour. The wagon-train plot and its "epic casino mount" side-quest are boring, illogical, and unfulfilling. Most characters don't make any sense. For example, BB8 goes full-on Titanfall to save some idiots, and he becomes an actual weaponized coin bank! (I wish he'd spit some refunds back to the audience.) I think the worst thing about this movie is that it gleefully destroys Star Wars and its legacy -- things that make the movies amazing, memorable, and timeless. It treats viewers, young and old, like tools who need to be lectured or pitched a shady sale. Remember, kids: "Let the past die. Kill it if you have to." The mild twists, forced humor, and unexpected character deviations just aren't worth the costs to the culture. It'll still sell some sympathy toys, though...maybe some green alien milk.<br/><br/>Compared with the Disney safety squad who produced The Force Awakens, it seems like The Last Jedi was created in a pretentious vacuum of the most eccentric yes-men (or yes-women) with TNT-fueled chainsaws. Seriously, is this The Hateful Eight or Episode VIII? Why would film makers -- in the midst of a new, successful franchise -- flee from the potential of solved mysteries and blossoming intrigue developed by its predecessor? Why excitingly tease the audience (most of which were willing to forgive The Force Awakens for its flaws) but then crush their hopes, not even acknowledging the many abandoned questions? How far does the line have to move until Star Wars is just another Marvel or DC movie and the force becomes a slapstick mutant superpower?<br/><br/>Yes, there are many questions and dirty deeds. I'm too shocked to list them all. I've realized this whole Disney Star Wars thing is not only baffling but it's bordering on treacherous. So, I'd like to protect my good memories and watch the old movies, which are far better than this travesty. Disney has lost a life-long fan; I will not be investing any more time, energy, or money in any new Star Wars movies. That is a promise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

(thats not fair actually - harry needed to go to school)<br/>I can forgive it trashing any attempt to explain the laws of physics violations in some sort of sensible way - bombs in space ...what is that?<br/>I can forgive it having silly sub plots and  characters who are killed before we get a chance to know them.<br/>I can (just) forgive the space cows ( although I wish I could unsee them) I can forgive it a lot of things, if it was just a fun exciting film.<br/>But it's not. For some reason I started looking at my watch after about 20 minutes. Thinking about it afterwards, I think the problem is all the main characters are off doing their own thing, rather than bonding and banding together, bouncing off each other and actually involving the audience.  I couldnt give a fart in a jar what happened to any of them.  By the time it got to the moderately interesting last half hour I was over it. And they fluffed a chance to really make things interesting when the two main characters could have got together and taken the whole thing in a new direction, neither all good or all bad.<br/><br/>But the thing I really can't forgive is killing admiral Akbar like that. Come on, he is an old friend - he should have at least gone down with the ship or on some mission of bravery - just being blown out of the window by a tie fighter - puhlease. This symbolises the whole film's attitudes to its history and the fans. Yeah I get they need a new direction, and that they want to get away from the heroic narrative and they need the new cast and all that, but there were a million better ways than this.<br/><br/>The reason for all the hate is that everyone of us out here pounding our keyboards could have written a better story arc and  better reviews than what the well paid professionals have come up with. That's what makes me grind my teeth. It is nothing at all to do with the "girl power" or inclusiveness - it's to do with crap story telling and a bad plot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Visually it was stunning though lacked that 'Galaxy Far Far Away'  feel to it as everything felt familiar in an unexciting way.  Some parts worked well but for some reason the writers and director decided to through out all the history and cannon material that the Star Wars universe is built on, just to make there own rubbish up.

The humor is often a bit more "modern" than the previous movies, but doesn't get in the way of the story and adds levity in a natural way. The Last Jedi deviates surprisingly far from a standard three-act structure, which can make the film feel disjointed at times, especially with many characters' plotlines unfolding at the same time. However, dramatic tension/release is doled out in a way that keeps the film tense and engaging despite its length. I did find myself noticing how long the film had gone on about the 1h50m mark, but was quickly recaptured by an excellent last act.<br/><br/>As a meta-Metacritic aside, I feel the people complaining about the Porgs' incredibly brief and unobtrusive appearance in this film is probably just suffering from some kind of Minions-induced trauma, because they stay out of the way of the film's momentum and aren't obnoxious like some other Star Wars creatures have been (see: Gungans and Ewoks).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Not only has Disney has subverted and disrespected the original films' themes and strongest character, the new characters are bland and unmemorable.  And the central conflict is an incoherently plotted rehash of the Rebels-vs-Empire dynamic.  Also, while I was initially excited by the return of the original films' aesthetics, the "traditional" Star Wars vibe has come to feel like a sad, bland recycling since it's in the service of bad storytelling.  Star Wars has become a hollowed out shell and, based on the Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes scores, people are starting to notice.  Here's hoping Disney will course-correct, though I'm not counting on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Major characters and events from TFA are ignored or reinterpreted and this proves to be both the film's greatest strength and weakness. This is a great star wars story wrapped in an inconsistent tone and a painfully awkward relationship with the Force Awakens.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Compelling development for the new cast is scarce, a small number of noteworthy characters are unceremoniously dismissed with almost no dramatic weight and the handling of presumed 'Last Jedi' Luke Skywalker is so inconsistent with his established character and legacy that what should have been the return of a hero ends up being a bitterly disappointing farce.<br/><br/><br/>At best, The Last Jedi is a missed opportunity. To long time Star Wars fans, however, it may feel more like a cruel joke.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Often though, the guy at the top can't match their enthusiasm and skill. This movie really epitomizes that. Some of the things I liked about the previous movie were some of the questions it raised, so I was very disappointed to see those questions all thrown out in the sequel.<br/><br/>I get the feeling that the main outline for the plot was thrown together in a weekend, with no serious consideration of what had come before or what might come after. I feel I learned nothing about the past and wasn't given any reason to care about the future.<br/><br/>In politics or movies or anything else, don't step up for leadership if you don't have a vision.

With a well-crafted, insightful allegorical story line, fine performances by Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, excellent special effects and a restrained reliance on action sequences to carry the narrative, "The Last Jedi" gives viewers much to ponder while serving up an entertaining saga more in line with the original films in the "Star Wars" mythology. Admittedly it's not perfect -- a little overlong (especially in the pacing in the first 45 minutes), a little weak in its use of 3D effects and a tad too cutesy in its comic relief -- but these shortcomings don't significantly detract from the overall product. It's truly satisfying to see this franchise finally getting back on track.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The critics are bang on with their assessment here. This was awesome! I had my expectations beaten and lowered badly by these crappy user scores, and the movie delivered on the heart and action I would want from a Star Wars movie. I honestly don't get the negativity. I halfway think there's some sort of "anti-SJW" angle to it, which is really stupid if that's the case. Either that or people had trouble understanding or following what was going on. It's hard to say.  Actually the more I read reddit, the more I realize a lot of people didn't understand some of the plot points.  Some of them are pretty subtle.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect - it has pacing issues for sure, and was too long in my opinion. It could have used some editing and some of the story arcs dragged a bit. But damn, the action was fantastic, and they put in some great plot twists and surprising moments (although I saw a couple of them coming) - it wasn't nearly as cut-and-dried fan service as TFA (although I loved that one too). Honestly, people are out to lunch with this negativity.<br/><br/>Oh, and I also see complaints about the humor and jokes. Really? What series have you been watching all this time? There is a LOT of humor in Star Wars, and that's what makes it so damn entertaining. Get the sticks out of your butts.<br/><br/>Lastly, please be aware that older fans of the franchise are capable of loving this movie (I'm a lifelong fan, 45 years old) - I think some folks assume all the negativity is coming from that age group, but that's not the case.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

When you predicted everything that's going to happen, then suddenly get the carpet pulled underneath at the last minute. You either like or dislike Rian Johnson choices, but at least it's going in a new direction and not another remake.<br/><br/>As Kylo Ren put it: "Let the past die"<br/><br/>What I love about 'The Last Jedi' is how it doesn't care what you think about 'Star Wars. While not insulting you as the audience. Taking fan theories or the mystery 'Force Awakens' stet up, and shut it down completely. Instead, what we get is a bold message about are our places and where to find hope.   Rian Johnson absolutely kills it with his direction. Perfectly framed shots and the magnificent cinematography, made the overall experience something to remember for a long, long time. Even as I'm writing this, some of the imagery has implanted into my mind. Beautiful, yet menacing with the dark side creeping in. Performance and characters all around are great. Oscar Isaac character (Poe) has such a fantastic character arc in this movie, that even he learns from his cocky attitude or quick thinking from deadly situations.<br/><br/>Both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are the main dynamics of the film. The scenes with Rey and Kylo are the most captivating elements of the story. A balance of light and darkness shown in their characters. Is Kylo Ren emo? yeah, if you like. Compelling villain? YES. You see good in him from Rey's point of view, but also darkness from Luke's.<br/><br/>This is the best I've seen from Mark Hamill. You'd think he will portray an old mentor in the shadow of Alec Guinness and Yoda. However, that isn't the case. You see Skywalker has given up on the force and wants nothing from it. Becoming a shadow of himself. Heck, he barley trains Rey, and that alone doesn't matter. Seeing him on screen gave me on all happinesses in the world.<br/><br/>Sound design, costumes, visual effects, and the lightsaber fights are all top notch. The biggest issue I've heard from people is the casino scene which didn't bother me. The film itself didn't drag, for me. As the runtime feels justified for something like this.<br/><br/>Now for problems: Some CGI scenes looked a bit unfinished, which is mostly green screen backgrounds. Other than that, the effects look pretty great.  I didn't buy the "love triangle", with Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). Even Finn was just as surprised as me when this was suppose to be a thing. I rather see a relationship with Poe and Finn, than Rose. Or just be friends.<br/><br/>While I praise the film for taking bold choices, but it never fully goes for it. A lot of fake outs deaths that afterwards made me wish it actually happened. It's tonal inconsistency. One minute it's funny, then the next it's dead serious. The humor isn't as awful as people have said. Unfortunately, it doesn't help that characters are jammed packed and didn't need to be there. And Captain Phasma is still the most pointless character ever. Overall rating: Despite it's flaws, the force is strong with this one.<br/><br/>RIP Carrie Fisher, Our Princess</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The biggest is that Finn/Rose's mission is wasted part of the film.  Wrong.   The whole point of that is about character development - it is through this that Finn learns that he doesn't want to run anymore, and Poe learns that he is too hot-headed to lead and has a lot to learn - in otherwords, it reinforces the central theme of failure leads to future strength.   And it's refreshing to see that sometimes the best of intentions /plans are thrawrted.  Characters in this movie are round, not flat.  They are evolved from 30+ years ago, not static.  It's refreshing.  Beyond this, most of the points are stupid uber fanboy type stuff.   I love Luke Skywalker; I love him more now realizing that he is fallible, but redeemable.   This is an amazing movie, right up there with eps 4 and 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

It defies your expectations at every turn, and that seems to be why so many people have a problem with it. For the first time in a LONG time, I was legitimately on the edge of my seat, physically tensed up, not knowing what would happen. Beautiful thematic messages permeate the entire story (the role that failure plays in our lives, as well as the idea to "Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to"), and there is a LOT of story. The long run time is absolutely justified for me, and I honestly would have been fine with it being even longer.

While this movie definitely has a few issues, I think a lot of the criticism is that it takes familiar characters and story beats and subverts them, telling fans that they need to be able to look to the past and enjoy it but not let it tether them to what they think the franchise would be. Several characters are killed off that had potential, and while in the case of Snoke it certainly makes sense thematically, not even giving him two lines to explain where he comes from is a little bit of a misstep.<br/><br/>While the majority of the cast gets some great development, Rose and DJ unfortunately remain a little flat. I love Rose, but her feelings for Finn came from nowhere, and DJ was basically only a plot device.<br/><br/>The movie has some gorgeous shots, from space battles to the juxtaposition of red and white on the planet Crait. Using Luke to deconstruct the old ways of the Jedi was fascinating, and while he has moments of conflict and weakness, he never strays from the Luke we knew. He’s still ultimately someone who wants to help, who wants to make things right, and even through his guilt he maintains that.<br/><br/>There are moments of awkward humor, the milking scene in particular stands out to me. Of course, several of the serious moments end up ridiculous, but it wouldn’t be Star Wars without the narm charm.<br/><br/>The Last Jedi isn’t perfect, but it’s intelligent and challenges the conventions of the series while still maintaining the central themes of the series: standing up against oppression, and hope against all odds. It’s going to make fans angry, but it’s exactly what Star Wars needed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Wasn’t part of the reason that Star Wars was created was because it was geared toward children? And because of that it pioneered the mass merchandising of movies? Before Star Wars came along nobody took advantage of the merchandising of it’s characters like George Lucas. So please people (those that apply) remember why Star Wars is Star Wars. Go back and remember what it meant to be that kid again... C3PO, R2D2, Jawas, Ewoks, Salacious Crumb, Yoda? These characters SCREAM cute little eye candy for children. All from the Original Trilogy. How easy we forget when we get older and wish Star Wars would get on our level and mature (which in a lot of respects it has). Star Wars is for the kids! George Lucas himself says that Star Wars is meant to be “enjoyed by 12 year olds”. But I’m an adult and absolutely love this flick because I take it for what it is. Rian Johnson and everybody else at LucasFlim understands that and thus stays true to the spirit of Star Wars.<br/><br/>This one goes toe to toe with Empire. This movie is great! Can’t wait for Episode IX (9).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

In many ways it was quite different from the previous Star Wars films, but in the greatest way possible. Wilst boldly pushing the plot forward and being a new kind of Star Wars movie it does much more than live up to my expectations, indeed it exceeds them. Not only does The Last Jedi tastefully honor the Star Wars legacy, it dares take the storyline to unexpected places. For me it was the best Star Wars movie to date – I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and I cared deeply about what happened to the characters on screen. I love good character development and I feel that was The Last Jedi's strongest point along with the incredible connection between Rey and Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. I'm very impressed that Rian Johnson was bold enough to take the franchise in the direction he did by building on the groundwork J.J. Abrams had set up in The Force Awakens and writing this incredible story about the characters we all know and love. I can't wait to see what Abrams will do with what Rian has made here.<br/>The Last Jedi has a few delightful callbacks to the previous films without relying on nostalgia to drive it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7891391"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The Last Jedi has many good sequences and a few new good ideas but overall it is extremely inconsistent and does very little to build on any of its predecessors. It almost seems as though this movie wants the audience to just forget that the other episodes in the series happened. It offers no meaningful answers to the questions that were posed by the Force Awakens and most of the characters don't show much development. Even Luke's reasons for hiding on the island seem to contradict everything he learned in the original trilogy. The plot is full of scenarios that seem completely contrived rather than being logically justifiable. The pacing is also very jarring. Some sequences felt stretched way too long while other ones were rushed through so quickly that they seemed to condense what would have probably taken weeks into the span of a few hours. The movie also has the most ridiculously overpowered droids to date. Why the hell does anyone use human solders when droids like BB8 can take down entire squadrons? Moments like that just killed the sense of danger entirely. There are some serious dramatic moments but they were often followed by unbelievable scenes that negated their impact. The movie does have great moments and scenes though, the scene in Snoke's throne room was very good in a lot of ways but the way it ended didn't really explain anything about any of the characters. The reveal about Rey's parents wasn't just meaningless to the audience it also did nothing to explain Rey's own behavior. It felt like a mystery created for no reason besides generating fake drama and getting viewers to wonder about it. Luke's use of the Force near the end was great but once again how it ultimately ended just killed my interest in whatever happens next. Overall I was very torn on the movie, as a stand alone experience I think it is worth watching and above average but as a Star Wars movie that is supposed to develop and build upon what the previous movies did I think it fails miserably. I have seen a lot of advertising stating that the movie is full of surprises, that is true, but most of those surprises just come out of left field without any apparent depth behind them. It succeeds in being different and surprising but without really justifying itself within the established structure of the series. I really don't get the impression that Disney has a cohesive plan for the Star Wars series, it feels like they are just making it up as they go along and haven't taken the time or effort to create any sort of series bible the gives the world and story rules. This movie raises a ton of questions in terms of what can and cannot be done with the Force but I really doubt they have given much thought to it themselves. The way they use the Force seems very convenient rather than believable based on what we have learned about it over the course of the series. Some characters are able to do amazing things with the Force one moment but that makes you wonder why the hell something like that has never been done before. When Luke and Snoke use the force in new ways I can get on board with it because they are clearly powerful and have probably gained knowledge that the vast majority of Force users have not through decades of training and experience. There are other instances though such as Leia flying herself through space that seem to come out of left field and made me wonder why the hell she has never used the Force in a really noticeable way before. The scene with Force ghost Yoda also raises a lot of questions about how much Force ghosts can actually interact with the real world. One of my complaints about the movie is that while it is different it doesn't really do anything to evolve upon the questions of the last few movies. For example, we don't learn anything meaningful about the First Order, we don't learn anything meaningful about what happened to society after the fall of the Empire, we don't learn anything meaningful about Snoke, where he came from, how he seized control of the First Order, or how he was able to influence Kylo Ren from afar. Snoke has done things that even the Emperor could not but we still have no explanation for why. We don't learn anything meaningful about Rey's past, we learn that her parents were apparently just randoms which has no meaningful impact on the story. In terms of why she is so powerful with the Force or what her vision was about. The movie does offer some interesting new ideas. The Force connection between Rey and Kylo was an interesting development which has a lot of story potential. It added some complexity to how the Force can be used. Luke's astral projecting with the Force was also a very interesting idea and it was used to good dramatic affect within the movie. Snoke's use of the Force was cool and felt reasonable for a Force user who is supposed to be in a class above the rest. How those ideas develop in the next movie will be the true test of their substance though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I feel the director was more focused on creating his own legacy and forgot that he was part of the Star Wars legacy.  It genuinely does not feel like he has even seen Star Wars, never mind even been a fan of it.<br/><br/>If you have not seen it yet and consider yourself a fan of the franchise, avoid it.  There is a far higher chance you will dislike or even hate it than enjoy it.  I don't consider myself as a fanboy, read the extended universe etc.  I enjoyed the Force Awakens even if it was a bit like A new hope.  I don't even hate the prequels, I don't love them but there is a story there which I can appreciate.  Really enjoyed Rogue One, feels like a real Star Wars movie.  The Last Jedi throws the franchise under the bus though.  More Space Balls than Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

The haters are just wrong - they got turned off by opening 90 seconds of admittedly not very good jokes, which I think jolted them out of the heart-felt brilliance of the remaining 150 minutes. I spent the second half of the movie either in a mess of tears at seeing old friends reunite and rediscover their heroic resolve or mentally punching the air with cathartic joy as Rian Johnson bought together epic visual (and vehicle) design, heroic self-sacrifice, and the most successful evocation of that ’Star Wars’ vibe since the 80s (SPOILERS FROM NOW): ramming the Snoke ship at light speed, the heroic lone bomber fighter in the opening battle, the falcon intervening in the Crait battle, those speeders, all of Mark Hamill (but in particular his emotionally devastating and surprisingly athletic final lightsabre showdown with Kylo Ren - the power of this duel is quite subtle and will take a second watch to sink in), fleets of ships desperately warping through the galaxy under imperial onslaught. I even loved the middle section: my favourite childhood movie franchise showing some moral heart by raising a wish-fulfilling middle finger to the 1%, which is a really on-f***ing point message during a time of shameless inequality. Full marks for Johnson for writing it into the film. Full marks also for killing off Phasma (‘You’re Scum! Yeah, but rebel scum’ - freaking epic line!) and Snoke (what is with that terrible name), who were dead weight on the series and their absence sets up episode 9 a much cleaner Good vs. Evil final confrontation. The humour was laugh out loud: BB8’s impersonation of a mouse droid, C3P0 not being allowed to finish calculating the odds of survival, Finn playing up his ‘resistance hero’ status, Rey ‘reaching out’, Yoda rediscovering his original playful teaching methods, Luke’s ‘not-busy schedule’. Great performances by everyone (Boyega, Ridley, Carrie Tran, Oscar Isaacs all have difficult parts in this film) but Hamill and Fisher steal it, with Fisher seeming much more on her game than in TFA. But this is Hamill’s movie -  he is oscar worthy (best supporting, plz), successfully conveying a heartbroken former warrior whose heroic spirit is re-awoken in time for a final showdown, and he even resurrected some youthful attitude, spirit and cunning in his performance.<br/><br/>If you hated it I challenge you to go back and see it again and forget about the opening minutes - I’m confident the star wars joy will sink in over time. Empire was pretty bad in places but is overall amazing (we seem to always forget about C3PO’s constant whining, the stupidly repeated ’the hyperdrive is broken again’ plotting, the boring parts of Cloud city). I ****ing love this movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Disney, in all its previews, advertised the film as a serious epic focused on Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren, with no doubt some appropriate comic relief as always. What they delivered was a farce -- tripping over itself with excessive and ill-timed humor such that no scene could ever be taken seriously, even ones that were intended to be. That combined with frenetically paced cuts and transitions, too many new characters, and terribly conceived sub-plots (the codebreaker/casino debacle), meant the main story and characters were left undeveloped with few burning questions answered. Even the opening premise, equivalent to a slow motion car chase with the First Order chasing the Resistance until they run out of fuel, was absolutely ridiculous. Ultimately, the plot felt like it went nowhere, just like the Resistance ships.  Rey's supposed "training?". Didn't happen. Who was Snoke and why was he built up as so important in The Force Awakens? No answer. Who is Rey and are her parents even relevant? Still no clue. The relationship between Rey and Finn? Left languishing. Who are all these new characters? No time to find out (or even--truly--to care) despite the 2hr. 30 minute length.  Perhaps most unforgivable of all, however, was the treatment of Luke Skywalker. While a dark and withdrawn Luke was initially promising, his diminished role and ultimate end were insulting to his character and, frankly, made no sense. Disney will make a lot of money on this film so I doubt the significant criticism from fans will matter. Regardless, Disney can't hide from the fact that they had advertised and promised a new epic Star Wars film. What they delivered was a cheesy, ill-conceived, poorly-written caricature of one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

While we can all agree that the original Star Wars is a sci-fi fantasy, it still managed to maintained a sense of humanness and structure that took viewers there and connected us with the characters. I understand that it was challenging to blend the old with the new, but Episode XII was a tremendous start! Conversely, it requires no skill or creativity to take Star Wars in a completely different direction and undermine everything that has made Star Wars special all these years. However, it takes a lot of guts to ruin something like Star Wars, so I do give them credit for having the strength to do that. Revenues are strong this year because XII was great, and I believe a lot of disappointed viewers went to see the movie a second time to try and gain a better understanding. Unfortunately, it still makes absolutely no sense to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Because I wish it was. SJW garbage. I hated force awakens with a passion and have had at least 20 conversations over the past 2 years trying to explain why to morons who thought it was a good movie. This was more of the same, more weak plot, more weak acting riding the coatails of a strong franchise. They added a chinese woman specifically so that this movie would hopefully do better in China than the last one(force awakens was made with chinese market in mind and it got stomped by a chinese animated movie about bears). At this point all disney cares about is selling action figures, selling little plush stuffed animals of cute birds, and the secondary movie markets since they want to sell 1.3 billion tickets to the all their movies in China. I think my biggest issue with this is that they used the pirateds of the Carribean formula for star wars because who gives a crap. Its a good formula but does not belong in this franchise. Bascially they crapped on all the things that made the originals great trying to cash in as much as possible. Also Finn is the new JarJar except JarJar was funny once or twice. My fav part was when I though Finn was going to die, because i was like thank god they are writing him out of the movie but then Chinese girl saves Finns life and says she loves him which is hilarious because she had literally known him for less that 24 hours(when they first meet they say the ships will run out of fuel in like 18 hours), all as an excuse for her to give him a passionate kiss, the people behind me laughed out loud and said what the hell and I was like "my thoughts exactly". The third movie could be the greatest movie ever made and it still would not redeem these first two steaming turds.  I did like Rogue One so I guess that is something, too bad the new trilogy is such garbage. Also Star wars battle front 2 is complete cash grab garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Cheesy ways to kill bad guys, pointless jokes and comedy, no more epic scenes involving the Force. Simple explanations to galactic forces.. If we change the name of the movie, we could say it is a good movie but this is not Star Wars, this is some space movie about ships and weak characters killing powerful characters in a retarded way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Rian Johnson along with his puppeteers at Disney have successfully sold out the most beloved film franchise of all time for some cheap laughs and shallow, meaningless characters. From yet another painfully blatant mimicry of the cantina sequence from the original trilogy, to ridiculous and unsatisfying answers to mysterious plot points generated from The Force Awakens, this movie is nothing short of infuriating. Not only does The Last Jedi give us a collection of annoying and unnecessary characters, but it also manages to effectively ruin characters from the original trilogy we already know and love. Not to mention the plot, which is all over the place and disregards all the rules of the Star Wars universe that the previous films have put into place. Perhaps the most frustrating part of all is the movie's inability to have even a moment of seriousness without being broken up by a "witty" one-liner that ruins the entire scene. This might as well have been an avengers movie. From start to finish, this movie is overly ambitious, nonsensical, and irritating. I can't even remember how many times I wanted to stand up and scream, and I feel sorry for Carrie Fisher having her legacy disrespected with this being her final movie. I have no idea how we could have gone from the masterpiece that was Rogue One to this steaming hunk of cinematic garbage. I'm scared for what is to come after this sad attempt.<br/><br/>Congratulations Disney, you ruined Star Wars</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

Many questions are unanswered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

And I cannot agree more to that. Same with most other major characters. Actor performances were not bad at all (even some ones were really good), but they had to work with a terribad script, full of holes and inexplicable decisions. Some sparks of genius here and there in TLJ, amazing photography for sure, and the humor does not feel out of place, but overall the plot and the film itself as a whole feels worse than even EpI. The film takes the script of a pretty good film as was The Force Awakens and throws most of it through the sinkhole. Much as the Matrix sequels did with the first film. Had great expectations, found a silly film. Biggest disappointment of the year, after the great job Disney did with TFA and Rogue One.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>

I'm not going to repeat all the obvious pros and cons from other reviews, but just summarize a few:<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- Subtle racism. The minorities (Black, Asian, Latino) have the most meaningless roles via a boring subplot that had no purpose other than to apparently show that another white female character had a "better" plan that a white male. White females are mostly elevated in this film. This continues in the tradition of TFA where Finn was teased as a Jedi to sell tickets to millions of black Americans, only to later be revealed as a "sanitation" worker; the white female ended up being the Jedi. Finn is still portrayed as a "coward" in this film. Totally disagree with white "critics" who say this movie is "inclusive". Their idea of inclusivity is merely tossing in minorities just to "appear" tolerant and progressive (to me, another form of racism).<br/><br/>- The movie largely discredits many key themes & characters from previous Star Wars movies (including Episode VII). The result is that Star Wars can now be anything it wants to be, i.e. your average sci-fi movie, of which there are plenty. Instead of referring to this entry as "Episode VIII" it could have been called "Star Wars 2017".<br/><br/>- Unnecessary politically-motivated themes. These did not ruin the movie, but hints that developing a proper story was not the number one priority.<br/><br/>Many reviewers who praise The Last Jedi, tend to criticize "fanboys" for having high expectations. It's not unreasonable for fans to have certain expectations. By nature, sequential movies based on an extensive canon compels one to do so. The core fans who have invested in and sustained the franchise over the years, are the reason why Star Wars is a multi-billion-dollar business. It's reasonable for these same fans to desire to have some of their expectations met. It seems like Disney opted for cheap thrills and twists, instead of a cohesive storyline. Disney/Lucasfilm could easily have created a movie that pleased most fan types, while still having a few plot twists. Instead, they chose the latter ONLY. Any Gungan can create plot twists or unexpected character portrayals for the sake of getting cheap thrills. IMO, critics are overrating Rian Johnson as if he is another Christopher Nolan. I couldn't help but feel that Rian Johnson wanted to intentionally nullify everything that J.J. Abrams setup (almost like an ego battle between directors).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&hellip;</span> <span class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand">Expand</span></span>
